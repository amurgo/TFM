                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   A decision to make a deportation order against Mr Alleyne was taken  on
    17th June 2013, by which date he was in detention under Immigration Act
    powers at Brook House.   Lacking  a  representative,  Mr  Alleyne  gave
    notice of appeal  himself  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  on  2nd
    September 2013 the appeal came before a panel comprising Judge Rosemary
    Morris and Mrs Wilma Jordan.  The appeal was allowed under Article 8 of
    the ECHR, but permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted to
    the Home Secretary on 9th October by Judge Sommerville, and the  matter
    has now come before me.

2.   Mr Alleyne could not be  brought  from  Brook  House  for  the  hearing
    today,  because  the  escort  contractor,  TASCOR,  did  not  have  the
    resources to do so ~ a lamentable state of affairs which is not at  all
    unusual.  Rather than adjourn the case, it seemed best to me  to  press
    ahead with the 'error of law' stage.  Without  any  knowledge  of  what
    might  constitute  an  error  of  law,  Mr  Alleyne,   who   has   been
    unrepresented throughout these proceedings,  would  not  have  had  any
    useful submissions to make at this stage, and if an error  of  law  was
    identified, I proposed to adjourn the case then, so that  the  decision
    on the appeal could be  re-made  at  a  later  date,  with  Mr  Alleyne
    present.

3.   I therefore heard submissions from Miss Horsley, who  expanded  on  the
    grounds of appeal drafted by one of her colleagues  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State.   There  were  two  grounds,  the  first  of  which
    asserted that the First-tier panel were wrong to follow the 'two stage'
    approach recommended in MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT
    393 (IAC).  Permission was not granted on that ground, but Miss Horsley
    prayed in aid the Court of Appeal's judgment when MF (Nigeria) went  on
    appeal to them.  It had recently been handed down as  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
    1192, and Miss Horsley focused on the Court's characterisation  of  the
    new immigration rules in respect of how considerations  of  private  or
    family life might impinge upon  deportation,  as  forming  "a  complete
    code".  That meant, as I understand Miss Horsley, that it was no longer
    permissible for the Tribunal to look outside the provisions of Part  13
    of the Immigration Rules, when determining  how  Article  8  is  to  be
    applied in a deportation appeal.

4.   It seemed to me, however, that far from disavowing  a  two-stage  test,
    the Court of Appeal were saying that there is  a  two-stage  test  both
    inside and outside the Rules.  Under paragraph 398, when paragraphs 399
    and 399A do not apply, a Home Office caseworker, in considering whether
    there are "exceptional circumstances", in the sense  that  "deportation
    would result in  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences",  must  perform  a
    proportionality balancing exercise.  Just so,  a  First-tier  judge  on
    appeal, who finds that the appellant cannot  succeed  under  paragraphs
    399 or 399A, must determine whether, in the light of the  domestic  and
    Strasbourg   jurisprudence,   deportation    would    nonetheless    be
    disproportionate.  I need say no more on this, because it has now  been
    fully explained  at  paragraphs  15-18  of  Kabia  (MF  :  para  398  -
    "exceptional circumstances") [2013] UKUT 569 (IAC).

5.   The second ground, as Miss Horsley very properly pointed out,  contains
    some inaccuracies, particularly in asserting that  Mr  Alleyne,  having
    committed a serious offence  for  which  he  expressed  remorse  and  a
    determination not to re-offend, had "gone on  to  commit  a  much  more
    serious offence."  Indeed, his offences had "escalated in seriousness."
     In fact, after being sentenced to 12  months'  detention  (reduced  on
    appeal from 18) in a Young Offender Institution  for  possession  of  a
    Class A drug with intent to supply, Mr Alleyne had thereafter  received
    a police caution for assault and a ï¿½50 fine for possessing cannabis for
    his personal use.  Clearly, these were much less serious offences,  and
    were penalised accordingly.

6.   At paragraph 30 the panel dealt with the fact that, as  highlighted  in
    the second ground, "notwithstanding his stated intentions the Appellant
    re-offended."  They carefully considered the context in which this  re-
    offending occurred, and gave adequate reasons for forming the view that
    this time Mr Alleyne would not re-offend.  This was a  view  which  was
    rationally open to them on the evidence.

7.   Much of  the  lengthy  second  ground  consists  of  disagreement  with
    findings which the panel were entitled to reach.  The only  point  with
    any merit  was  picked  up  by  Miss  Horsley  and  was  advanced  most
    persuasively, namely that the  panel  might  not  have  given  adequate
    weight to the public interest  side  of  the  proportionality  balance.
    Although the panel's attention had been drawn to  SS  (Nigeria)  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 550, they did not quote any passage from it, in particular the
    dictum of Lord Justice Laws that "the more pressing the public interest
    in removal or deportation, the stronger must be the claim under Article
    8 if it is to prevail."  This  is  expressed  more  forcefully  by  his
    Lordship in respect of 'automatic' deportation under the UK Borders Act
    2007, whereby  "Parliament's  express  declaration  [that]  the  public
    interest is injured if the  criminal's  deportation  is  not  effected"
    means that a  result  favouring  the  foreign  criminal  can  "only  be
    justified by a very strong claim indeed."  Mr  Alleyne,  it  should  be
    remembered, is not a 'foreign criminal' for the purposes  of  the  2007
    Act, which does not apply to him.

8.   The last substantial  paragraph  of  the  First-tier  determination  is
    paragraph 43, in which, when explaining why "the  interests  of  public
    safety and the prevention of disorder or crime"  do  not  outweigh  the
    interests of Mr Alleyne and  his  British  child,  the  panel  directly
    address those interests with just the following sentence :
             "The Appellant has only had one custodial sentence and we  are
         satisfied that he has shown remorse and put in place strategies  to
         try and avoid such offending behaviour in the future."

9.   That, says Miss Horsley, is far too brief to take adequate  account  of
    the public interest.  If that was all the panel had to  say  about  the
    matter, I would agree.  But if one looks back to paragraphs 29-30,  one
    sees that Mr Alleyne was still a minor when he  was  convicted  of  the
    drug offence, was 19 when he received a police caution and was 20  when
    he was fined for possessing a Class B drug.  The only offence for which
    he received a custodial sentence was committed when he was a minor, and
    although the panel do not cite Maslov v Austria, they seem to  have  in
    mind the principle that an offence committed by a  juvenile  adds  less
    weight to the public interest side  of  the  Article  8  balance.   The
    offence was serious, but the sentence of  one  year's  detention  shows
    that it was considered to be at the lower rather than the higher end of
    the scale for drug offences.

10.  Another Maslov consideration (although again with  no  overt  reference
    to Maslov) comes at paragraph 24, in which the panel recollect that  Mr
    Alleyne has been here since the age of  10  and  "has  therefore  spent
    nearly half his childhood and all his adult life in this country."   He
    is not a 'settled migrant', but  the  panel  accept  that  he  did  not
    realise this until 2009, "when he wanted to apply for college after  he
    had completed his GCSE examinations."

11.  I have already mentioned the panel's finding at paragraph  30  that  Mr
    Alleyne is not likely to re-offend.  This is backed up by the  evidence
    set out at paragraph 25.  There was no OASys Report to assist the panel
    with a professional appraisal of the risk of re-offending, so the panel
    had to do the best they could with the  evidence  before  them.   Their
    conclusion on this cannot be characterized as irrational or perverse.

12.  Miss Horsley's best point, it seems to me, is that the  panel  did  not
    expressly weigh on  the  public  interest  side  of  the  balance  such
    factors, familiar from cases including N (Kenya) and  OH  (Serbia),  as
    the need to deter others, the expression of public revulsion at serious
    criminality, and the promotion of public  confidence  in  the  criminal
    justice system.  It was certainly an error of law not to mention  these
    factors at all, but I do not agree  with  Miss  Horsley  that  in  this
    instance it was a material error.  Looking at the panel's determination
    in the round, it is clear that, having seen and heard Mr  Alleyne  give
    evidence ~ something the Upper Tribunal has not done ~  they  formed  a
    favourable impression of his credibility.  They thought it  significant
    that his one serious offence was committed when a  juvenile,  and  they
    were satisfied that he would not re-offend.  Although not settled here,
    he had been brought to this country as a child, and contrary to what is
    said in the grounds about Mr Alleyne being "an adult who has spent  his
    formative years in Barbados", he would be more accurately described  as
    having spent his formative years in this country.

13.  The upshot is that I cannot see how the panel  would  have  come  to  a
    different conclusion, had they explicitly taken account of  the  public
    interest factors mentioned above.  To  omit  them  from  the  balancing
    exercise was an error, but it was  not  a  material  error,  since  the
    weight which could reasonably have been given to them  in  the  present
    case would not have tipped the balance in favour of deportation.  Apart
    from this omission, the First-tier  Tribunal  produced  a  careful  and
    thorough  determination,  giving  sustainable  reasons  for  all  their
    findings, which were fully open to them on the evidence.  It would  not
    be right to set their determination aside.


     DECISION

     The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.
