                                                                  Appellants
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. On 30 October 2018 I wrote to the parties as follows:

         "In a Rule 24 response signed on behalf of the Secretary  of  State
         by Christopher Bates, is the following: -

             "The respondent does not oppose  the  appellant's  application
             for permission to appeal and invites the Tribunal to determine
             the appeal with a fresh oral (continuance) hearing to consider
             whether  the  appellant  satisfied  the  requirements  of  276
             ADE(1), or Art 8 outside the Immigration Rules."

         I have little idea what this is supposed to mean.   Permission  has
         been  granted,  as  the  respondent  is  evidently  aware,  so  any
         opposition  to  the  application  for  permission  is   irrelevant.
         Further, the notion of "a  fresh  oral  (continuance)  hearing"  is
         unknown to the Tribunal's procedure.

         On the assumption that the Secretary of State  intends  to  concede
         the appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  I  now  propose  to  allow  that
         appeal, set aside the determination of the First-tier Tribunal, and
         direct a further hearing before that Tribunal.  Any submissions  to
         the contrary will be considered if received within 21 days  of  the
         date of this letter."

 2. No response has been received.

 3. I now allow the appeal to this Tribunal, set aside the  decision  under
    appeal on the ground of error of law.  I remit the appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal and direct that it be determined afresh.




                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                     Date: 29 November 2018.
