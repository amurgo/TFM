For the Appellant:     Mr R Sharma, counsel instructed by Sky Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant who is a national of Pakistan born on 13  November  1986,
    who made an application for a residence  card  as  an  extended  family
    member of an EEA national on 15 May  2015.   In  a  decision  dated  16
    November 2015 this application was  refused  by  the  Respondent.   The
    Appellant appealed against this decision and  his  appeal  came  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge M J Gillespie for hearing on  26  June  2017.
    In a decision and  reasons  promulgated  on  29  June  2017  the  judge
    disposed of the appeal without a hearing and  in  the  absence  of  the
    parties in light of the  decision  in  Sala  (EFMs:  right  of  appeal:
    Albania) [2016] UKUT 411 (IAC).

 2. An application for permission  to  appeal  was  made  in  time  on  the
    Appellant's behalf on the basis firstly that the Appellant's  case  was
    clearly distinguishable from that in Sala and secondly  that  Sala  was
    arguably not good law in light of the fact that the Court of Appeal  in
    the case of Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 had granted permission to appeal.



 3. Permission to appeal was granted in a decision dated 21  December  2017
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Martin on the basis that the grounds of  appeal
    have merit in light of the Court of Appeal's judgment  in  Khan  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1755 which found that Sala was incorrectly  decided  and  that
    extended family members of EEA nationals do  have  a  right  of  appeal
    under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 4. At the hearing before me Mr Sharma for the Appellant and Ms Brocklesby-
    Weller for the Respondent agreed that the appropriate course of  action
    in light of the judgment in Khan was that the appeal be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal for a hearing de novo given that  no  consideration
    had been given to the appeal to date.

     Decision

 5. On the basis of the parties' agreement and in light of the judgment  in
    Khan, I find that First-tier Tribunal Judge Gillespie erred  materially
    in law in finding that there was no jurisdiction  to  hear  the  appeal
    based on the jurisprudence in force at that time which has subsequently
    been found not to be correctly decided.   I  remit  the  appeal  for  a
    hearing de novo before the First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
