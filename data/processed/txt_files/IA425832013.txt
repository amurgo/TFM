                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 30th  September  1988.
    She appealed against a decision of the Respondent dated 8th May 2013 to
    refuse her application for an extension of leave as a Tier 4  (General)
    Student under the points-based system.  Her  appeal  was  dismissed  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Oliver  sitting  at  Richmond  on  7th
    March 2014 and she now appeals with leave against that  decision.   The
    Appellant wished to study for a level 5 HND qualification  in  Business
    Studies  at  the  London  School  of  Technology.  According   to   her
    Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)  her  course  was  due  to
    start on 15th November 2012 and finish on 30th September 2014.

2.   On 22nd August 2011 the  Appellant  was  granted  leave  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 Student, her leave being  valid  until  29th
    October 2012.  On that date she made an  in  time  application  for  an
    extension of leave, refusal of which has  given  rise  to  the  present
    proceedings.  The  Respondent  awarded  the  Appellant  30  points  for
    attributes  but  awarded  0  points  for  maintenance  funds.   As  the
    Appellant was studying outside inner London she needed to show that she
    had the required funds to cover the fees for the first academic year of
    the course as the course was twelve months or more and  have  �800  per
    month for two months for personal maintenance.  The  course  fees  were
    �2,500 for the first year of the course of which the Appellant had paid
    �1,500 leaving a balance of �1,000.  The Appellant therefore needed  to
    be in possession of �2,600 (�1,600 plus �1,000) for  a  consecutive  28
    day period to meet the Tier 4  (General)  Student  Migrant  maintenance
    funds requirements.

3.   The Respondent refused the application on maintenance grounds stating:

         "As the closing day of the bank statement submitted in  support  of
         your application was dated 28th  January  2013  you  need  to  show
         evidence of �2,600 maintenance for 28 days from 1st January 2013 to
         28th January 2013.   However  between  1st  January  2013  and  7th
         January 2013 your bank statements state that you were in possession
         of  no  more  than  182,866.14  Bangladeshi  taka  [which]   equals
         �1,482.87."

     At the same time the Respondent made a decision  under  Section  47  of
    the  Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006  to  remove  the
    Appellant from the United Kingdom.

The Proceedings at First Instance

4.   The Appellant  appealed  against  these  decisions,  arguing  that  she
    satisfied the financial requirements.  On the same day she took her CAS
    letter from the London School of Technology she requested  her  parents
    to send her last three months' bank statements which she  submitted  to
    the Home Office.  She showed her bank  statement  to  the  college  who
    advised her that the Respondent only checked the last  balance  on  the
    statement.  Her mother's current account had  enough  money,  the  last
    balance being 681,866.14 taka.  The Respondent's  contention  that  she
    had not shown sufficient funds was incorrect.  The Respondent  had  not
    acted fairly.

5.   In relation to Article 8 she cited the case of CDS Brazil  [2010]  UKUT
    00305 that a person who is admitted to follow a course that had not yet
    ended may build up a private life that deserves respect and the  public
    interest in removal before the end of that course may be reduced  where
    there are ample financial  resources  available.   She  was  a  genuine
    student in the middle of her studies.  The  Respondent's  decision  was
    unlawful under the Immigration Rules and Article 8.  She should not  be
    removed at this particular moment in  time  as  she  was  a  continuing
    student.

6.   At the hearing at first instance the  Appellant  told  the  Judge  that
    twelve  or  thirteen  days  after  making  her  application  the   bank
    statements sent by her mother arrived which were then submitted to  the
    Respondent.  The course she was currently undertaking which  would  now
    finish on 30th April 2015 was not available in Pakistan.  If she had to
    return she would lose the time and money she had spent  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

7.    The  Appellant  argued  that  the  evidential  flexibility  policy  as
    explained by the Upper Tribunal imposed a duty  on  the  Respondent  to
    give her an opportunity to supply any missing evidence before  refusing
    her application.  However, the Judge noted in  his  determination  that
    that  interpretation  of  the  policy  was  not  shown  to  be  correct
    (following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Rodriguez [2014] EWCA
    Civ 2).  The duty to refer back to applicants was now seen to apply  to
    only a few categories of cases but the facts in  the  Appellant's  case
    did not represent such an example.  At paragraph 6 the Judge continued:

         "The facts equally do not give rise to a private life  claim  under
         Article 8 and there is no near miss principle applicable to points-
         based claims either in the interpretation of the Rules or  relevant
         to a human rights claim."

8.   The Judge criticised the statement  in  the  refusal  letter  that  the
    Appellant might have an option to make  a  new  application.   Such  an
    application would have to be made before her current leave expired  but
    since the letter was sent well over six months after the expiry of  the
    Appellant's leave it was misleading to  have  left  it  remain  in  the
    document.  He dismissed the appeal under both the Immigration Rules and
    Article 8.

The Onward Appeal

9.   The Appellant appealed making  three  points.  Firstly  the  Judge  had
    failed to consider paragraph 245AA(d) of the  Immigration  Rules  which
    required the Respondent to make  enquiries  where  there  were  missing
    documents from the application.  Secondly the Section 47  decision  was
    invalid as it was taken on 8th May 2013, the Appellant relying  on  the
    Court of Appeal decision in Ahmadi [2013] EWCA Civ  512.   Thirdly  the
    Judge had failed to consider the Appellant's Article 8 claim  that  her
    right to a private life would be breached by the decision.

10.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew on 15th May 2014.  He wrote:

         "The grounds complain that the Judge did not consider Article 8  in
         his determination.  I can find no reference to it and thus  I  find
         there is an arguable error of law.  The other matters  referred  to
         in the grounds may also  be  argued,  although  they  will  require
         further amplification."

11.  Following the grant of permission the Respondent  wrote  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on 4th June 2014  stating  that  the  Respondent  opposed  the
    Appellant's appeal.  The Judge  clearly  did  consider  Article  8  and
    considered that it was not engaged, paragraph 6 refers.  He found  that
    there was no near miss principle in human rights claims.  In any  event
    no properly directed Tribunal could have found that  having  failed  to
    meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  the  decision  resulted  in  a
    disproportionate interference with the Appellant's Article 8 rights.

The Hearing Before Me

12.  In opening submissions on the issue of an error of law the  Appellant's
    representative stated that she was instructed that  the  Appellant  had
    submitted her mother's bank statement to the Respondent, but  this  had
    not been considered by the Respondent. For the Respondent it was  noted
    that there was a letter on file from the Appellant which stated:

         "I could not send my bank statement along with  the  application  I
         have sent to UKBA for extension of my visa due to lateness and some
         difficulties with the bank statement so now I am  sending  my  bank
         statement enclosed in the post."

     Following the case of Raju [2013] EWCA Civ 754  the  Appellant  had  to
    submit her evidence with her  application.   This  was  made  clear  in
    Appendix C paragraph 1A(a), the applicant must have the funds specified
    in the relevant part of Appendix C at the date of the application.   If
    it could be shown that the decision  maker  had  looked  at  the  wrong
    period and  looking  at  the  correct  period  the  Appellant  had  the
    necessary funds the appeal could be allowed.

13.  According to Appendix C paragraph 1B(a)(i)(iii) the  Appellant  had  to
    submit a personal bank statement which had to cover  a  consecutive  28
    day period of time and must be dated no earlier than 31 days before the
    date of the application.  As the application was made on  29th  October
    the Appellant had to provide evidence of a 28 period in a  recent  bank
    statement dated no  earlier  than  31 days  before  the  date  of  the
    application.  As the Appellant had applied on  29th October  2012  she
    would have to show that she had the equivalent �2,600 in a bank account
    for the relevant period prior to that time.  For reasons which were not
    entirely clear the Respondent's  refusal  letter  had  talked  about  a
    period between 1st January and 7th January 2013.  On the other hand if
    one went back 28 days from 7th October 2012  to  10th  September  2012
    according to the mother's bank statement dated 7th January  2013  there
    was enough money in the mother's account to  show  that  the  Appellant
    could meet the financial requirements.

14.  The issue in the case was whether the Appellant had in  fact  submitted
    the mother's  bank  statement  to  the  Respondent  shortly  after  her
    application was first lodged.  The Respondent did not accept  that  the
    mother's bank statement had been so submitted to the Respondent.  There
    was a five week period between 16th October 2012 and 12th November 2012
    when the Appellant could not satisfy the maintenance requirements.  The
    Presenting Officer could  not  say  from  the  Respondent's  file  what
    documents the decision maker had been looking at.

15.  For the Appellant in reply it was  submitted  that  the  mother's  bank
    statement had been submitted with the notice of appeal.  The burden  of
    proof on what was received was on the Respondent.  The  Respondent  had
    to prove that the Appellant had not submitted the bank statements.  The
    Respondent had not served  any  bank  statements  in  the  Respondent's
    bundle.

16.  For the Respondent it was  also  argued  that  under  paragraph  13  of
    Appendix C where an  applicant  was  relying  on  their  parent's  bank
    statement they had to provide written consent that the  parent's  funds
    may be used by the applicant in order to study in  the  United  Kingdom
    and no such consent had  been  given  to  the  Respondent  nor  was  it
    recorded in the Judge's determination. Furthermore, the  Appellant  had
    not referred to the bank statement she was submitting to the Respondent
    as being her mother's statement.  The covering letter   (see  paragraph
    12 above) had referred to her own personal bank statement  and  in  her
    application form itself she had indicated that she would be sending her
    own statement through not someone else's.

The Error of Law Stage

17.  The grounds of onward appeal  against  the  Judge's  decision  were  on
    three bases.  The first citing paragraph 245AA Immigration Rules  would
    only be  an  error  if  paragraph  245AA  was  relevant  to  the  case.
    Paragraph 245AA refers to documents not submitted with the  application
    and was inserted into the Rules from 6th September 2012.  It applies if
    the applicant has submitted a sequence of documents  and  some  of  the
    documents in the sequence have  been  omitted,  for  example  one  bank
    statement from a series is missing or a document is in the wrong format
    or is a copy and not an original.  None of those conditions applied  in
    the present case.  The Appellant  appears  to  have  submitted  a  bank
    statement but the issue is not whether there was one in a  series  that
    was omitted but  whether  in  fact  the  Appellant  had  submitted  her
    mother's bank statement showing ample funds.  The other two  exceptions
    (wrong format or copied) evidently did not apply.  It was not therefore
    an error of law for the Judge to fail  to  take  account  of  paragraph
    245AA because it  did  not  apply  to  this  case  any  more  than  the
    evidential flexibility policy applied following  the  Court  of  Appeal
    decision in Rodriguez.

18.  The second challenge to the Judge's decision was that  the  Section  47
    decision was unlawful because it  was  made  on  8th  May  2013.   This
    challenge was misconceived.  The Crime and Courts Act which amended the
    relevant passage in Section 47 that had been struck down by  the  Court
    of Appeal in Ahmadi came into force on 8th May  2013  the  day  of  the
    decision and thus the decision itself was valid.  Again it was no error
    for the Judge to fail to  consider  that  matter  because  it  was  not
    relevant.

19.  The third challenge was to an alleged failure on the part of the  Judge
    to deal with Article 8.  The Appellant was entitled to raise Article 8,
    she had been issued with a  Section  120  notice  and  the  Section  47
    removal decision.  Article 8 was potentially engaged in her claim  that
    her studies would be interrupted by her removal.  The Judge's view  was
    that Article 8 was not engaged.  I found that there was  a  failure  by
    the Judge to adequately explain his conclusion that Article 8  was  not
    engaged in this case.  Something more than  a  mere  dismissal  of  the
    Article 8 claim was required.  There was therefore an error of  law  in
    that part of the determination such that the issue of  the  Appellant's
    claim under Article 8 fell to be reheard.

20.  More difficult was the issue of whether  the  Judge  had  come  to  the
    right decision in relation to the dismissal of  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to
    demonstrate she had sufficient funds in her bank statement.  The  Judge
    had accepted the information contained in the refusal  letter  which  I
    have quoted above which if correct would indeed have been  decisive  in
    relation to the Immigration Rules part  of  the  appeal.   However  the
    refusal letter did not explain why the Appellant  failed  to  meet  the
    maintenance requirements.  The  refusal  letter  was  talking  about  a
    period which was completely irrelevant, namely the 1st to  7th  January
    2013.  If the Appellant had (as she  claimed)  submitted  her  mother's
    bank statements the figures quoted in the refusal letter were wrong  as
    the balance between 1st and 7th January 2013  was  considerably  higher
    than the amount stated in the refusal letter.  The Respondent's  bundle
    did not enclose a copy of whichever bank statement  the  Appellant  had
    submitted  and  there  was  therefore  no  evidence  to   support   the
    Respondent's contention in the  refusal  letter  even  if  1st  to  7th
    January had been the correct period.

21.  The Presenting Officer took the point at the hearing before me that  it
    was not open for the Appellant now to seek to query the Judge's finding
    that she could not meet the Immigration Rules on the basis that she had
    submitted her mother's bank statement.  I have some sympathy  for  that
    view but I am also concerned that the refusal letter did not accurately
    explain the basis on which the Appellant's application had been refused
    by the Respondent.  In those circumstances and  quite  exceptionally  I
    was prepared to indicate that there was an error of law in the  Judge's
    determination not just in relation to the treatment of  Article  8  but
    also the treatment of the claim under the Immigration Rules  since  the
    Judge had not engaged with the evident mistake in the  refusal  letter.
    I therefore indicated that there was an error of law, I set the Judge's
    decision aside and reheard the matter both as to the issue of funds and
    the Article 8 claim.

The Rehearing

22.  The Appellant attended and gave evidence.  She was examined and  cross-
    examined and re-examined. She stated that she had submitted  her  birth
    certificate and her mother's identification to prove that  it  was  her
    mother's account that she was sending to the Respondent.  She had  been
    studying for almost a year and was in the middle of her  studies  which
    would finish next year in June 2015.  The reason  why  this  was  later
    than the date on the CAS (30th September  2014)  was  because  she  had
    joined the course in July 2013 when the college called her.  The course
    was for two years and there were sixteen modules, eight in  each  year.
    She had started the course as late as  she  had  because  she  had  not
    received any reply from the Respondent.

23.  When she ticked the box in her  application  form  that  she  was  only
    relying on her own bank statement she meant that she was relying on her
    mother's bank statement treating it as her own.  She  herself  did  not
    have a bank account, all the money that her mother had  was  hers.   It
    was put to her that in her witness statement she had said that she  had
    shown her own bank statement to the college then talked about monies in
    her mother's current account, indicating that the Appellant had made  a
    clear distinction between the two accounts.  The Appellant replied that
    she meant her mother's bank account.  She repeated  that  she  did  not
    have her own account.  The course she  was  on  was  not  available  in
    Bangladesh.  If she went back she would lose her time, she could not do
    the course there.  She could show examples of her studies  and  further
    enquiries could be made of the college website.  It was really hard for
    her to survive in Bangladesh.  In re-examination she said she  had  six
    further modules to take.  She would receive her first  set  of  results
    this August.  The course was assignment based  and  she  could  provide
    those assignments if necessary.

Closing Submissions

24.  For the Respondent it was argued that the claim did not  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules and it could not succeed outside the Rules  under
    Article 8.  It was difficult to see why permission to appeal  had  been
    granted.  It was not for the Respondent to  show  what  documents  were
    submitted, the Appellant had not shown that she had submitted her  bank
    statement.  The Appellant had said in her application form that she was
    submitting a bank statement in her own name.  The  bank  statement  now
    before the court from the Appellant's mother was not submitted with the
    application or sent in afterwards.  The covering  letter  sent  to  the
    Respondent meant it was not plausible to  say,  as  the  Appellant  was
    seeking to do, that when she said she sent in her statements she really
    meant her mother's.  She herself distinguished in her witness statement
    between the two accounts.

25.  There was no suggestion that there was any letter of consent  from  the
    mother accompanying the bank statement that the  money  was  available.
    The Appellant could thus not show for a continuous period  of  28  days
    that she had the necessary funds and the  appeal  should  be  dismissed
    under the Rules.  In relation to  Article  8  the  Appellant  said  she
    wanted to continue her studies but that was not a protected right.  The
    Article  8  claim  did  not  get  off   the   ground.    It   was   not
    disproportionate to remove the Appellant.  The Judge at first  instance
    was wrong to say the Appellant could not apply  again.   She  currently
    had Section 3C leave by virtue of her appeal against  the  Respondent's
    decision.  She could make a fresh application for Tier 4 within 28 days
    of her 3C leave expiring.  She would not have  a  right  of  appeal  if
    there was to be a subsequent refusal but if she was able to  show  that
    she had the necessary funds the application might succeed.

26.  In closing for the Appellant it was argued that the Respondent had  not
    raised the issue of the  mother's  consent.   The  representatives  had
    submitted the mother's bank statement with the notice of appeal.  Their
    instructions from the Appellant were that she had also  submitted  that
    bank statement to the Respondent.  Even if she had not submitted it, it
    was incumbent upon the Respondent  to  prove  that  the  Appellant  had
    submitted a different bank statement which  they  could  not  do.   The
    caseworker had not acted fairly towards the  Appellant.   The  decision
    letter should have said which bank statement was being referred to, the
    Appellant's or her mother's.   The  refusal  letter  was  defective  in
    referring to the period in January  2013  when  the  period  should  be
    earlier than 29th October 2012.  That  was  not  a  clerical  mistake.
    There was proof that the Appellant had submitted the bank statement.

27.  The Article 8 claim should be considered on its merits.  The issue  was
    whether there were  compelling  reasons  to  enable  the  Appellant  to
    succeed outside the Rules.  The Appellant had no bank statement in  her
    own name.  She was able to start the course even  though  she  had  not
    been granted leave at that time by the Respondent because  the  college
    had highly trusted status.  She came to the United Kingdom to study and
    wanted to finish.  It was unreasonable for her to  go  back  now.   The
    appeal should be allowed to give her a chance to complete her studies.

Findings

28.  There are two issues I have to decide in this  matter.   The  first  is
    whether the Appellant can show that she did satisfy the requirements of
    Appendix C because she did submit her mother's bank  statement  to  the
    Respondent before the decision to refuse was taken.  If  she  can  show
    that she did submit her bank statement then her appeal succeeds because
    for the relevant period there was enough money in  the  bank  statement
    subject to the issue of consent.  If she cannot show that she submitted
    her mother's bank statement but rather it appears  that  she  submitted
    her own bank statement then her  appeal  fails  under  the  Immigration
    Rules as there would be insufficient funds.

29.  The Appellant's case now is that she has not had a bank account of  her
    own and that when she referred to a bank statement she was referring to
    her mother's bank statement.  I do not accept that explanation.  It  is
    quite clear from her application form that when faced with a choice  of
    whether she was submitting her own or her parent's bank  statement  she
    clearly ticked the box to indicate that she was submitting her own bank
    statement (at question M15).  Further in her witness statement  as  the
    Respondent pointed out she drew a distinction between her  own  account
    and her mother's account.  When she wrote  to  the  Respondent  shortly
    after lodging her application  submitting  a  bank  statement  with  an
    explanation why it was late, she  did  not  say  it  was  her  mother's
    account, she referred to it as hers.

30.  The burden of proof of showing that she submitted a bank  statement  to
    the Respondent rests upon the Appellant.  It is not for the  Respondent
    to prove a negative.  The burden is the usual civil standard of balance
    of probabilities but I find the Appellant  cannot  show  that  she  did
    submit her mother's bank statement.  Had her  covering  letter  clearly
    indicated that she  was  submitting  her  mother's  bank  statement  or
    indicated that she regarded her mother's account as the same as her own
    matters might have been  different  but  she  did  not  do  that.   The
    Appellant's denial of having a bank account of her own means  that  she
    does not disclose what bank statement she  actually  did  send  to  the
    Respondent. As I do not  accept  her  explanation  that  she  sent  her
    mother's account I have no evidence before me  that  demonstrates  that
    she was able to meet the financial criteria for  the  relevant  period.
    She does not contend that there was written permission from her  mother
    to say that the funds could be used. This  point  was  raised  for  the
    first time before me by the Respondent. In my view that is too late but
    in view of my findings I do not need to consider the issue.  The  claim
    under the Rules therefore fails.

31.  I therefore turn to the claim under Article 8. The Appellant  does  not
    claim to have a family life in this country.  Her claim is that she has
    a  private  life  by   reason   of   her   studies   which   would   be
    disproportionately interfered with by her removal.  In considering  the
    Appellant's claim under Article 8 I bear in  mind  the  step  by  step
    approached required by the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

32.  I find that the Appellant  has  established  a  private  life  in  this
    country by reason of her studies here.  Given that she is in the middle
    of a course at present  those  studies  would  be  interfered  with  by
    requiring her to return to Bangladesh.  The interference is pursuant to
    the legitimate aim of immigration control because the Appellant  cannot
    meet  the  Immigration  Rules  and  cannot  demonstrate  that  she  has
    sufficient funds.  The issue therefore is whether the interference with
    her private life is proportionate.  The Upper  Tribunal  have  recently
    considered the situation where someone claims  to  remain  outside  the
    Immigration Rules under Article 8 in the case of  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT
    00640.  There must be some compelling circumstances for a person to  be
    able to succeed in that situation.

33.   In the Upper Tribunal decision of MM it was  held  that  a  desire  to
    study was unlikely to be sufficient to engage Article 8.  In this  case
    the Appellant is part way through her studies but largely  because  she
    began the course substantially later than the date on  the  CAS.   That
    appears, she says, to be due to the delay by the  college  in  offering
    her a place.  Be that as it may, had she begun her studies at the  date
    indicated on the CAS she would now be less than four months  away  from
    completion.  Instead she has at least a year more  to  go.   I  do  not
    consider that that is a factor that weighs on the  Appellant's  favour,
    rather the reverse.  It was for the Appellant  to  sort  out  with  her
    college when she could start and given the muddle over her  finances  I
    do not accept that I  have  been  given  a  full  account  of  why  the
    Appellant started as late as she did.

34.  In any event, weight has to be  attached  to  the  public  interest  as
    expressed in the Immigration Rules.  The Appellant could not show  that
    she had sufficient funds of her own and she did not submit evidence  of
    her  mother's  funds  to  the  Respondent.   I  do  not  find  in   the
    circumstances that there is anything which is so compelling about  this
    case that exceptionally she should be granted leave to  remain  outside
    the Immigration Rules.  The Appellant can resume her  private  life  in
    Bangladesh upon her return where she has  spent  the  majority  of  her
    life. She does not have right to come to the United  Kingdom  to  study
    whatever the position may be in Bangladesh as to  the  availability  of
    courses there. Alternatively  she  can  if  she  wishes  make  a  fresh
    application for leave to remain  within  28  days  of  becoming  appeal
    rights exhausted and can then produce  further  evidence,  if  that  is
    available, to the Respondent.  She would not have  a  right  of  appeal
    against any subsequent refusal but that  of  itself  is  not  something
    which would engage Article 8.  I do not consider  that  there  was  any
    procedural unfairness in the way that the  Respondent  dealt  with  the
    application save that the dates for monies of January 2013 were clearly
    wrong, however, that defect was cured  by  enabling  the  Appellant  to
    appeal that aspect of the Judge's decision.  As  the  Appellant  cannot
    show any reason which engages the Human Rights Convention I dismiss the
    appeal on immigration grounds and human rights grounds.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law.  I have therefore set it aside and remade the  decision  by  dismissing
the  Appellant's  appeal  on  both  immigration  grounds  and  human  rights
grounds.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

As I have dismissed the appeal there can be no fee award.
