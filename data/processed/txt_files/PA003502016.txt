                                     And

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. On the 5th April 2017 the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Austin) was set aside by Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Harris.  Judge
    Harris adjourned the remaking of the appeal pending the promulgation of
    the Upper Tribunal's decision in the Libya country guidance case.


 2. The country guidance case of ZMM (Article 15(c)) Libya CG  [2017]  UKUT
    00263 (IAC) was published on the 29th June 2017. The material  guidance
    is:


         The  violence  in  Libya  has  reached  such  a  high  level   that
         substantial grounds  are  shown  for  believing  that  a  returning
         civilian would, solely on account of his presence on the  territory
         of that country or region, face a real risk of being subject  to  a
         threat to his life or person.


 3. On the 13th March 2018 I sent to the parties a  note  highlighting  the
    decision in ZMM and giving the following direction:
         "In light of that guidance  it  would  appear  that  the  Appellant
         should all succeed on Article 15(c) grounds.   Unless the  Tribunal
         receives, no later than 4pm on the 20th March 2017, submissions  to
         the contrary or a request for a further oral  hearing,  the  appeal
         will be allowed on that basis without a further hearing".

 4. No representations have been received  by  either  party.  I  therefore
    allow the appeal of the Appellant on the basis that her appeal succeeds
    on protection (humanitarian protection) grounds.
