                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. As was the case when I gave my Note of Hearing and Directions following
    the commencement of this hearing on 4 April 2018, this  is  technically
    the Secretary of State's appeal against a decision previously  made  by
    the First-tier Tribunal and so for ease  of  reference  I  shall  where
    necessary throughout this decision refer to the Secretary of State, who
    was the original respondent, as "the Secretary of State" and to AB, who
    was the original appellant, as "the claimant".

 2. This appeal has had a long history.  The claimant, who is a national of
    Sierra Leone who was born on 10 December 1986, was a child  soldier  in
    that country.  He had been forcibly recruited, along with his friend A,
    by the Revolutionary United Front the day  after  arriving  in  Maboka,
    after having run away from Freetown, where the claimant had been  born.
    It was (and remains) the claimant's case that after his father had died
    in 1994, he had suffered abuse from his family which was why he had run
    away, after his friend A had persuaded him to.

 3. In a decision made by Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun which was  promulgated
    on 7 September 2015 (to which reference will be made below) Judge Eshun
    at paragraph 4 referred to findings of fact which had  previously  been
    made by the First-tier Tribunal, which had not been challenged  by  the
    respondent.  At paragraph 6, Judge Eshun set out these findings insofar
    as it related to the claimant's activities as a child soldier:

         "6.  The [claimant] was made to take  drugs  and  to  kill  a  man.
             There  followed  a  significant  period  of  time   when   the
             [claimant] was with the RUF and carried out  significant  acts
             of brutality, killing and raping civilians.  In 1997 he  spent
             time as an assistant to Ibrahim Koroma  of  the  Armed  Forces
             Revolutionary Council.  He travelled to Guinea to try to  find
             his mother and then back to Sierra Leone to  rejoin  the  RUF.
             He was assaulted by his family again for his relationship with
             A and then fled to  Guinea  and  Senegal  and  was  eventually
             reunited with his mother in Gambia.  His mother came to the UK
             to claim asylum in 2001 and the [claimant] went back to Sierra
             Leone to live with an aunt.  He came to the UK in 2003".

 4. On 29 October 2003 the claimant was granted indefinite leave  to  enter
    the UK and he entered on 16 December of that  year  under  the  refugee
    family reunion provisions.

 5. It is the claimant's case that having  been  forcibly  recruited  as  a
    child soldier, he  was  supplied  by  his  abductors  with  heroin  and
    cocaine, the intention being that he  would  become  addicted/dependent
    upon these drugs.  This claim is consistent with  the  expert  evidence
    provided in the original expert report made by Mariama Conteh, dated 26
    May 2014, in which, when commenting on child soldiers in  Sierra  Leone
    generally, she states as follows:

         "20. As well as the nature of its brutality, another  major  factor
             that  brought  attention  of  Sierra  Leone's   war   to   the
             international community was the use and forceful  conscription
             of child soldiers, finally estimated at  around  5,000.   This
             figure excludes those  that  were  attached  to  the  fighting
             groups forcibly but with non-combative roles.  Just  over  ten
             years  after  the  end  of  the  war,   there   are   numerous
             testimonies, academic  studies  and  articles  available  that
             describe these experiences.   One  of  the  more  popular  and
             easily accessible accounts comes from Ishmael  Beah,  a  child
             soldier from Sierra Leone who was able to find his way to  the
             USA, get adopted and gain access to a university education.

         21.  Apart from actual soldiers, many young children were  used  as
             part of the forces to cook and clean or  carry  equipment  and
             other loads.  Young girls were often used as sex slaves.  What
             is clear from many accounts is that apart from the initial few
             months of the rebellion where there appeared to be a sense  of
             revolution against a corrupt government, the majority of child
             soldiers were forcibly recruited.  Many accounts described the
             forcing of children to commit  atrocities  against  their  own
             family or village members so that they would never be able  to
             return.  Other accounts described rebels killing  families  to
             achieve the same result.

         22.  During their  time  as  soldiers,  children  were  not  spared
             committing violent acts, fighting and  killing.   Their  roles
             were the same as older combatants.  There are also accounts of
             widespread drug use.  Drugs were used by commanders to  ensure
             that child soldiers fought  fearlessly  and  ferociously,  and
             also to the soldiers to deaden  their  emotions  and  distance
             themselves from the death and violence around them.

         23.  Not only were young fighters forced to kill, but  also,  aided
             by drugs they did so in a gruesome  manner.   Yet  seeing  and
             conducting this type of violence  became  a  regular  part  of
             their lives.  Ishmael Beah, a former  ex-combatant  who  wrote
             about  his  experiences,  explains  this  vividly  by  saying,
             'somebody being shot in front of  you,  or  yourself  shooting
             somebody became just like drinking a glass of water'.

         24.  Child soldiers as the adult combatants were accused of heinous
             crimes.  Not only did they murder civilians  indiscriminately,
             but often this was done in a brutal  way  -  'apart  from  the
             infamous  rituals   'amputation'   of   hands,   and   summary
             executions, child soldiers sometimes cut open the  bellies  of
             pregnant women just to see what sex the child was'".

 6.  Regrettably,  but  perhaps  unsurprisingly   given   this   claimant's
    background, after arriving in this country he soon  fell  foul  of  the
    authorities.  In her decision referred to above, Judge Eshun  noted  as
    follows, at paragraph 4:

         "He was convicted of various public order, theft,  criminal  damage
         and common assault offences between 2006 and  2011,  the  sentences
         included two short custodial terms.  [Then] on 10  August  2012  he
         was convicted at Exeter Crown Court of possessing a controlled drug
         with intent to supply and received a three year custodial  sentence
         with a consecutive twelve  month  sentence  for  possession  of  an
         offensive weapon; making four years in all".

 7. In his original witness statement, made  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing (to which reference will be made below) on  2  June  2014,  the
    claimant set out the circumstances in which the  most  serious  offence
    was committed:

         "3.  My father was a successful businessman.  I was very  close  to
             him  before  he  died  and  I  remember  him  telling  me  the
             importance of education and working hard in school.   My  life
             would have been very different if he had not died when  I  was
             so young and if I had not been convinced  by  A  to  leave  my
             family.  I was very young and didn't really know  what  I  was
             doing, so when he suggested that we leave, I followed him.

         4.   As I mentioned in my asylum statement ... I was about 10 years
             old when I was captured and  recruited  by  the  Revolutionary
             United Front (RUF) in Maboka.  I was fed hard drugs  including
             heroin and cocaine which was supposed to  make  me  brave  and
             willing to fight for them.  Getting high like this was a daily
             occurrence  and  I  became  addicted.   It  stopped  me   from
             understanding what I was doing.  I have been  struggling  with
             this addiction since coming to the UK in 2003.  I  have  tried
             to stop before and have been successful at times but  I  ended
             up just swapping between different drugs.  I could not  afford
             the drugs that I was taking and, I started owing a drug dealer
             called Yousef money in 2006.  This step was the reason I  went
             to Glasgow; in order to get a job to pay it off.

         5.   On another occasion in about 2008 or 2009 while we were living
             in Peckham, I was beaten up by Yousef's guys  in  Burgess.   I
             was also pulled into a van and beaten up a couple of times  by
             about six guys in Lewisham  in  around  2011.   This  was  all
             because I owed Yousef money but I  kept  telling  him  that  I
             could not pay.

         6.   Yousef and the men who worked for  him  have  attacked  me  on
             several occasions because of this debt.  When I was living  in
             Catford with A, they came to our home while we were out, broke
             in and took things like a laptop and a Nintendo Wii.   A  told
             the police about this.

         7.   I started sleeping at my cousin's (MLK) house at  [~]  Street,
             in around May 2012 until June 2012.  This is  because  I  felt
             that it was not safe for my children if I was  ...  living  in
             the same house.  I knew that they were  dangerous  people  and
             did not want my girls to be anywhere near that.

         8.   Two months before my arrest, I bumped into  some  of  Yousef's
             people in Old Kent Road.  They told me that I should transport
             some drugs for them to pay  off  the  debt.   They  said  that
             because I had owed them �4,000 for so long, I  now  owed  them
             �10,000.  They said that  I  could  pay  this  off  by  making
             deliveries for them.  I felt that I had no choice  but  to  do
             this because they will keep threatening me and my family if  I
             refuse.".

 8.  Following  the  claimant's  conviction  at  Exeter  Crown  Court   for
    possessing a controlled drug  with  intent  to  supply,  for  which  he
    received a three year custodial sentence together  with  a  consecutive
    twelve months' sentence for possession  of  an  offensive  weapon,  the
    Secretary of State  made  a  decision  to  deport  him.   The  claimant
    appealed against this decision and his appeal was allowed by the First-
    tier Tribunal.  On 18 June 2015 the Upper Tribunal, consisting of Upper
    Tribunal Judges Eshun and  Blum,  had  found  that  that  decision  had
    contained a material error of law such that it would have to be remade.
     As Judge Eshun notes in her decision already referred to, at paragraph
    2:

         "The errors identified by the Upper Tribunal were that  the  First-
         tier Tribunal failed to refer to the Rules as then in place,  erred
         in considering the case on the basis of Article 8 outside the Rules
         and failed to explain its conclusions".

 9. This decision was then remade by Judge Eshun in the decision from which
    I have quoted above and, following a  hearing  at  Field  House  on  18
    August 2015, in a Decision and Reasons promulgated on 7 September 2015,
    Judge Eshun allowed the claimant's appeal.

10. At that time, the claimant was in a subsisting  relationship  with  one
    AE, whom the claimant had met when she was 16, and the couple  had  two
    children, born in 2005 and 2009.  As Judge Eshun records at paragraph 7
    of her decision:

         "The [Secretary of State] has accepted that there is a genuine  and
         subsisting parental relationship between  the  [claimant]  and  the
         children and that it is not reasonable for the  children  to  leave
         the UK.  The [Secretary of State] also accepted that the [claimant]
         is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with AE, a  citizen  of
         Jamaica, who was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK".

11. In her decision, Judge Eshun had regard to the  relevant  Rules,  being
    398, 399 and 399A,  and  also  to  Section  117C  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (inserted by the 2014 Immigration Act).



12. At the time Judge Eshun made  her  decision,  this  Tribunal  had  just
    promulgated its decision in MAB (para 399; "unduly harsh")  USA  [2015]
    UKUT 435, where, as Judge Eshun notes at paragraph 21 of her  decision,
    "The Tribunal rejected the submission of the SSHD that  'unduly  harsh'
    implied a need to factor in the public interest".  She cited  what  the
    Tribunal in MAB had  found  at  paragraph  72,  of  that  decision,  as
    follows:

         "'Unduly' requires that the impact upon the individual concerned be
         'inordinately' harsh.  By that we mean that  the  impact  would  be
         'unusually large' or 'excessive'.  We do not intend that  to  be  a
         definition but rather a 'gloss' to assist decision makers  applying
         para 399, indeed, s. 117C(5).  [The assessment] is necessarily fact-
         sensitive but is focused upon the impact on the individual (whether
         child or partner) concerned".

13. Subsequently a differently  constituted  Tribunal  (UTJ  Southern)  had
    declined to follow MAB but had found, in  KMO  (section  117  -  unduly
    harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543 that when considering whether  or  not
    it was "unduly harsh" to require a child in the UK  to  remain  without
    the offending parent a Tribunal had to have regard to  the  criminality
    of the parent.  In other words, the decision of this  Tribunal  in  MAB
    was not to be followed.

14. Judge Southern's decision in KMO was upheld by the Court of  Appeal  in
    MM (Uganda) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 617.

15. The Secretary of State appealed against Judge Eshun's decision  on  the
    basis that she had been wrong to rely on the decision of this  Tribunal
    in MAB, and it was ordered by consent, in the Court of Appeal, that the
    appeal be:

         "remitted to the Upper Tribunal for reconsideration of whether  the
         effect on the [claimant's] children of  separating  them  from  the
         [claimant] by way of  the  latter's  deportation  would  be  unduly
         harsh".

16. The Statement of Reasons agreed by the parties, included the following:

         "7.  At [para] 28 and 31 of her decision in  this  case,  UT  Judge
             Eshun followed the decision in MAB [2015] UKUT  435  (IAC)  in
             finding that 'unduly harsh' did not imply a need to factor  in
             the public interest.  At [para] 72 of the Tribunal in MAB said
             that:

               'Unduly'  requires  that  the  impact  upon  the   individual
                  concerned be 'inordinately' harsh.  By that we  mean  that
                  the impact would be 'unusually large' or 'excessive'.   We
                  do not intend that to be a definition but rather a 'gloss'
                  to assist decision makers applying para  399,  indeed,  s.
                  117C(5).  [...]  [The  assessment]  is  necessarily  fact-
                  sensitive but is focused upon the impact on the individual
                  (whether child or partner) concerned.'

         8.   The UT in MAB went on to say that the earlier decisions of the
             UT - notably MK Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 00223  (IAC)  and  BM
             DRC CG [2015] UKUT 00293 (IAC) - had not involved a  balancing
             exercise and that, on the facts, '[i]t could not  properly  be
             established that the effect on [the  claimant's  children]  of
             the [claimant's]  deportation  was  excessive,  inordinate  or
             severe'.

         9.   It is now clear from the judgment in  MM  (Uganda)  that  that
             decision is wrong.  At  [26]  Laws  LJ,  with  whom  Voss  and
             Hamblen LJJ agreed,  expressly  held  that  MAB  was  'wrongly
             decided', and that, for reasons which he had set out at  [23]-
             [24]:

              'The expression 'unduly harsh' in  Section  117C(5)  and  Rule
                  399(a) and (b) requires  regard  to  be  had  to  all  the
                  circumstances including  the  criminal's  immigration  and
                  criminal history.'

         10.  The parties accordingly agree that Judge Eshun therefore erred
             in her approach to the 'unduly harsh' test.  They  also  agree
             that it is possible that the UT's  decision  would  have  been
             different if the judge had applied the  correct  test  to  the
             particular facts of the case.  Therefore the decision on  AB's
             substantive appeal against deportation should be  reconsidered
             by the UT before a judge other than Judge Eshun ...".

17. The appeal was then listed before the Upper Tribunal for directions  on
    23 January 2018.  Following that hearing, the directions recorded  that
    the parties had agreed that the issues to be  determined  would  be  as
    follows:

         "Whether the [claimant's] removal  from  the  United  Kingdom  will
         breach his Article 8 rights:-

         (a)  by reference to paragraph  399(a)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
             (having regard to the impact on the [claimant's]  children  of
             his removal from the UK);

         (b)  by reference to paragraph 399A of those Rules  (having  regard
             to the obstacles to the [claimant's] integration if returned);
             and/or

         (c)  by reference to very  compelling  circumstances  either  under
             paragraph 398  of  those  Rules  or  in  accordance  with  the
             guidance in Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60".

18. It was also recorded that the parties accepted that there had  been  no
    challenge to the findings of the First-tier  Tribunal  which  had  been
    made and set out in paragraphs  15  to  18  of  the  decision  of  that
    Tribunal promulgated on 6 August 2014.  Paragraphs 15  to  18  of  that
    decision (which have been summarised earlier) were as follows:

         "Our Findings of Fact and Law

         15.  We found the appellant  to  be  a  credible  witness  and  his
             account is consistent with  the  expert  report  ('the  expert
             report') from Mariama Conteh (appellant's bundle  2  pages  1-
             43).  His family members know very little about his role as  a
             child soldier.  We find that his account is reasonably  likely
             to be true and we make the following findings  of  fact.   The
             appellant was born in Freetown in 1986.  His mother  left  the
             family when he was very young.   He  went  to  live  with  his
             grandmother but when she died he returned  to  live  with  his
             father.  His father died in 1994 and  the  appellant  went  to
             live with an aunt.  He  became  friends  with  a  neighbouring
             teenager,  ABF  ['A'].   A  was  suspected  to  be  gay.   The
             appellant suffered  abuse  from  his  family  and  in  1996  A
             persuaded him to run away.  He travelled  to  Maboka  but  the
             town was overrun by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).  The
             appellant and A were recruited as child soldiers.

         16.  The appellant was made to take drugs and to kill a man.  There
             followed a significant period of time when the  appellant  was
             with the RUF and carried out significant  acts  of  brutality,
             killing and raping civilians.  In 1997 he spent some  time  as
             an  assistant  to  Ibrahim  Koroma   of   the   Armed   Forces
             Revolutionary Council.  He travelled to Guinea to try to  find
             his mother and then back to Sierra Leone to  rejoin  the  RUF.
             He was assaulted by his family again for his relationship with
             A and then fled to  Guinea  and  Senegal  and  was  eventually
             reunited with his mother in Gambia.  His mother came to the UK
             to claim asylum in 2001 and the appellant went back to  Sierra
             Leone to live with an aunt.  He came to the UK in 2003.

         17.  The appellant  met  AE  ('A')  in  2005  and  they  started  a
             relationship.  She was 16 and from  an  unsettled  background.
             She became pregnant and the couple had two children,  in  2005
             and 2009.  He has a number of other family members in the  UK,
             principally his mother, siblings and their children.  We  have
             seen an  expert  assessment  report  ('the  expert  assessment
             report') prepared by Peter  Horrocks,  an  independent  social
             worker, on 27 May 2014 (appellant's bundle  2,  pages  43-69).
             The report concludes that the appellant has  been  traumatised
             and severely emotionally damaged by the horrors  he  witnessed
             and took part in as a  child  in  Sierra  Leone.   He  took  a
             cocktail of drugs to cocoon himself from the realities of  his
             life and this has continued into  his  early  adulthood.   His
             emotional needs were not met  as  a  child.   There  has  been
             domestic violence in the relationship with A  but  the  couple
             appear to be maturing and are committed to each other and  the
             children.  They both grew up without fathers and do  not  want
             their daughters to experience the same thing.

         18.  The expert assessment report states that the appellant  was  a
             major figure in the lives of his daughters since birth and was
             their primary carer until he went to prison because A  was  at
             college and university.  There was a significant  impact  upon
             the children when the appellant went to  prison.   M  suffered
             from speech difficulties and L reverted to soiling and wetting
             herself.  The children have continued to have contact with the
             appellant and are excited at the prospect of his return  home.
             If the appellant were to be  permanently  separated  from  his
             children then this would in all likelihood have a major impact
             upon their well-being  and  development.   A  could  suffer  a
             deterioration of her mental health  difficulties  which  could
             undermine the functioning of a family unit.  We have carefully
             considered the expert assessment report as a  whole  and  find
             the conclusions to be credible".

19. It was also recorded within the directions that the claimant had sought
    to "reserve his position"  with  regard  to  amending  his  grounds  to
    include reliance on Article 3 of the ECHR.  It was recorded  that  this
    was subject to the  evidence  of  the  country  expert  and/or  further
    guidance given by the courts or Tribunal in relation to that issue.  It
    was also to be open to the claimant at any stage "to apply to amend the
    grounds of his challenge if he has evidence in support of that  and  it
    will be for the Tribunal for decide whether  to  grant  permission  for
    such amendment".

20. The appeal was then listed before me  for  hearing  on  4  April  2018.
    Regrettably, although the representatives of both parties had indicated
    at the directions hearing that in their view  at  least  one  full  day
    should be allocated for the hearing, only half-a-day was allocated.  In
    the event, the parties' time estimate proved to be more realistic  than
    that of the Tribunal, the result being that it was necessary to adjourn
    the hearing on 4 April 2018 part-heard, after the  evidence  which  was
    available on that day had been heard but before  submissions  had  been
    made.  The hearing was resumed on 13 June 2018  when  I  heard  further
    evidence from the claimant's mother, who had been  unable  (because  of
    her ill-health) to attend on 4 April, and I also heard  submissions  on
    behalf of both parties.

21. In addition to hearing evidence, at the  hearing  on  4  April  I  also
    granted leave to the claimant to  rely  on  Article  3  grounds,  which
    application was not opposed by the Secretary of State.   Having  regard
    in particular to the evidence which was now before the Tribunal  of  Dr
    Deborah Brooke, to which reference will be  made  below,  I  considered
    that it was clearly in the interests of justice to allow  the  claimant
    to rely on Article 3 grounds also.

The Hearing

22. The claimant's solicitors prepared a consolidated bundle in advance  of
    the hearing on 4 April consisting  of  two  lever  arch  files.   These
    contained new witness statements from the claimant, his sister, mother,
    and current partner (his relationship with AE now being at an  end)  as
    well as a very short  statement   from  the  claimant's  solicitor,  Mr
    Oldman, who confirmed that he had spoken  with  the  claimant's  former
    partner, AE, who had told him on the telephone that she would not agree
    to her children meeting with the  independent  social  worker  who  had
    prepared the earlier report of 27 May 2014 (relied upon in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal) to enable him to prepare a new report.

23. The bundle contained new expert reports from Dr  Brooke,  a  consultant
    psychiatrist, and Mariama Conteh, the country expert, an  extract  from
    whose original report of 26 May 2014  has  been  set  out  above.   The
    bundle also contained the witness statements which had previously  been
    served and also the expert evidence which had  previously  been  before
    the Tribunal.

24.  The  Tribunal  was  also  provided  with  documents  relevant  to  the
    claimant's current family situation.

25. At the hearing on 4 April I heard live evidence from the claimant,  his
    sister and current  partner,  who  were  all  available  to  be  cross-
    examined.  I was assisted by a  skeleton  argument  on  behalf  of  the
    claimant and before the hearing was resumed on 13 June, I was  provided
    also with a skeleton argument prepared on behalf of  the  Secretary  of
    State by Mr Kotas, which addressed the evidence which had been given at
    the previous hearing on 4 April.

26. At the resumed hearing on 13 June I heard  further  evidence  from  the
    claimant's mother, who had been too unwell to give evidence on 4 April,
    and I also heard lengthy submissions on behalf of both parties.

27. I will not set out below everything which was said during the course of
    the hearings, but  shall  refer  only  to  such  of  the  evidence  and
    submissions as is necessary for the purposes of this Decision.  I have,
    however, taken account of all the evidence and submissions, and all the
    material contained within the consolidated bundle, whether or  not  the
    same is referred to specifically below.

The Evidence

28. The first witness was the  claimant  himself,  who  described  how  his
    mother was currently in hospital with heart problems, and that he spent
    time with her.  He affirmed his statements, and that he  was  still  on
    occasion taking crack cocaine, although he had not had any for some six
    weeks.  He said he had been able to pay for it by small sums his mother
    or sister had given him or people in the bookies.  Regarding  his  most
    recent conviction for threatening and abusive  words,  he  had  pleaded
    guilty because he and his babies' mother were  "in  altercation";  they
    were arguing and the neighbours had called the police.   Regarding  his
    two convictions for failing to surrender to custody in  court,  on  one
    occasion he had been five or ten minutes late for court because he  had
    gone to the wrong court by mistake and on the second occasion no action
    was taken.

29. In cross-examination, the claimant confirmed that AE had now secured an
    injunction preventing him from seeing his children.  She was making  it
    very hard for him to see them.  He had not  understood  the  injunction
    properly, but he had only seen them three times since December.  He had
    two other children, one was in Germany and he did not  know  where  the
    other one was.

30. So far as his children with AE was concerned, she refused to let him in
    the house, so he would only be able to speak  to  them  for  a  minute.
    Effectively he would turn up to see his children but AE would  not  let
    him.

31. When describing his feelings about being unable to  see  his  children,
    the claimant said that although AE might not want him in her  life,  he
    "needed to be in his kids' lives".  He  then  said  that  he  was  more
    depressed than ever before, and added that "all this is my own  fault".
    His addiction had got him into prison and had got him to the  state  he
    was now together with his male pride.  It was his fault  that  she  had
    dumped him and that he did not see his children and  he  got  depressed
    about that.

32. The claimant accepted when giving evidence that he had to have a  drink
    every day, beer, cider or whatever he could afford.

33. In re-examination the claimant clarified what he meant  by  not  having
    smoked crack cocaine for six weeks;  he  had  occasionally  bought  �10
    worth once or twice within the past six weeks, but in his eyes that was
    not smoking.  Up to six weeks ago, he had been spending �20  to  �30  a
    day.  He would beg or borrow it.  Since then, he had only smoked �5  to
    �10 worth occasionally, maybe �20 in total, because he was "fighting it
    mentally".  The claimant then repeated that he was fed up with himself;
    "I am fit and healthy and living like this and my girlfriend says I  am
    a useless man".

34. The claimant still maintained however that he was a good role model for
    his current girlfriend's children, because  he  made  sure  that  those
    children did not see that side of him, although his current  girlfriend
    did know about it.

35. The claimant hoped that he could work in  construction  in  Elephant  &
    Castle, but he did not have proper papers.  He needed a passport  or  a
    biometric card, because he wanted to make something of  his  life.   He
    wanted to fix his life up, get a job and somewhere to stay so he  could
    look after his children.  In answer to a question from a Tribunal,  the
    claimant said he had not had a drink today, but the last time was  last
    night.

36. The claimant's sister gave evidence.  She relied on her  statement  and
    was cross-examined.  She tried to do her best to  assist  her  brother,
    even to the extent of telling the Tribunal that she had never seen  him
    under the influence of either drink or  drugs  when  he  was  with  her
    children.  She accepted however that it was certainly possible that  he
    had used money she had given him for drink, and she  accepted  that  he
    had a drink problem.  She said that her brother  was  upset  about  his
    current situation so he tried to block it out  through  drink,  if  not
    every day, then every other day.  She was not aware that he  had  taken
    drugs in the last few weeks.

37. Even though this witness was worried about the claimant's smoking drugs
    and heavy drinking, she still maintained that he was a good role  model
    for her children when they were around, and  that  he  took  this  very
    seriously.

38. When it was put  to  her  in  cross-examination  that  the  psychiatric
    reports indicated that the claimant drank every day and might have  his
    first drink at 8 or 9 in the morning, his sister said that she had  not
    seen that.

39. This witness was asked questions about whether any of  her  family  had
    returned to Sierra Leone since coming to the UK, to which  her  initial
    response was "not that I know  of",  but  on  further  questioning  she
    agreed that her mother might have, together with a younger sister;  she
    explained this apparent inconsistency  by  saying  that  she  had  been
    thinking about herself.  She was not aware  of  any  family  in  Sierra
    Leone.

40. When it was put to her that she had tried to paint  her  brother  in  a
    better light than he really was in, she replied  that  "he  is  a  good
    person and a good man" who "has been there for myself and my kids".

41. The claimant's current girlfriend, NK, adopted her statement.  In  that
    statement she described how  she  had  met  the  claimant  through  his
    sister, whom she had known for a very long time and that  the  claimant
    had started living with her at the end of 2015, having just  ended  his
    relationship with AE.  She says (which seems to be clear from  all  the
    evidence) that the  claimant  "is  not  very  stable".   She  says  (at
    paragraph 3) that "He feels hopeless and there  is  not  much  that  is
    keeping him going other than his children and nieces".  She states also
    how the claimant is currently unable to see  his  children  because  AE
    makes it very hard for him to do so.   At  paragraph  5,  she  says  as
    follows:

         "When [the claimant] is feeling low, he tends to turn to drink  and
         smoking crack.  He tells me that everything is too much for him and
         sometimes disappears for days on end.  I am there for him  to  talk
         to and I do what I can to help, and there are days when he is  able
         to give up the drinking and smoking.  But then things overwhelm him
         and he finds it hard to resist".

42. NK believes that she, his sister and his mother are "his only support".
     She believes he needs professional help with his mental health and his
    addiction problems.

43. NK believes that notwithstanding these problems the  claimant  is  good
    with her children, who are aged 14 and 11, because he has patience  and
    tolerance with them.  She believes he is hands-on with her children and
    is "a very positive influence" on them.  He also helps his mother a lot
    going to and from hospital with her.

44. At paragraph 9 NK says openly that "My relationship with [the claimant]
    is not easy and we have had our  ups  and  downs".   She  continues  as
    follows:

         "He sometimes says that he feels ashamed and like he is a burden on
         me because I am financially responsible  for  everything.  ...   He
         often does not have money even to catch buses so that makes  things
         very difficult.  This, as well as the immigration case, has  put  a
         lot of pressure on our relationship.  It has meant that  we  cannot
         make plans for our future or  even  know  what  could  happen  just
         months from now".

45. Having stated that it would have a  very  bad  impact  on  her  if  the
    claimant were to be deported, she then sets out what she  believes  the
    effect would be on him (at paragraph 11):

         "[The claimant] will not cope if he is sent back because  he  won't
         have anything to live for in Sierra Leone.  His biggest fear is his
         children growing up without knowing him and  him  not  seeing  them
         grow up.  He will be lost in Sierra Leone and I think it would push
         him to become suicidal.  Even here he gets to the  point  where  he
         talks about suicide at times, so to be in Sierra  Leone,  where  he
         knows no-one and is separated from his family and  children  -  his
         whole life - I think that would push him over the edge".

46. NK then says how she believes that  the  claimant  "is  a  really  good
    person and wants to be a provider, especially  for  the  children"  and
    that he "is a hard  worker"  but  that  his  immigration  position  has
    stopped him being able to work.  She believes that were he able to work
    this would help with his alcohol and addiction problem.

47. NK was not cross-examined and in answer to a question from the Tribunal
    she said that the claimant spent five days a week with her.

48. When asking supplementary questions, Mr Chirico told her that two other
    people had given evidence that the claimant spent a lot of time at  his
    sister's house as well, and so she was asked how many nights a week the
    claimant spent at her home, to which NK answered that he would stay  at
    his sister's and come to her, sometimes two nights  a  week,  sometimes
    three.  Sometimes she would stay with him even when this was not at her
    house.

49. Because an issue had arisen within the claimant's sister's evidence  as
    to whether or not the claimant's mother had visited Sierra  Leone,  and
    still  had  relatives  there,  before  the  hearing  on  13  June,  the
    claimant's mother had provided a further statement, and she was  cross-
    examined on that  statement.   Although  her  evidence  was  in  places
    confusing, it is not necessary for the purposes of this decision for me
    to set it out.   It is sufficient to record that having considered  her
    evidence very carefully, and also further  documentation  sent  to  the
    Tribunal after the hearing by the claimant's solicitors, I find that it
    is more likely than not that  this  claimant  does  not  now  have  any
    remaining family in Sierra Leone to whom he could look for support were
    he to be returned there.

Submissions

50. As already noted above, Mr Kotas had very helpfully prepared a skeleton
    argument prior to the hearing on 13 June summarising  his  submissions.
    He also made oral submissions at the  hearing.   Likewise,  Mr  Chirico
    relied upon his skeleton argument which he also expanded orally  during
    the course of the hearing on 13 June.  I do not propose to set out  the
    parties' respective arguments, but do take them into account within the
    discussion below.

Discussion

51. Matters have clearly moved on since the Court of  Appeal  hearing.   As
    Voss LJ makes clear in his reasons for granting permission  to  appeal,
    Judge Eshun's decision had been made  "before  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    decision in MM (Uganda) [2016] EWCA Civ 450 ... where the principles to
    be applied in this kind of case were laid down".

52. Voss LJ stated further that:

         "It seems  reasonably  clear  that  UTJ  Eshun  applied  the  wrong
         principles to the meaning of the words 'unduly  harsh'  in  Section
         117C(5) in paragraph 399 of the Immigration  Rules.   She  followed
         MAB (USA) [2015] UKUT 435 which is now no longer good law".

53. At the time of Judge Eshun's decision, the  claimant  was  believed  to
    have  a  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  his  children.    At
    paragraph 25 of her decision, UTJ Eshun had noted that:

         "the [Secretary of State] has accepted that the [claimant] was in a
         genuine and subsisting relationship with [M and L]  who  are  under
         the age of 18.  The [Secretary of State] also  considered  that  it
         would be unreasonable to expect [M  and  L]  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom".

54. Judge Eshun also noted that the Secretary of State  had  also  accepted
    that the claimant was in a genuine and subsisting relationship with AE,
    and that accordingly (at paragraph 27) "the issue therefore that I have
    to decide under the Immigration Rules is  whether  it  will  be  unduly
    harsh for the children and A ...  to  remain  in  the  UK  without  the
    [claimant]".

55. It was in the context of these relationships that Judge Eshun relied on
    the definition of the phrase "unduly harsh" in MAB.

56. The factual background has now changed.  Although  the  claimant  still
    wishes to see his children, it is clear that his contact with  them  is
    minimal, and he does not, in any meaningful  sense,  currently  have  a
    subsisting parental  relationship  with  them.   Nor  does  he  have  a
    subsisting relationship with AE.

57.  Further,  since  the  hearing,  but  before  this  decision  has  been
    promulgated  (although  I  obviously  was   not   addressed   on   this
    development), the Supreme Court in KO & Ors [2018]  UKSC  53,  has  now
    decided that MM (Uganda) was wrongly  decided.   However,  the  Supreme
    Court in KO  also made it very clear that the hurdle an applicant would
    have to overcome before establishing that the effect of deportation  on
    his or her child would be "unduly harsh" was a  very  high  one  indeed
    (see in particular at paragraph 35 of the decision in KO).

58. It is common ground that this Tribunal has to consider this  appeal  on
    the basis of the facts as they are now,  and  in  the  context  of  the
    current position, vis-�-vis the claimant and his children, exception  2
    set out within Section 117C of the 2002 Act  clearly  does  not  apply.
    Nor, having regard to the Supreme Court decision in KO, is it  arguable
    that the effect on NK of the claimant's deportation could be said to be
    "unduly harsh" either.

59. So far as exception 1 is concerned (set out at Section 117C(4)  of  the
    2002 Act) the claimant is not yet 32 and did not arrive in this country
    until after his 17th birthday.  Accordingly, he has not  been  lawfully
    resident in this country for "most of" his life, as is  required  under
    Section 117C(4)(a).  As  to  what  obstacles  there  would  be  to  his
    reintegration within Sierra Leone, this will be discussed below both in
    the context of whether a decision to deport him would on the  facts  of
    this case breach his  Article  3  rights  and  also,  when  considering
    Article 8, whether there are sufficiently compelling reasons  over  and
    above those set out within the exceptions why, exceptionally, he should
    not be deported, despite the considerable public interest in  deporting
    persons who commit serious criminal offences.

60. Although much of the evidence given  on  behalf  of  the  claimant  was
    confusing and some of it I found to be unreliable (in  particular  that
    of the claimant's sister where she attempted to downplay the extent  of
    the claimant's current dependence on crack cocaine and alcohol) I  have
    nonetheless found a number of aspects of the claimant's  case  entirely
    credible.

61. While the claimant currently still clearly has a serious  problem  with
    his drinking and also with regard to his drug taking, I accept that  he
    is at least trying to control these addictions.  I also  accept,  as  I
    have already noted above, that even though the evidence was  confusing,
    it is more likely than not that he does not have any  family  or  other
    contacts within Sierra Leone to whom he could turn for  support  if  he
    was deported to that country.

62. The situation with regard to the exploitation of child soldiers  within
    Sierra Leone and the effect this has had on  them  is  well-documented.
    Although one cannot necessarily exclude moral culpability on their part
    for the atrocities that they have inflicted on others, they  (and  this
    includes this claimant) are also victims.  The  moral  culpability  for
    the terrible crimes which the claimant and others like him committed is
    considerably mitigated by the circumstances in which their  lives  were
    ruined at a very young age.  One cannot easily condemn as wholly wicked
    a person who at the age of 10 or 11 is given a choice  between  killing
    someone or being killed, and the atrocities committed by  the  claimant
    and others in his position were against a  background  of  having  been
    fed, at an  extremely  young  age,  with  a  cocktail  of  drugs  which
    destroyed their moral compass.

63. It was clear to me from hearing the claimant give  evidence,  which  is
    reinforced by the evidence in particular of NK and also the psychiatric
    evidence to which I will refer below, that this claimant struggles with
    a feeling of worthlessness and also of moral culpability, for which  he
    is not alone responsible.  He did not before this Tribunal  attempt  to
    justify his behaviour and I believed he was sincere when  he  told  the
    Tribunal that he considered that the mess he was now  in  was  all  his
    fault.

64. It is within the context of these findings that I turn now to  consider
    what realistically is likely to occur should the claimant  be  returned
    to  Sierra  Leone.   With  regard  to  whether  there  will  be   "very
    significant obstacles" preventing  the  claimant's  integration  within
    Sierra Leone, were the claimant in a less precarious psychiatric state,
    there would probably not be.  Were he fit  and  able  and  not  feeling
    desperate, he has sufficient knowledge of what life is like  in  Sierra
    Leone, and I note that English is spoken as a main language  there,  to
    be able to survive adequately.

65. However, the claimant is not in such a condition.   I  have  regard  in
    particular to the very clear findings contained within  the  relatively
    recent report of Dr Deborah Brooke, dated 18 December  2017,  which  is
    thorough and detailed.  I note that at page 10 of her report  (page  77
    of the bundle) she states as follows:

         "In my opinion, [the claimant's] PTSD is complex because of his pre-
         existing developmental vulnerability, the young  age  at  which  he
         experienced  severe  and  repeated   traumatic   experiences,   the
         association  with  intoxication  (which  prevents  integration  and
         processing of experiences) and, most importantly his sense of guilt
         for his acts".

66. As I have indicated, this mirrors my own findings, and  reinforces  the
    view that I formed when hearing the claimant give evidence.

67. I also note what is said in the final paragraph at page 11 (page 78  of
    the bundle) with regard to the impact of removal of the  claimant  from
    the UK:

         "[The claimant] is a vulnerable  man.   His  removal  from  the  UK
         carries a clear risk of a recurrence of his depressive  illness  as
         he would lose the family integration  -  including  that  with  his
         mother and siblings - which he has been able  to  build  after  his
         extremely damaging childhood experiences".

68. Dr Brooke also has regard to the report  made  by  Mariama  Conteh,  to
    which I have also had regard in which she had stated that "At the  time
    of writing, there were no psychotherapy services in Sierra  Leone"  and
    that "She did not think that interventions, such as  counselling  would
    be available to him, and there were  no  services  to  address  suicide
    risk, to her knowledge" (this is at the top of page 12, page 79 of  the
    bundle).

69. Dr Brooke went on to conclude as follows:

         "I conclude that his removal to Sierra Leone would both prevent his
         access to any therapy for his PTSD  and  take  away  his  sense  of
         purpose  and  belonging  within  his  family.   Recurrence  of  his
         depression would be highly likely".

70. The real  force  of  Dr  Brooke's  report,  in  my  judgement,  is  her
    conclusion as to the potential suicide risk of the  claimant.   In  the
    middle of page 12 (page 79 of the bundle) Dr Brooke states  first  that
    "Suicide risk is difficult to predict and can  change  rapidly"  before
    continuing as follows:

         "[The claimant] disclosed in prison that he had taken overdoses  in
         the past.  At interview,  he  appeared  ambivalent.   He  described
         thoughts of killing himself, but he also thinks that  he  does  not
         want to quit.  He said that he injures himself by headbutting walls
         or punching walls 'just to feel the  pain'.   He  does  not  see  a
         future for himself.  He expressed hopelessness about  his  lack  of
         qualifications.  Nonetheless, on the day of my interview, I thought
         his risk of suicide was low because  he  is  in  contact  with  his
         family,  and  he  had  seen  his  children  two  weeks  before  our
         interview".

71. However, having noted the claimant's vulnerability  to  depression,  Dr
    Brooke goes on to consider the prognosis were this claimant now  to  be
    deported to Sierra Leone, at page 13 (page 80 of the bundle):

         "He would experience a process of removal, with a  possible  period
         in a detention centre, as a  reminder  of  his  last  imprisonment.
         This is highly likely to precipitate  another  depressive  illness.
         This will increase his risk of suicide, in my view, to high.

         On arrival in Sierra Leone, [the claimant] will be reminded of  the
         traumatic memories associated with his life there.  He has a number
         of fears relating to life in Sierra Leone, and very little in terms
         of happy memories to give him hope  that  a  life  there  might  be
         possible.  In my view, the cumulative losses  associated  with  his
         removal from the UK, plus exacerbation of his  traumatic  memories,
         will both act on his vulnerable mental state to escalate  his  risk
         of suicide to very high".

72. In other words, Dr Brooke's professional diagnosis,  following  a  very
    detailed and thorough examination and consideration of  the  claimant's
    circumstances and history, is that although the risk of suicide is  low
    should he remain in this country, it is  "very  high"  were  he  to  be
    returned to Sierra Leone.

73. I have to make a decision as to  whether,  having  considered  all  the
    evidence, including the medical evidence, in the round,  I  agree  with
    this diagnosis.  In my judgement, this  diagnosis  is  unsurprising  in
    light of the evidence which I heard and all the papers contained within
    the file, and I accordingly accept it as soundly based and reliable.

74. Accordingly, in light of what I find  to  be  the  very  high  risk  of
    suicide were the claimant now to be deported to Sierra  Leone,  I  must
    consider whether his deportation to that country would be in breach  of
    his Article 3 rights, having regard to the guidance given by the  Court
    of Appeal in J [2005] EWCA Civ 629, as  reinforced  by  the  subsequent
    judgment of the Court of Appeal in Y and Z (Sri Lanka) [2009] EWCA  Civ
    362.

75. Referring to the J tests, clearly the "severity of the treatment  which
    it is said that the applicant would suffer if removed"  is  severe,  as
    the real risk of suicide always is.  Secondly, there is, on  the  facts
    as I have found them to be, a clear causal link between the  very  real
    risk of suicide and the act of removal.   Thirdly,  acknowledging  that
    the Article 3 threshold is high because it is a foreign  case,  and  as
    the Court of Appeal in J indicated:

         "is even higher where the alleged  inhuman  treatment  is  not  the
         direct or indirect responsibility of the public authorities of  the
         receiving state, but results from some naturally occurring illness,
         whether physical or mental"

    notwithstanding that the threshold is high, on  the  facts  as  I  have
    found them to be this threshold  is  passed.   Fourthly,  in  light  in
    particular of the professional and thoroughly reasoned prognosis of  Dr
    Brooke, I consider the risk and fear of harm to  be  objectively  well-
    founded.  Fifthly, there is  a  real  linkage  between  the  claimant's
    mental state, which is felt likely to precipitate his suicide, and  the
    very serious ill-treatment he received as a very young child.  Sixthly,
    and finally, in light of Mariama Conteh's report, there do  not  appear
    to be effective mechanisms within Sierra Leone to reduce  the  risk  of
    suicide.  It is of particular importance in this case that  this  is  a
    factor which had been considered by Dr Brooke before she gave her  very
    depressing diagnosis.

76. Accordingly, although I have regard, as I must to the very large public
    interest in deporting foreign criminals, I consider that to deport this
    claimant now would be in breach of his Article 3 rights.

77. In light of this finding, I also find that the reasons  why  he  should
    not be deported (because if he was it would  be  very  likely  that  he
    would commit suicide, for a culmination of reasons which  includes  his
    ill-treatment within Sierra Leone)  are  sufficiently  compelling  that
    exceptionally he should also be allowed to remain on Article 8 grounds.
     Although the claimant as I have already found  above,  does  not  come
    within either of the exceptions set out within either  the  Immigration
    Rules or (which for practical purposes are the same)  Section  117C  of
    the 2002 Act, nonetheless the very high risk of his committing  suicide
    if returned is a sufficiently compelling reason as to outweigh the very
    great public interest in deporting him.

78. Accordingly therefore in summary  I  find  as  follows.   Although  the
    Secretary of State properly, on behalf of all those living lawfully  in
    the UK, seeks to rid this country of those foreign nationals  who  have
    committed serious drugs offences, on  the  exceptional  facts  of  this
    case, for article 8 purposes it would not be proportionate for  him  to
    do so, and it would also be in breach  of  this  claimant's  article  3
    rights. It follows that this appeal must yet again (but  for  different
    reasons) be allowed. under both Article 3 and Article 8.

Decision

The claimant's appeal is allowed, under Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court  directs  otherwise,  the  claimant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the claimant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply  with
this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
