Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Muquit of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh.  They appealed  against  the
    respondent's decision dated 24 November 2017 to refuse  them  leave  to
    remain as the partner and child of a British  citizen  on  the  grounds
    that the decision breached their Article  8  rights  to  a  family  and
    private life.

 2. Judge Young-Harry dismissed the appeals in a decision promulgated on 10
    August 2018.  The judge found that the public interest in maintaining a
    firm and fair immigration policy outweighed the appellants' family  and
    private life and that the respondent's decision was proportionate.

 3. The grounds claim the judge failed to have regard to s.117B(6)  of  the
    2002 Act.  At [28] the judge purported to have regard to the  same  but
    did  not  consider  whether  it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    qualifying British child to leave the UK.

 4. Judge Mailer granted permission on 1 October 2018 as follows:

         "2.  The  judge  found  that  the  appellant  committed  deceit  in
             obtaining her TOEIC certificate.  She has  two  minor  British
             children, aged 10 and 15.  They are free to remain in  the  UK
             with their father if the family so chooses, or can  return  to
             Bangladesh with their mother at a later date if  they  choose.
             Their best interests will be served  in  either  country  with
             either parent as has been the case over the years.  The public
             interest in maintaining a firm  and  fair  immigration  policy
             outweighs the appellants' family and private life.  The use of
             a  proxy  taker  carries  significant  weight  such  that   it
             outweighs any other consideration [29].

         3.   The grounds assert that the judge failed  to  have  regard  to
             s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act and has not  considered  whether  it
             would be reasonable to expect her qualifying British  children
             to leave the UK.  Section 117B(6) was a route available to her
             by which any public interest in refusing her leave was  to  be
             eliminated.  The  finding  that  it  was  reasonable  for  the
             qualifying children to leave the UK was deficient  and  failed
             to consider their interests as British citizens or the need to
             have proximity to both parents.  The respondent also failed to
             have regard to her own policy - SF and others (Guidance post-
             2014) [2017] UKUT 000120.

         It is arguable that the judge did not conduct a  proper  Article  8
         inquiry for the reasons set out in the grounds ... ...".

Submissions on Error of Law

 5. Mr Muquit relied upon the grounds.

 6. Mr Jarvis conceded a material error of law on the part  of  the  judge.
    The judge failed to engage with S.117B(6) notwithstanding his reference
    to the same at [26]-[28].

Notice of Decision

 7. Although not raised in the grounds, both KO (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53
    and  Rhuppiah  [2018]  UKSC  58  are  potentially  relevant  in   these
    particular circumstances.

 8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law, is set aside and will be re-made in the First-tier following a  de
    novo hearing.

    No anonymity direction is made.
