Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Haroon Khan, Sponsor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   In this appeal the  Appellant  is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondent is referred to as the claimant.

2.   The claimant, a national of Pakistan, date  of  birth  12  April  1993,
    appealed against the ECO's decision dated 27 February  2013  to  refuse
    entry clearance as a partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, with particular reference to paragraphs EC-P.1.1 and EC-P.1.3 of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

3.   That appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Sangha  who,  on  14
    March 2014, allowed the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds, but dismissed
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

4.   Permission to appeal that decision was given  by  Designated  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Dearden on 24 April 2014.

5.   The ECO's criticisms can be put very  shortly.   It  was  not  disputed
    that the claimant had not met the requirements of the Immigration Rules
    in failing to provide the documents and accordingly the application was
    properly refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1(b)  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Rules.

6.   Up to the  conclusion,  at  paragraph  18  of  the  determination,  the
    decision properly dealt with the issues faced on the evidence  and  the
    judge concluded that the application was properly refused  by  the  ECO
    and that the claimant could make a fresh application providing all  the
    specified documents as required under Appendix FM-SE.

7.   Where the judge erred was that he went straight on to consider  whether
    or not a case was made out under Article 8 of the ECHR because  he  did
    not perform the exercise identified in MF Nigeria [2013] EWCA Civ  1192
    and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and, in the light of  Gulshan  [2013]
    UKUT 640 (IAC) and other case law,   and  failed  to  consider  whether
    there  were  circumstances  which  were  not   addressed   within   the
    Immigration Rules, or whether there were compelling  circumstances  not
    recognised under the Rules which militated in favour of  an  Article 8
    ECHR assessment.

8.   It is correct that that is  what  the  judge,  although  ultimately  it
    makes a significant difference, concluded that there was evidence,  but
    failing to notice that it was post-decision and not in contemplation at
    the date of the ECO's decision. The Judge thought  the  later  evidence
    showed the Sponsor had earnings of �19,415 which exceeded the financial
    threshold of �18,600 per annum.  The  judge  evidently  made  an  error
    about the actual  earnings  because  the  relevant  tax  return,  which
    postdated the date of decision, even if he was entitled to take it into
    account, showed that  the 'gross turnover' of the business at the time,
    was �19,415.  However, after deductions and allowances, the net  profit
    was �10,209.  With further deductions, the profit from  self-employment
    upon which tax was to be taken off was �9,450.  Thus the  net  position
    was very different from that which the judge proceeded on and the judge
    made an error of fact amounting to an error of law  when  he  concluded
    that the claimant's evidence did meet the financial  threshold  of  the
    Rules.  Plainly the relevant evidence at the time, bearing in mind  the
    date of the ECO's decision, was not in being or contemplated.   In  the
    circumstances  the claimant  did  not  meet  and  could  not  meet  the
    requirements.. Similarly that the judge had no basis for what  was  the
    core of the reasoning for allowing the appeal under Article 8, even  if
    expressed in a limited fashion,  on the basis that the  ECO's  decision
    was a disproportionate  interference  with  family  life  rights  under
    Article 8(2).

9.   I find  the Original Tribunal made an error of  law  and  the  Original
    Tribunal's decision cannot stand.

10.  It is accepted that I should remake  the  case  on  the  basis  of  the
    material before me. I explained to the Sponsor why  it would be  better
    for him and the claimant to  make  a  fresh  application,  rather  than
    pursue what was a lost cause and have any further delay in  considering
    the present claim.  There plainly was no evidential basis, not least in
    the light of the decision in AAO (Somalia) [2011] EWCA Civ 840 [37-39],
    to show that the appeal would succeed under Article 8, when the  lawful
    operation  of  immigration  controls,  which  was   not   substantively
    challenged, was not said to be disproportionate to the legitimate  end.
     Quite simply all that had occurred, somewhat unfortunately,  was  that
    the relevant material had not been provided by the Appellant's sponsor.
     The issue raised by the judge in the  case  of  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900
    (Admin) really takes this matter no further, quite simply because there
    was no substituted figure given and, on the face of it, the  figure  of
    �18,600 financial threshold still stands: The judge made no findings in
    relation to any lesser amount in fact being appropriate.

 11.    Accordingly in remaking this  decision  I  find  that  the  position
    stood at the date of the ECO's  decision  that  the  claimant  had  not
    provided  the  relevant  information  as   required   which   met   the
    requirements of the Rule. It is not said that the necessary information
    could not be provided or that a fresh application  could  not  be  made
    which met the requirements of the rules. It followed that, on the  face
    of  it,  there  was  not  a  basis  of  exceptional  circumstances  for
    consideration of the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

12.  The ECO's appeal succeeds. The following decision is substituted.   The
    appeal of the Mrs Razaq against the ECO's decision of 27 February  2013
    is dismissed.
ANONYMITY ORDER
13.  No anonymity was requested and no anonymity  order  is  appropriate  or
    necessary.

FEE AWARD
14.  In these circumstances therefore the judge's decision in making  a  fee
    award against the ECO was driven by the  outcome  which  cannot  stand.
    Since the claimant's appeal has been dismissed, no costs order  may  be
    made.




Signed                                  Date 24 June 2014
