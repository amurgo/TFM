Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Edward Nicholson (Counsel instructed via direct
access)
For the Respondent:    Mr Ben Keith (Counsel instructed by the Government
                    Legal Department)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing their appeals against  the  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse the first Appellant's application
    for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant.  The sole issue before the First-tier Tribunal was whether the
    decision was contrary to the Equality Act 2010 because it was  racially
    discriminatory. The first Appellant is the  mother  of  the  second  to
    fourth Appellants, who are all children under the age of 18.  They join
    in her appeal as her dependents.  Since the first Appellant is the main
    Appellant in this appeal, I shall hereafter refer to her simply as "the
    Appellant", save where the context otherwise requires.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that the Appellants require anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 28 September 2016, the First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson gave his
    reasons for granting the Appellant permission to appeal the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Frazer dated 9 May 2016:

         2.   In summary, the Grounds, which are  lengthy,  argue  that  the
             Judge erred in law in the following manner:

               1) Ground 1, by failing to conclude that the  Respondent  had
                  demonstrated   discriminatory   treatment   towards    the
                  Appellants, by virtue of the fact  that  the  Respondent's
                  relevant guidance indicated that all Tier 1 applicants  of
                  Pakistani origin were to be  interviewed  in  relation  to
                  such applications, whereas no applicants applying  in  the
                  USA were interviewed in the same year in relation to  such
                  applications.  It is contended that, the Immigration Rules
                  being  universal  in  application,   such   approach   was
                  discriminatory.

               2) Ground 2 contends that the Judge failed to take account of
                  the requirements of [28] of the Rules, with  reference  to
                  her findings regarding Tier  1  applications  made  by  an
                  American,   a   Kosovan,   and   several   Afghani's   (as
                  particularised in [14-17] of the Grounds).

               3) Ground 3 argues that  the  Judge  arrived  at  a  specific
                  finding  without  evidence,  with  reference  to  a   non-
                  application  of  the  Respondent's   interview   streaming
                  matrix, there also being inconsistency  in  the  proffered
                  reason why that matrix was not been followed  ([18-20]  of
                  the Grounds);

               4) Ground 4 submits that the  Judge  relied  upon  irrelevant
                  statistics;

               5) Grounds 5 and 6 contend that the Judge acted perversely in
                  post-rationalising the basis for calling the Appellant for
                  interview.

 3. The Judge has produced a thorough and reasoned decision and has clearly
    spent a great deal of time in its production, for which she  is  to  be
    commended.  However,  the  issues  raised  within  the  Grounds  raised
    arguable errors of law.

Relevant background

 4. In June 2014 the Appellant applied for entry  clearance  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant, with her three children as her PBS  dependents.
    The application was supported by a letter dated 19 June 2014 addressing
    the point  scoring  requirements  of  the  relevant  Immigration  Rules
    relating to Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) applications.

 5. The Appellant was invited for interview on 23 July  2014,  and  on  the
    same day her application was refused.  The Respondent said he  was  not
    satisfied the application was genuine  as  he  was  not  satisfied  the
    Appellant had genuine access to the sum of �200,000, as this was  money
    provided by her brother.  The Respondent also noted that the  Appellant
    had only met her proposed business partner in March 2014, and there was
    no evidence as to what benefit,  if  any,  to  the  business  could  be
    attributed to the Appellant's input.  The  Appellant  had  no  business
    experience and she had had no input into the business  plan  which  had
    been provided with her application.

 6. The decision only attracted a limited right of appeal.  The  Appellants
    appealed on the basis that the decisions were contrary to  Section  19B
    of the Race Relations Act  1976,  and  also  on  the  ground  that  the
    decisions breached their human rights.

 7. Their appeals  first  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Maciel
    sitting in the First-tier Tribunal at Newport on 4 August 2015.   Judge
    Maciel dismissed the appeal on human rights grounds,  but  allowed  the
    appeal on the ground that the Appellant's case  on  discrimination  was
    made out.

 8. The Judge's reasoning was that there was indirect discrimination on the
    basis that the Appellant had had to fulfil the  additional  requirement
    of attending an interview, as a consequence of  the  RALON  report  for
    Islamabad.  The Judge found that the imposition  of  having  to  fulfil
    this additional requirement  of  attending  an  interview  tainted  the
    decision, and so breached the statute.

 9. The government legal department successfully appealed the  decision  of
    Judge Maciel.  Following a hearing at Field House on 2  December  2015,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Finch gave her reasons for finding that the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge had materially erred in law in her finding that the
    decision was in breach of the Equality Act 2010.  Judge Finch  accepted
    the submission of the representative for the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  not  reminded  herself  of  the
    relevant criteria contained in Sections 19 and 29 of the  Equality  Act
    2010, nor had she  considered  the  evidence  in  the  light  of  these
    criteria.  Judge Finch decided that  there  needed  to  be  a  complete
    rehearing of the case on alleged discrimination.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

10. The de novo hearing of the  appeals  took  place  before  Judge  Frazer
    sitting at Newport  on  25  April  2016.   Both  parties  were  legally
    represented.

11. In her subsequent decision, the Judge set out  in  paragraphs  [24]  to
    [37] the respective cases of the parties on the issues  of  direct  and
    indirect discrimination.  At paragraphs [38] to [51] the Judge made her
    findings of fact, and at paragraphs [52] onwards  the  Judge  gave  her
    conclusions.  At Paragraph [56] the Judge said that  she  accepted  the
    evidence of the Respondent that the interview streaming matrix has  not
    been applied at this time so as to require all  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    visa applicants to attend an interview.  This was borne out by the fact
    that 141  Pakistani  applicants  were  issued  with  visas  without  an
    interview.  She also found  that  the  notes  of  the  caseworker,  the
    interview notes and the Reasons for Refusal tended to suggest that  the
    Appellant was invited for interview on the basis of concerns  that  the
    officer had arising out of the application itself, "not because of  any
    general mandate".

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

12. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, the representatives  were  in  agreement  that  the  issue  to  be
    resolved was whether Judge Frazer had erred in law in finding that  the
    immigration decision under appeal was not vitiated by either direct  or
    indirect racial discrimination.  Aside from the  decision  itself,  the
    material which it was agreed that I needed to consider was as follows:

          a) The pleadings exchanged between the parties on  the  issue  of
             discrimination;

          b) The contents of the Appellant's bundle;

          c) The witness statement of Mr Nicholas Jariwalla dated 22  April
             2016 and its two exhibits;

          d) Mr Nicholson's outline written submissions before  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

13. I was informed that there were ongoing proceedings for judicial review.
     The judicial review claim had been dismissed by  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    but permission to appeal had been granted by the Court of Appeal.   The
    representatives were however  in  agreement  that  the  issues  in  the
    judicial review proceedings did not overlap with the  issue  raised  in
    the Appellant's statutory appeal, and so it was not necessary for me to
    see any documents relating to the judicial review proceedings.

14. Mr Nicholson developed the arguments advanced by him in  his  extensive
    application for permission to appeal.   Mr  Keith,  who  also  appeared
    below, replied briefly.  Although he did not agree with every  step  in
    the Judge's reasoning, he submitted that  she  had  reached  the  right
    result, and that she had given adequate reasons for finding against the
    Appellant.  Any errors in her reasoning were not material.

Discussion

15. The Respondent disclosed to the Appellant the RALON risk profile report
    and the interview streaming matrix for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) applicants
    in Islamabad which were operational when the Appellant applied in  June
    2014.

16. The interview streaming matrix for Islamabad indicates that the  policy
    which applied at this time was to  invite  all  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    applicants for an interview.

17. At the top of the RALON risk profile there  are  a  series  of  general
    comments, the first of which states that: "Pakistan remains the highest
    risk nationality for asylum".

18. In his witness statement, Mr Jariwalla indicates that the risk profiles
    are  used  as  a  guide  for  entry   clearance   staff,   highlighting
    applications which intelligence suggests pose a  heightened  risk,  and
    sometimes specifying additional  checks  that  should  be  carried  out
    before a decision is taken on an application.  The  risk  profiles  are
    created, and continue to be reviewed, based on  a  range  of  confirmed
    adverse activity data (such as overstaying, illegal working or criminal
    activity in the UK).

19. The Appellant's pleaded case before the First-tier  Tribunal  was  that
    this undisputed evidence disclosed direct race discrimination  contrary
    to Section 13(1) of the  Equality  Act  2010.   This  was  because  the
    selection of interview was determined  by  local  risk  profiles;  and,
    because of her nationality, the Appellant was treated  less  favourably
    than nationals of other countries where a selection for  interview  was
    not mandated  by  "the  relevant  RALON  risk  profiles  and  interview
    matrix".

20. Alternatively, the requirement for the Appellant to attend an interview
    due to her nationality  amounted  to  indirect  discrimination  on  the
    grounds of race contrary to Section 19(1) of the Equality Act 2010.

21. The  Respondent's  pleaded  response  to  the  pleaded  particulars  of
    discrimination was essentially two pronged.  The Respondent denied that
    the Appellant had been selected for interview due to  her  nationality.
    The policy on interviews was based on whether the application was  made
    in Islamabad, regardless  of  the  nationality  of  the  applicant  (my
    emphasis).  If the applicant had made her  application  in  the  United
    States, she would not  have  been  required  to  attend  an  interview,
    regardless of her nationality.  In any event, the policy was based on a
    range of confirmed adverse activity data (such as overstaying,  illegal
    working or criminal activity in the UK).

22. The second line of defence was that, in the event,  pressures  of  work
    meant that in practice the policy was not uniformly  applied  and  many
    Tier 1 applicants from Islamabad were not required to attend interview.
     The Appellant was required to attend an interview not because  of  the
    RALON profile or interview  matrix  but  because  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer identified the following weaknesses in her application:

          a) She had no previous work experience yet proposed to travel  to
             the UK to become the Director and Customs Relation Manager  of
             an accountancy business in which she would invest �200,000;

          b) There was no evidence of any connection between  her  and  the
             owner of the business in which she proposed to invest;

          c) There was no  evidence  as  to  where  she  would  obtain  the
             �200,000 investment.

23. Judge Frazer found that the policy inherent in the RALON  risk  profile
    report and  interview  matrix  was  not  discriminatory  and  that  the
    Appellant had not been discriminated against in practice. The Appellant
    was not a "victim" of the policy to interview all Tier I applicants  at
    the Islamabad post, as the judge accepted that the policy  was  not  in
    universal operation and she  accepted  that  the  policy  was  not  the
    trigger for the Appellant's interview - the trigger was the credibility
    issues raised by the Entry Clearance Officer in his case  notes,  which
    were set  out  verbatim  at  paragraph  3  of  Mr  Jariwalla's  witness
    statement.

24. Mr Nicholson submits that the judge was wrong to find  the  policy  was
    not inherently discriminatory. Paragraph 28 of  the  Immigration  Rules
    requires applicants to make their applications for entry  clearance  in
    the country in which they are living.   Accordingly,  in  practice  all
    Pakistani nationals must apply for entry clearance in  Pakistan,  where
    the  RALON  profile  required  that   they   should   be   interviewed.
    Conversely, applicants living in  the  USA  were  not  required  to  be
    interviewed. As the judge accepted that the requirement  to  attend  an
    interview constitutes less favourable  treatment,  she  ought  to  have
    found, he submits, that this was less favourable treatment was  due  to
    the nationality of the applicants at the Islamabad post  (predominantly
    Pakistani) and so discrimination on the basis of race was established.

25. I am not persuaded that Mr Nicholson has identified an error of law  in
    the judge's analysis, as distinct from seeking to re-argue the case  on
    the merits.  The judge correctly directed  herself  at  paragraph  [53]
    where she said that the  first  question  was  whether  the  Respondent
    treated the Appellant less favourably than she treated  or  would  have
    treated those who were not of Pakistani nationality: "This requires the
    choice of a comparator whose circumstances are the same as those of the
    First Appellant or not materially different."  It was open to the Judge
    to have regard to  Annex B which showed that  between  April  2014  and
    March 2016 nationals of Afghanistan, Kosovo and the  United  States  of
    America who applied as Tier I migrants at the Islamabad post were  also
    required to attend an interview:

         This would indicate that the Respondent was not treating  those  of
         Pakistani  origin  any  less  favourably  than   those   of   other
         nationalities.   Indeed,  the  table   shows   that   whereas   141
         applications were made by Pakistani nationals were  issued  without
         an interview, all applicants from other nationalities were required
         to attend an interview.

26. So I find that the judge has given adequate reasons for finding in  the
    Respondent's favour that the policy was not discriminatory, as  it  was
    not based on the nationality of the applicant, but  on  risk  profiling
    associated with the place of application.

27. The judge's principal conclusion was  that  the  policy  had  not  been
    applied to the appellant. Mr Nicholson makes the bold  submission  that
    the findings of fact which underpin this  conclusion  are  perverse  as
    they are not supported by any evidence.  This  is  not  the  case.  The
    findings of fact are based on the  witness  statement  evidence  of  Mr
    Jariwalla, as is clear from paragraph [44]:

         The upshot of Mr Jariwalla's evidence is that at that time that the
         Appellant made her application, the Entry Clearance  Officers  were
         not adhering to the requirement in the interview  streaming  matrix
         to invite the applicant for an  interview.   The  practice  was  an
         assessment of the applicant's circumstances  by  reference  to  the
         business plan submitted.  This is borne out by the  fact  that  141
         Pakistani nationals were  granted  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  visa
         without an interview in spite of the matrix.  That is to  say,  the
         requirement was not being applied in practice.

28. Mr Nicholson submits that the findings of the judge are contradicted by
    the Respondent's pleaded case in the judicial review  claim.  Mr  Keith
    accepts that in  the  pleadings  for  the  judicial  review  claim  the
    Respondent  told  the  Upper  Tribunal  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    interviewed because the relevant  RALON  risk  profiles  and  interview
    matrix stated that all Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  applications  should  be
    referred for interview.

29. Even so, the Respondent is not thereby estopped from taking a different
    position in the statutory appeal, relying on  the  evidence  which  has
    been provided by Mr Jariwalla for the statutory  appeal.   Furthermore,
    what is said in a pleading is not evidence.  It was clearly open to the
    judge to accept the evidence of Mr Jariwalla in preference to what  was
    pleaded in the parallel proceedings for judicial review.

30. The period over which 141 Pakistani applicants were issued  with  visas
    without an interview extends for two years from  April  2014  to  March
    2016, as shown in Annex B to Mr Jariwalla's statement.  Since the dates
    of successful applications without an interview are not  given,  it  is
    not clear from Annex B itself whether these grants  are  evenly  spread
    over the two years or, as surmised by Mr Nicholson,  only  arose  after
    the cessation of the policy later in 2014.

31. But the clear implication of Mr Jariwalla's witness statement  evidence
    is that the new practice replaced the old policy from April  2014,  and
    so it was not perverse of the judge to rely on the statistics in  Annex
    B as supporting Mr Jariwalla's assertion that the old  policy  was  not
    being applied at the time of the Appellant's application.

32. At paragraph [61] the Judge held that, having regard to the  caseworker
    notes, the interview record and the Reasons for Refusal:

         There was a clear evidence - based (my emphasis) rationale for  the
         refusal of the application.  There were issues with the credibility
         of the application which  led  the  officer  to  believe  that  the
         application was not genuine.

33. Mr Nicholson submits that the Judge has answered  the  wrong  question.
    He submits that the proper question for her to decide was whether there
    was a sound evidence-based rationale for the decision to interview  the
    Appellant.

34. I do not consider that the Judge has addressed the wrong question.   As
    this is a statutory appeal, the focus must be on the  legality  of  the
    immigration decision itself, rather  than  upon  the  legality  of  the
    process which lead to the decision. But even if I am wrong about  that,
    I consider that the judge's findings are sufficiently comprehensive  as
    to cover process as well as outcome. She has given adequate reasons for
    finding that the decision to invite the Appellant for interview did not
    constitute direct or indirect discrimination, and  that  the  resulting
    immigration decision is not thereby tainted.

Notice of decision

35. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error  of
    law, and accordingly the decision stands.  These appeals to  the  Upper
    Tribunal are dismissed.
