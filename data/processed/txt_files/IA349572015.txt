For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria  date  of  birth  19th  November
    1986.  On  the  28th  November  2016  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Brookfield) dismissed her appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to
    refuse to grant her confirmation of  a  permanent  right  of  residence
    under Regulation 10(5) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.  The  Appellant  was  granted  permission  to  appeal
    against the First-tier Tribunal's decision  on  the  28th  April  2017.
    Following a hearing on  the  14th  June  2017  the  decision  of  Judge
    Brookfield was set aside by consent.


 2. The matter in issue  in  this  appeal  is  whether  the  Appellant  has
    retained a right of residence as the family member of an  EEA  national
    following the dissolution of her marriage to Hungarian  national  Csaba
    Androvics. It is not in dispute that the couple had married in 2008 and
    that on the 12th January 2011 the Respondent had issued  the  Appellant
    with a five year residence permit on the basis  of  the  marriage.  The
    marriage broke down and the divorce was finalised on the  22nd  January
    2015. The Respondent refused to recognise any retained  rights  because
    she was not satisfied that the  Appellant's  former  husband  had  been
    exercising treaty rights at the date that the marriage was dissolved.

 3. The difficulty that the Appellant has found herself in is that her  ex-
    husband has refused to cooperate and provide details  of  his  economic
    activity at the date of divorce.  Judge Brookfield  had  dismissed  the
    appeal in the absence of such evidence, adopting the comments  of  Lord
    Justice Stanley Burnton in Amos v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2011] EWCA Civ 552 to the effect that the  proceedings  are
    essentially adversarial in nature and that  it  is  not  for  the  Home
    Office  to  make  applicants'  cases  for   them,   for   instance   by
    spontaneously checking the  HMRC  records  of  ex-husbands.   What  the
    Tribunal had not appreciated was that the Appellant had in fact sought,
    and had been granted, an Amos  direction.    Principle  Resident  Judge
    Martin had directed, as long ago as the 30th September  2016  that  the
    Respondent  conduct  that  very  enquiry.  This  direction   had   been
    overlooked by the Respondent so that when the matter came before  Judge
    Brookfield, it had not been complied with. It was on  this  basis  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was  found  to  be  flawed  for
    procedural unfairness and the matter set aside.

 4. When the matter came back before me on the 13th  September  2017  there
    had been some progress. The Respondent had been in touch with HMRC, and
    by way of a witness statement of an Officer of HMRC named  Roger  Drew,
    had produced evidence to show that there were no  self  assessment  tax
    records for  Mr Androvics, with national insurance number SK*******, in
    the years 2013-2014 or 2014-2015.  Nor were there any PAYE records.  He
    was registered as a self-employed gardener from 4th January  2016,  but
    that did not assist the Appellant, since the operative date as  far  as
    her appeal was concerned was the 22nd January 2015.

 5. Against this evidence, the Appellant relied on the following:

              i) A letter dated 27th September 2016 from Jonathan Abraham,
                 the director of 'Josam Services', a company based in
                 London. The Appellant explained that this was the company
                 that her ex-husband worked for when they were together.
                 She believes that it was an 'odd-job' service and that her
                 husband did jobs like painting and gardening. She
                 approached Mr Abrahams after the divorce and he agreed to
                 provide her with this letter. It states that he employed
                 Csaba Androvics from April 2012 to January 2015 and that
                 his closing salary was �420 per month.


             ii) Two payslips issued to Mr Androvics from 'Josam Services'
                 in January and February 2015.   The Appellant states that
                 her husband worked until the end of January and that the
                 February payslip reflects that. The payslips both indicate
                 that PAYE tax, and national insurance contributions were
                 deducted from Mr Androvic's salary.

            iii) A letter dated 3rd September 2016 from Coker Isah & Co, a
                 company who identify themselves as Chartered Certified
                 Accountants instructed by Mr J. Abrahams, who trades as
                 Josam Services. Because he is a sole trader the company is
                 not registered with Companies House but he is registered
                 for tax, and as an employer with HMRC. Coker Isah provide
                 his PAYE reference number. Appended to the letter is a P60
                 for Mr Androvics for the year dated 2013-2014. It shows his
                 employer to be Josam Services and his earnings to have been
                 �6300.   His NI number is recorded as SK********.

             iv) A further letter from Coker Isah dated 18th August 2018. It
                 is addressed to HMRC and was apparently written after the
                 Appellant brought the statement of Mr Drew to their
                 attention.  Coker Isah assert that Mr Abrahams did make
                 some PAYE payments in respect of his employee Mr Androvics,
                 and request confirmation of the same. Significantly Mr
                 Androvics details are recorded as follows: 'NINO
                 SK********* or Error one JP********". Attached is a
                 statement of Mr Abraham's PAYE liabilities which show that
                 he was at least paying PAYE, for someone, between November
                 2015 and January 2016.

              v) Coker Isah have further produced another P60 for Mr
                 Androvics, with the NI number JP*********, showing him to
                 have been working for Mr Abrahams in the year 2012-2013.


 6. The conflict in the evidence was difficult to resolve. On the one hand,
    the HMRC were saying that there are no records for any tax  being  paid
    for Mr Androvics in any capacity in the years 2013-2014 and  2014-2015,
    and on the other hand Mr Abrahams had written to confirm that he had in
    fact employed him  in  that  period;  a  firm  of  Chartered  Certified
    Accountants assert the same, and that they believe the PAYE tax to have
    been paid. A P60 has been produced at least in respect of the year 2013-
    2014. Mr Rashid made the good point that neither Mr Abrahams  or  Coker
    Isah have any obligation towards the Appellant, they have supplied  the
    information that they have in good faith  knowing  that  it  is  to  be
    brought before a court.  At the hearing  before  me  in  September  the
    parties agreed  that  one  possible  explanation  for  the  conflicting
    records could be the apparent use of two national insurance numbers for
    Mr Androvics. The parties agreed that  investigation  of  that  anomaly
    might resolve matters one way of the other and that it would be in  the
    interests of justice to adjourn the final determination of  the  appeal
    until further information could be obtained from the HMRC.  The  matter
    was therefore adjourned.


 7. On the 30th November 2017  the  hearing  was  resumed.  Each  side  had
    produced yet further conflicting evidence.

 8. Mr Harrison for the Respondent relied upon a further statement from  an
    HMRC officer, a Mr Matthew Anthony Jenkins, who had, upon request  from
    the Respondent, conducted a check  on  the  national  insurance  number
    JP**********. He was unable to  trace  any  records  relating  to  that
    national insurance number.

 9. For her part the Appellant had produced a  further  witness  statement,
    and an exhibit. The statement is dated  the  24th  November  2017.  The
    Appellant explained that she had been  unable  to  obtain  any  further
    information from Josam Services, or from  their  accountants.  She  had
    therefore tried to contact friends of her  ex-husband  from  when  they
    were married. She managed to speak to a man named Andreas who agreed to
    help her.   After a few days he called her to say that  he  had  spoken
    with her former husband who had agreed to call the HMRC for her. A  few
    days later she  received  to  her  address  a  letter  from  the  HMRC,
    addressed to her ex-husband. She spoke with  Andreas  who  assured  her
    that her ex-husband authorised her to open the letter.

10. The letter is dated the 2nd November 2017.  It states that in  the  tax
    year 2014 to 2015 Mr Androvics was  registered  as  self-employed.   It
    gives no detail as to whether he might have declared any income, but  a
    separate box does indicate that apart from one day of claiming  ESA  in
    October 2015 he had zero income declared.

11. Mr Rashid submitted that notwithstanding the HMRC records, the evidence
    established that Mr Andovics was economically active in  January  2015,
    and meets the requirements of Regulation  4(1)(b).   I  have  payslips,
    evidence from his former employer  and  evidence  from  the  employer's
    accountants to that effect. He further submits that I should take  into
    account the fact that the Respondent had previously recognised that  Mr
    Androvics was a qualified person; it is not in issue that the Appellant
    was previously granted a family permit as his spouse.  In  this  regard
    he relied on the decision  in  Samsam  (EEA:  revocation  and  retained
    rights) Syria [2011] UKUT 00165 (IAC) in which Blake J  indicated  that
    in the absence of evidence about a given  date  decision-makers  should
    look to evidence about surrounding  dates,  taking  into  account,  for
    instance, if there is evidence of economic activity prior to, and after
    the date of divorce.

12. Mr Harrison accepted that the evidence was ambiguous. Whilst there  was
    evidence to indicate that Mr Androvics was doing something  in  January
    2015 it was not clear what. The HMRC records said he was self-employed,
    and yet he had paid no tax. His employment records showed tax had  been
    deducted at source, 'PAYE', but again this was not reflected in the tax
    records.



    Discussion and Findings

13. There is a clear and striking discrepancy between the records  held  by
    HMRC, and those held by everyone else in this case. The  HMRC  have  Mr
    Androvics registered as self-employed on the day that he and  his  wife
    divorced, with no income declared. Josam  Services,  their  accountants
    Coker Isah and Mr Androvics himself appear to have believed him  to  be
    an employee, and that PAYE tax was paid on  his  behalf.  The  possible
    confusion that might have been caused by  his  having  two  NI  numbers
    remains unresolved.   The fact that no tax appears in fact to have been
    paid is certainly a matter weighing against  the  proposition  that  Mr
    Androvics was working at the time.

14. It is not however in dispute that the Appellant's then  husband  was  a
    'qualified person' prior to the date of divorce. He was  recognised  as
    such by  the  Respondent  and  the  Appellant  herself  was  granted  a
    residence card on that basis.  Looking at the evidence in the  round  I
    have little doubt that the Appellant's husband was still working as  an
    'odd-job' man for Josam Services in January 2015. I bear in  mind  that
    Mr Abrahams and his accountants Coker Isah had absolutely no obligation
    towards the Appellant, and had nothing to gain from supplying her  with
    the information that they did. They gave the information that they  did
    - including letters of confirmation, P60 and payslips - in good  faith.
    I have also found  the  Appellant  herself  to  be  a  wholly  credible
    witness, whose assertions about what her ex-husband was doing  at  that
    time are based on what she was told  by  mutual  friends.   I  note  in
    particular that Mr Androvic's P60  -  generated  by  Josam  Services  -
    showed him to have paid �1260 in tax in the year  to  April  2014,  and
    that his payslips are to the same effect in the following year.    That
    was obviously money deducted from his paypacket.  Whilst  I  accept  Mr
    Harrison's suggestion that public policy would require unlawful work to
    ordinarily be excluded for the purpose of  the  Regulations,  there  is
    nothing before me to suggest that the work that Mr Androvics was  doing
    - painting, decorating and gardening - was unlawful per se. He  appears
    to have undertaken it in good faith that tax  was  being  paid  on  his
    behalf.     I bear in mind that  tax  could  still  be  paid  on  those
    earnings.  Given those factors I  am satisfied that regardless  of  the
    efficiency of his employer or his employer's accountant,  Mr  Androvics
    was working at the date that he and the Appellant were divorced.


15. Mr Harrison was able to  indicate,  in  light  of  the  payslips,  bank
    statements etc that were supplied that  no  issue  is  taken  with  the
    Appellant's claim to have been working throughout the  relevant  period
    and to date.






    Decision


16.  The  appeal  is  allowed  with  reference  to  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  The Appellant has a retained right of residence.


17. There is no direction for anonymity.
