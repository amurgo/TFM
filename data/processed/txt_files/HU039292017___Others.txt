                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Brown instructed by Arshed & Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the Secretary of State as the respondent  and  to  the
    respondents as the appellants (as they appeared respectively before the
    First-tier Tribunal).  The appellants MS, SS and  AS  are  citizens  of
    Pakistan.  They were born respectively in 1978,  1987  and  2009.   The
    first and second appellants are husband  and  wife  and  they  are  the
    parents of the third appellant.  They appealed against the decision  of
    the respondent dated 20 January  2017  refusing  their  application  to
    remain in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds (Article 8  ECHR).
    They appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge R S Drake)  which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 6 September 2017, allowed the appeals on  human
    rights grounds.  The Secretary of State now appeals,  with  permission,
    to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The decision of Judge Drake contains a typographical error at [2].  The
    applications made by the appellants  which  are  the  subject  of  this
    appeal was submitted to the Secretary of State on 11 November 2016  and
    not 10 November 2015.  The third appellant was born on 12 July 2009  so
    had been continuously resident in the United Kingdom for  a  period  of
    seven years prior to the submission of the  application.   Mr  Diwnycz,
    who appeared for the Secretary of State, told me that grounds of appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal were inaccurate; the judge  had  acknowledged  at
    the time of the application the third appellant had reached seven years
    of continuous residence.  In the light of the true  facts,  Mr  Diwnycz
    told me that he would make no submissions on behalf of the Secretary of
    State.  I am aware that,  in  light  both  of  the  law  and  also  the
    respondent's own policy, none of the appellants  will  be  expected  to
    leave the  United  Kingdom  given  the  length  of  residence  achieved
    continuously by the third appellant.  Therefore,  whilst  acknowledging
    that  the  decision  of  Judge  Drake  is  in  parts  problematic,  the
    underlying law in this appeal is clear.  Accordingly, the Secretary  of
    State's appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

This appeal is dismissed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
