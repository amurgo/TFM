            DETERMINATION AND REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

Introduction

1.   The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal  with  permission  from  Mr
    Mark Davies, a judge of the First-tier  Tribunal,  granted  on  4  June
    2014.  Judge of First-tier Tribunal Wyman decided  on  6  May  2014  to
    allow his appeal on the grounds that the appellant met the requirements
    for the issue of a  residence  card  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").

2.   This is the respondent's appeal but I will  refer  to  the  parties  by
    their designations before the First-tier Tribunal  as  "appellant"  and
    "respondent" even though their roles are reversed before this Tribunal.

Background

3.   The appellant entered the UK on 23 January 2010 as a Tier  4  (General)
    Student with a visa valid between 26 December 2009 and 1 February 2011.
     On 19 January 2011 he sought further leave to remain ("FLTR")  on  the
    grounds that he wished to remain as a Tier 4 General Student.  This was
    granted for the period 18 February 2011 until 30  August  2012.   On  9
    August 2013 the appellant sought  a  residence  card  as  the  extended
    family member of an EEA national, namely Rajinder Singh Thind, a German
    national born on 20 March 1968.  The appellant claims that Mr Thind  is
    his uncle.

4.   The appellant, who is an Indian  national  born  on  1  May  1986,  was
    unsuccessful in his application and subsequently appealed  the  refusal
    which is dated 20 December 2013.  His appeal  notice  dated  2  January
    2014.  Unfortunately, my copy of the grounds of  appeal  is  blank  but
    according to paragraph  11  of  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the appellant claimed that he was dependent on his uncle, who
    had been working for Nijar Dairies Limited since 2003 and  was  present
    and settled within the UK.

Proceedings before the Upper Tribunal

5.    Following  the  hearing  on  23  April  2014  the  determination   was
    promulgated on 8 May 2014.  The respondent gave notice of appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal on 14 May 2014.  In her  grounds  she  points  out  that
    there were no money transfer slips,  no  letters  from  any  university
    stating that the sponsor paid the appellant's fees  or  even  a  letter
    from the sponsor's mother.   There  was  no  prior  dependency  by  the
    appellant on his sponsor whilst in India.   There  appeared  to  be  no
    adequate receipts for medical fees.  The evidential basis on which  the
    First-tier Tribunal had found there to be dependency in  India  on  the
    appellant's uncle was lacking and there was no credible explanation  to
    explain the gap in the documentation.  For these reasons the respondent
    was not satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of  the  2006
    Regulations and sought leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

6.   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Davies  gave  permission  because  the
    determination which had been promulgated showed  inconsistent  findings
    by the judge indicating that she had not  given  the  matter  her  most
    anxious scrutiny.  The grounds disclosed arguable errors of  law  which
    required consideration at a hearing before the Upper Tribunal.

7.   Standard directions were sent out indicating that  the  Upper  Tribunal
    would not  consider  evidence  which  was  not  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal unless it had specifically decided to admit such evidence.

The Hearing

8.   At the hearing I heard submissions  by  both  representatives  which  I
    kept a note of on the Record of Proceedings which is  attached  to  the
    Tribunal file.  The  issue  that  emerged  from  the  submissions  was:
    whether the appellant had  established  his  dependency  on  his  uncle
    whilst living in India?  Mr Whitwell began by explaining  that  if  the
    Immigration Judge wanted to accept oral  evidence  in  the  absence  of
    documentary evidence clear reasons should have been given for doing so.
      The  Immigration  Judge  had  observed  at  paragraph   51   of   her
    determination that it would  have  been  "extremely  helpful"  to  have
    received proper documentary evidence such as transfer slips  and  other
    documents.  However, this had not been received.  All  the  appellant's
    medical and university fees had apparently been paid from 2004-2007 but
    no documents had been supplied to confirm those facts.

9.   Ms Foster pointed out however that the dearth of documentary  evidence,
    although undisputed, did not undermine the appellant's essential  case.
    The appellant had been supported by his uncle in India in the  form  of
    medical treatment and assistance with his education.  The appellant and
    his sponsor, Mr Thind gave evidence.  There was also  medical  evidence
    about  the  appellant's  condition  which  tended  to  corroborate  his
    account.  The Immigration  Judge  had  not  said  that  documents  were
    essential for the appellant's case to succeed,  merely  that  it  would
    have been helpful to see such documents. It was also pointed  out  that
    the key issue raised by the refusal letter related to  the  continuance
    of the dependency not whether the dependency had existed in  the  first
    place.  The purpose  of  producing  a  bundle  of  documents  may  have
    included showing dependency as at the date  of  the  hearing.   In  any
    event, by the date of the hearing prior dependency of the appellant  on
    the sponsor was in issue.  The Immigration Judge had found that  up  to
    2006 the appellant's expenditure  had  been  met  by  his  uncle.   The
    appellant's serious medical condition had to be paid for by someone and
    it seems to have been paid for by his  uncle.   The  appellant  was  in
    essential need but it did not matter  that  he  had  derived  financial
    support from other sources as well.

10.  The respondent stated that the  Immigration  Judge  had  not  indicated
    that the absence of documentation represented no bar to  her  making  a
    reasoned decision.  On the contrary, paragraph 51 of her  determination
    appeared to indicate that those documents were potentially important.

11.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision as to whether  or  not
    there was a material error of law.



Discussion

12.  The appellant claims that he established  a  dependency  on  his  uncle
    whilst in India which continued in the UK.  Accordingly, he  relies  on
    paragraph 8(2) (c) of the 2006 Regulations as quoted in paragraph 14 of
    the determination.  I am  informed  that  the  version  quoted  in  the
    determination changed on 2 June 2011 but not in a material way.  In any
    event, the appellant has the burden of showing that he  has  joined  an
    EEA national in the UK and "continues to be dependent upon him ..."

13.  The principal criticism of the Immigration Judge is not  that  she  got
    the law wrong but that she was insufficiently critical in her  analysis
    of the evidence in reaching the conclusion that the appellant satisfied
    the requirements of Regulation 8.  The point is  also  taken  that  the
    Immigration Judge failed to give  adequate  reasons  for  her  decision
    against the respondent.

14.  At this point I observe that  the  Immigration  Judge  pointed  out  at
    paragraph 48 in her determination that the  respondent,  presumably  at
    the hearing, acknowledged that  there  was  a  dependency  between  the
    appellant and his EEA  uncle  in  the  UK.   This  is  at  first  sight
    surprising given  that  the  refusal  letter  dated  20  December  2013
    expressly  states  to  the  contrary.   Nevertheless,   assuming   this
    concession was made, the burden remained on the appellant to prove that
    he was dependent on the sponsor whilst he lived in India.

15.  According to the case of Barundi  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  40  the  Court  of
    Appeal pointed out that the absence of supporting evidence in this type
    of claim may be important when weighing up whether a dependency had  in
    fact been established.

16.  I bear in mind when considering the issue of dependency that  the  test
    for dependency under the 2006 Regulations is less onerous than would be
    the case were the application determined under the  Immigration  Rules,
    where an applicant must show that he is "wholly or mainly dependent" on
    the sponsor.

Conclusions

17.  Even after taking into account the less onerous test  for  "dependency"
    under the 2006 Regulations as contrasted with  the  Immigration  Rules,
    there appears to be an inadequate weighing up of the evidence  in  this
    case by the Immigration Judge before she reached  her  conclusion  that
    the respondent's decision to refuse  to  issue  a  residence  card  was
    contrary to the 2006 Regulations.  It appears that there was a complete
    lack of documentary evidence  supporting  any  dependency  between  the
    sponsor and the appellant  whilst  the  latter  lived  in  India.   The
    Immigration Judge found that the appellant had been  dependent  on  his
    father for a number of items up to the date of his death  in  2009.   I
    note that the appellant came to the UK in 2010,  although  he  did  not
    make the present application until 2013.  It seems from paragraph 51 of
    the determination that no documentary evidence was provided to  support
    any  expenditure,  including  that  on  university  fees  and   medical
    treatment (the items referred to at paragraph 53 of the determination).
     It would have been possible for the Immigration Judge to fill  in  the
    gaps left by the absence of documentary evidence on the  basis  of  the
    oral evidence.  It is a powerful point in the appellant's  favour  that
    there were two oral witnesses, the appellant and the sponsor.  However,
    there does not appear to have been any adequate analysis  of  the  oral
    evidence and I doubt that the oral evidence was sufficient to  fill  in
    these gaps.  The absence of detail is quite striking.

18.  It seems in the  end  that  the  Immigration  Judge  decided  the  case
    adversely to the respondent based on  assertions  rather  than  clearly
    analysing the evidence.  Had she done the latter she would  have  found
    that there was an absence of any  documentary  evidence  to  support  a
    dependency whilst the appellant lived in India.  The position may  have
    been otherwise whilst the appellant was living in the UK,  although  it
    seems that the documentary evidence supplied in relation to that period
    of residence was also unsatisfactory.  The Immigration Judge  did  find
    that the sponsor had travelled to India every year and had  given  �200
    to �300 to his Indian relations.  That is a fact-finding which  stands.
    However, this is insufficient by itself to support the conclusion  that
    the appellant was dependent on the sponsor whilst he  lived  in  India,
    particularly in view of the finding that the  appellant's  father  paid
    for many of the day-to-day items of the family whilst he was alive.

19.  For these reasons, I find that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    does contain a material error of law.

My Decision

20.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law so that it has to be set aside.  I substitute the decision of  this
    Tribunal which is that the  appeal  against  the  respondent's  adverse
    decision is dismissed.
