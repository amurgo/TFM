                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr A Finch, solicitor with Thompson & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

      (The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, rule 17, and
    The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005, rule 17)

1. The appellant, a citizen of the Democratic  People's  Republic  of  Korea
   (North Korea), appealed against  the  First-tier  Tribunal  determination
   dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision  to  set  removal
   directions to North Korea  or  Republic  of  Korea  (South  Korea)  after
   refusing refugee recognition, humanitarian protection or leave to  remain
   in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds.

2. At  the  hearing,  Mr  Norton  for  the  respondent  indicated  that  the
   Secretary of State wished to withdraw her opposition to  the  appellant's
   appeal and also her letter of refusal.  She  would  be  granting  refugee
   status to him.

3. That letter operates as a withdrawal of the  Secretary  of  State's  case
   before the Upper Tribunal and of her letter of refusal below, pursuant to
   rule 17 of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules and rule 17 of  the  First-
   tier Tribunal Procedure Rules, respectively.

4. On behalf of the Upper Tribunal, and in my capacity as  a  judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal, I consent to those withdrawals.

5. There  is  therefore  no  longer  an  outstanding  appeal  before  either
   Tribunal.

Signed
