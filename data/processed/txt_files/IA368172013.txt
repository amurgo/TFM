For the Appellant:     Mr Z Malik Counsel instructed by Mayfair Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS
The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 11 August 1990 and on 12
    June 12013 he applied for leave to  remain  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student further to Paragraph 245 of the Immigration Rules  HC
    395, as amended.

 2. He was first granted leave to enter the United Kingdom  on  29  October
    2009 as a student with a visa valid  to  31  January  2011  and  on  17
    February 2011 he was granted further leave as a student  until  23  May
    2013.

 3. He now applied for a visa to study at the European College  for  Higher
    Education for an extended  Diploma  in  Management  and  Organisational
    Strategy.  That application was refused on 31 July 2013.

 4.  The  respondent  stated  that  although  his  last   successful   visa
    application had been to study at Grafton College of Management Sciences
    he had supplied documents  in  support  of  his  application  from  DVC
    College confirming that he  had  studied  for  a  Diploma  in  Business
    Management from 14 March 2011 to 4 March 2013.  As he  was  subject  to
    Section 50 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  this
    prohibited him from studying at any  other  institution  that  the  CAS
    checking service records as his sponsor.  He had not complied with  the
    conditions attached to his leave to remain and his present  application
    was refused further to paragraph 322(3) of the Immigration  Rules.   He
    had not met the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(a).

 5. Further, he had failed to provide Pearson website access to the UKBA to
    view his English test score and it was not accepted he had provided the
    specified documents under Appendix A.   Although  he  had  provided  an
    immigration language test certificate from an approved English language
    test provider he had not provided the Person website access  to  verify
    the score and this document could not be accepted as  evidence  further
    to paragraph 245ZX(c).

 6. In addition it was not accepted the appellant had established  presence
    and he required to show he had the funds of ï¿½1,000 per month  for  nine
    months for  himself.   He  had  failed  to  provide  this  contrary  to
    paragraph 245ZX(d) with reference to paragraphs 1A and 11  of  Appendix
    C.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Mr K.St.J. Wiseman dismissed the  appellant's
    appeal both under the Immigration Rules and on  human  rights  grounds.
    He found at paragraph 35 the respondent offered no explanation for  the
    refusal on the basis of funds as to why the appellant was being treated
    as a person without an  established  presence.   He  appeared  to  have
    finished a single course of at least six months' long within  his  last
    period of entry clearance and nothing else appeared to be required.

 8. There was no challenge to the Judge's findings by the respondent  in  a
    Rule 24 response.

 9. Further, the judge found that in  relation  to  the  respondent  having
    access to the Pearson test results the appropriate  reference  was  not
    given in the refusal letter or even mentioned in the skeleton argument.
     It was the appellant's case that the respondent should have been  able
    to gain access to the appropriate information.  The judge accepted that
    there was no evidence at all that anyone on behalf  of  the  respondent
    even looked appropriately for the relevant information other  than  the
    assertion  in  the  refusal  letter.   The  judge  accepted  this   was
    insufficient and that he would not have dismissed the  appeal  on  this
    ground alone [38].

10. The judge turned to the submissions made in relation to Section  50  of
    the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  and  at  paragraph
    245ZW(c)(iv)(1) of the Immigration Rules.

11. The judge recorded at paragraph 41 that the appellant told him that  he
    studied for three days a week at the college in respect of which he was
    provided a CAS and for two days a week at  another  college  altogether
    following an entirely different  course;  he  may  have  had  the  best
    intentions in seeking some kind  of  double  qualification  but  "I  am
    afraid that this process failed utterly to produce  the  right  result"
    [41].

12. At paragraph 42 the judge rejected the notion that  the  appellant  had
    undertaken supplementary study and did not consider that:

         "Studying for three days in one college and two days in another can
         possibly lead to the  latter  being  described  as  'supplementary'
         only; it is a virtually equal division of time.  In  addition,  the
         guidance makes clear  that  the  supplementary  course  should  not
         interfere with the studies at the  primary  college  and  here  the
         appellant in this case falls down completely; he failed his studies
         at his main  college  to  the  extent  of  not  emerging  with  any
         qualification  at  all  and  somewhat  bizarrely   has   only   the
         qualification from is suggested supplementary college.  All of this
         shows very clearly is that his studies at the supplementary college
         for two days must by definition have significantly interfered  with
         his results at his  primary  college.   He  clearly  needed  to  be
         spending all his time studying his main course to succeed."

13. As such the judge found the appellant clearly breached the terms of his
    visa and the refusal under paragraph 322(3).

14. In the application for permission to appeal  it  was  argued  that  the
    judge  at  paragraph  43  of  his  determination  construed  the   term
    supplementary  studies  erroneously.   Applicants  are  not  bound   by
    mandatory requirements not set out in the Immigration  Rules.   It  was
    argued that further to the Immigration  (Leave  to  enter  and  remain)
    Order 2000 a condition should be endorsed on the appellant's  passport.
    The entry clearance must be endorsed with (a) the conditions  to  which
    it is subject; or (b)  a  statement  that  it  is  to  have  effect  as
    indefinite leave to enter the UK.  It was argued that  it  was  evident
    from the vignette endorsed on the appellant's  passport  there  was  no
    explicit requirement for him to study at a particular institute.

15. The requirement to study  at  a  specific  institute  as  at  paragraph
    245ZW(iv)  did  not  mean  that  the  condition  was  attached  to  the
    appellant's leave automatically.

16. Further, on a third and fourth ground, the judge failed to engage  with
    the argument on behalf of the appellant as to paragraph 322(3) being of
    a discretionary nature where the  respondent  had  failed  to  exercise
    discretion in this case Further to Ukus  (discretion  when  reviewable)
    [2012] UKUT 00307 (IAC).

17. A fifth ground challenged the approach to Article 8

18. At the hearing Mr Malik concentrated his argument on grounds three  and
    four of the application for permission and  requested  to  reserve  his
    position in relation to Section 50. He accepted that I would follow the
    decision in  Bhimani  (Student:  Switching  Institution:  Requirements)
    [2014] UKUT 00516 (IAC).  In effect where a student chooses to study at
    another institution holding a different  sponsor  licence  number  from
    that of the institution where he or she was granted leave to remain  to
    study, he is required to make a fresh application for leave to  remain.
    Judge Allen accepted that it was clear  from  Section  3(1)(c)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971 that a person given  limited  leave  to  enter  or
    remain in the UK may be given that leave subject  to  conditions  which
    include  the  provisions  inserted  by  Section  50  of  the   Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, that is a  condition  restricting
    his studies in the UK and in effect that entry clearance in the case of
    a Tier 4 (General)  Student  will  be  granted  subject  to  conditions
    including the requirement that the student  is  not  allowed  to  study
    except at the institution which  the  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies checking record service records as their sponsor.

19. However I also intend to follow paragraph 29 of Judge Allen's decision,
    that is the exercise of the discretion by the  Secretary  of  State  in
    relation to paragraph 322(3).  As was the case in Bhimani it  is  clear
    that from a reading of the decision letter in this particular  instance
    that it was the exercise  of  discretion  was  not  undertaken  and  in
    accordance with the guidance in Ukus, in particular paragraphs 22(1) of
    that decision there is a failure  by  the  Secretary  of  State  having
    properly concluded that the appellant was in breach of  the  conditions
    of his leave to appreciate that she had a discretion  to  exercise  and
    having so failed, failed to exercise it.

20. In the circumstance I do not address the challenge  with  reference  to
    Article 8.

21. The judge's decision allowing the appeal in full is set aside  and  the
    decision is re-made by a decision allowing it to  the  extent  that  it
    remains with the respondent to make a decision in accordance  with  the
    proper exercise of a discretion under paragraph 322(3) of HC 395.

22. Ms Holmes agreed with this course of action.

Notice of Decision

23. The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law and his  decision  is  set
    aside.  I remake the decision and allow the appeal to the  extent  that
    it awaits a lawful decision from the Secretary of State.

No anonymity direction is made.
