                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. By way of a letter dated 14 June 2016 the appellant has requested  that
    his case be treated as withdrawn by the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the appellant was the successful  party  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal,  and  that  the  respondent  has  challenged  that
    decision, I give such consent for the case to be withdrawn.

 3. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 4. The effect of the respondent's case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision, allowing the appellant's appeals, shall stand.


Signed                              Date:  14 June 2015
