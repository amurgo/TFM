For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Pakistan, date of birth 2  December  1971,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 18 February 2014,  to
    refuse her leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student with reference
    to paragraph 245ZX(ha) of the Immigration Rules HC 395 as amended  (the
    Rules).

2.   Her appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Callender  Smith  (the
    judge) who, on 8 October 2014, decided to refuse the appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

3.   Permission was given by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey on  19  March
    2015.  A Respondent's notice, dated 14 April 2015, supported the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's decision.

4.   I granted permission on one ground which related to a  claim  that  the
    Secretary of State had miscalculated the time spent by the Appellant as
    a student at level 7 with  reference  to  paragraph  245ZA(ha)  of  the
    Rules.  It was argued, as it  had  been  before  the  judge,  that  the
    Secretary of State had included periods of time over  and  above  those
    actually engaged by the Appellant in level 7 study.

5.   The judge in his determination set out the evidence received, which  it
    was apparent that he accepted, but he disagreed with the Appellant over
    the total time that the Appellant had spent in actually studying.   The
    judge identified the issue at paragraph 15 of the decision

         "The  difference  between  the  Respondent's   position   and   the
         Appellant's position lies in the difference between  granted  leave
         to study and the actual time spent studying."

6.   In evidence the Appellant recited the years (Y), months  (M)  and  days
    (D), and it is not challenged by Mr Nath, of periods of extended study.
     First, between 19 January  2009  and  April  2009  at  level  4  in  a
    Certificate in Business Studies; which is not  material.   Secondly  at
    level 7  between 21 September 2009 and 14 April 2010 (Y.O M6 D24) ,  15
    April 2010 and 30 June 2011 (Y. M2 D15), between 31 October 2011 and 15
    February 2013 (Y.O M6 D24) , and finally 16 June 2013 and  28  November
    2013 (Y.O M5 D12).  Those periods total three years six months and  six
    days.  Accordingly the Appellant said that the periods before and after
    periods of study  which  were  granted,  no  doubt  with  reference  to
    paragraph 245ZY  of  the  immigration  rules,  identified  the  periods
    granted when leave to remain existed: Covering a short period before  a
    course start and a period after the course ended.

7.   In the circumstances the grounds for first  time  when  renewed  before
    me, particularly relied upon paragraph 111 of version 4/14 for  Tier  4
    points-based students guidance produced by the respondent.

8.   Paragraph 111 stated

         "In calculating the maximum amount of time that you spend  studying
         at or above degree level, we will only include the length of course
         and will not take into account  the  additional  periods  of  leave
         granted before or  after  your  main  course  of  study  which  are
         referred to in the table at paragraph 98."

9.   Mr Nath's research as  much  as  mine  cannot  identify  any  table  at
    paragraph 98.  Paragraph 98 relates to a different issue.

10.  Careful consideration was given as to whether paragraph 98  was  to  be
    found in Appendix 6 for Tier 4 Students but it does not.   No  one  has
    been able to identify where the table in paragraph 98 was.  When I gave
    permission to appeal on  this  single  ground  I  identified  that  the
    Appellant would be required to establish that paragraphs 111 and 98  of
    version 4/14 Tier 4 guidance applied.  In  a  bundle  received  by  the
    Tribunal on or about 15 June 2016 extracts from  the  Tier  4  guidance
    were included but paragraph 98 and  any  table  was  not.   There  was,
    although I do not regard it as in any sense  binding,  a  summary  from
    the University of Warwick  which  was  undated  and  may  relate  to  a
    different  version  of  the  published  guidance,  which  stated   with
    reference  to  paragraph  245ZY  of  the  Immigration  Rules  that  the
    additional periods of leave granted before or after  the  course  start
    dates should not be include when  calculating  whether  a  student  has
    exceeded the  time  limit:   This  was  with  particular  reference  to
    calculating a five year time period for the purposes  of  degree  level
    courses.

11.  Since the judge did not challenge  or  reject  the  evidence  that  the
    Appellant adduced concerning her periods of study at level  7  and  the
    judge did not reject  the  course  level  it  seemed  to  me  that  the
    Appellant had raised now an  arguable point. For if one took the  three
    years six months and six days and added a period of fifteen months  and
    six days in the UK for the proposed final course  (Y1M3  D6),   at  the
    London School of Business  and  Accountancy,  the  total  period  still
    remained under five years in the actual periods of study.

12.  In  those  circumstances,  Mr  Nath  accepted  that  there  could  with
    reference to the guidance be an error of law by the Secretary of  State
    because the Notice of Immigration Decision had plainly included periods
    over and above that of the actual time spent at study on level 7.

13.  The grounds submitted with the additional  papers  contain  a  skeleton
    argument which has been drafted by it would seem by someone other  than
    the Appellant and raised a number of other issues.  Given the scope  of
    the permission granted I do not deal with them  save  to  say  that  no
    consent was given for those matters being argued.  The  case  of  Islam
    [2013] UKUT 00609 does not apply to the facts of this case.

14.  The Original Tribunal made an error of  law.    The  Original  Tribunal
    decision cannot stand.


Anonymity Order

15.  No  anonymity order is necessary or appropriate.



NOTICE OF DECISION

16.  The matter must  be  returned  to  await  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    determine in accordance with relevant published guidance,  the  periods
    of study and the claim under paragraph 245ZX(ha) of  the  Rules.    The
    appeal is allowed to the limited extent recited above.



Signed                                  Date 2 August 2015


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Davey
