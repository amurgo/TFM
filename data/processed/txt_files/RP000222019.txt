                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                  ABDUL [W]
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs F Farrell, of Peter G Farrell, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Parties are as above, but the rest of this decision refers to  them  as
    they were in the FtT.

 2. The  respondent's  decision   dated  20  February  2019  sets  out  the
    appellant's immigration and criminal history; finds that he has  failed
    to rebut the presumption under section 72 of the 2002 Act that  he  has
    been convicted of a particularly serious crime, and that his  continued
    presence in the UK constitutes a danger to the community; certifies his
    case under section 82(1); revokes his refugee status; finds that he can
    be returned to Somalia, consistently with country guidance; and refuses
    his protection and human rights claim.

 3. The appellant appealed to the FtT.  In a  decision  promulgated  on  24
    June 2019 FtT Judge Agnew concluded at  [31]  that  the  appellant  had
    rebutted the presumption that his asylum status should be  ceased,  and
    that he remained eligible for refugee status.

 4. The SSHD applied to the FtT for permission to appeal to  the  UT.   FtT
    Judge O'Garro refused permission on 17 July 2019, on the view that  the
    decision was in line with the recent case of A M A [2019]  UKUT  00011.
    The SSHD sought permission from the UT, relying on the previous grounds
    and further contending that the correct approach was to be found in the
    even more recent case of M S [2019] EWCA  Civ  1345.   UT  Judge  Kekic
    granted permission on 5 August 2019, on  the  view  that  arguably  the
    judge erred in failing to comply with country guidance in M O J  [2014]
    UKUT 00442.

 5. Mr Govan confirmed that the  appellants  rebuttal  of  the  presumption
    under section 72 is not in issue, and submitted further to the grounds,
    founding in particular on M O J and on M S.  He said that the situation
    has changed since the appellant was recognised as a  refugee  in  2003,
    and that members of the minority to which he belongs may now return  in
    adequate safety to Mogadishu.

 6. That may be so.  However, the grounds miss the point of  the  decision,
    which did not turn on any finding on the current safety  of  minorities
    in Mogadishu.  The reasons for allowing the appeal appear at [27 - 30].
     The judge founded upon the respondent's policy,  in  line  with  UNHCR
    guidelines, that  compelling  reasons  not  to  revoke  refugee  status
    include circumstances such as those to which  the  appellant  had  been
    subject, as accepted by  the  respondent.   She  found  that  exception
    sufficient to establish the appellant's case.  Mr Govan was  unable  to
    point to anything in the grounds which goes to that analysis.

 7. The grounds do not assert that the  essential  conclusion  of  the  FtT
    involved the making of any error on a point of  law,  so  its  decision
    shall stand.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
