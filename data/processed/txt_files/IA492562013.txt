Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Richardson, Counsel instructed by Morgan Mark
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born on the 29th  January  1975.
    He appeals with permission[1] the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge MR Oliver) to dismiss his appeal against a decision to refuse to
    vary his leave to remain and to remove  him  from  the  United  Kingdom
    pursuant to s47 of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor  on  the  13th
    August 2013. He then made an application  for  leave  to  remain  under
    Appendix FM/Article 8.  He  submitted  that  he  was  in  a  subsisting
    relationship with a  British  national  and  that  they  have  a  child
    together who had, at the  date  of  application,  indefinite  leave  to
    remain.

 3. By the date of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  couple
    had had anther child,  and  both  children  had  been  granted  British
    nationality.   The  Appellant  also  claimed   to   have   a   parental
    relationship with his partner's child from an earlier relationship.  It
    was submitted that he was presently caring for the children whilst  she
    worked, and that he had been offered work himself.  The  younger  child
    had complex health problems, suffering from a haematological disorder.

 4. Judge Oliver notes at the outset of his reasoning that it  was  "common
    ground" that the Appellant could  not  succeed  under  the  Immigration
    Rules. Although it is not expressly explained why, it would appear from
    the refusal notice that the Appellant had failed  to  supply  specified
    evidence in respect of funds, and because he was a visitor he could not
    satisfy the 'eligibility' requirements under Appendix FM.

 5. In proceeding to consider Article 8 'outside of the Rules' the Tribunal
    noted that the eldest child had been  conceived  when  the  Appellant's
    partner had visited him in Nigeria. The child had been born in  the  UK
    in May 2008 and the Appellant had thereafter become a "part-time  Dad",
    seeing his son only on visits. The Tribunal considered that the  family
    life could be maintained in the same way. There was  no  need  for  the
    British partner or children to relocate to Nigeria. The Appellant could
    carry on making lengthy visits as he had done between  2008  and  2013.
    Although the "strongest" factor was the best interests of the children,
    there  was  no  need  for  any  of  them  to  leave  the  country.  The
    determination then says this:

         "I accept that for the children, viewed at the date of hearing, the
         appellant has been a big presence in their lives. Quite apart  from
         earlier visits the oldest child has spent the  last  fifth  of  his
         life with a present father, while the youngest child has spent  all
         but 3ï¿½ months of his life with a present father..."

 6. The Judge goes on to remind himself that the Appellant did not meet the
    requirements of the rules and that the Appellant  could  not  therefore
    call upon Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.  There is a strong public  interest
    in removing persons who do not qualify for leave to  remain  under  the
    Rules.   In conclusion he states: "I accept that the appellant does not
    suffer from a consideration of paragraph 117B of the rules, but in  all
    the circumstances I find that the public interest in the maintenance of
    a firm but fair immigration control outweighs the family life interests
    of the appellant and his family. I am not satisfied that  it  has  been
    shown that the best  interests  of  the  children  are  served  by  the
    appellant's continued presence in the United Kingdom, but in any  event
    this is not  a  "trump  card"  when  considered  alongside  the  public
    interest". The appeal is thereby dismissed.

 7. The sole ground upon which permission has been granted is  the  alleged
    failure of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  engage  with  the  mandatory
    considerations in s117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002, and in particular with s117B(6).

    Error of Law

 8. Although this  determination  refers  to  s117B  there  is,  Mr  Tarlow
    accepts, a failure to engage with the provisions therein.  Although  it
    might be said that the Appellant could not hope to  gain  any  positive
    weight from factors such as his ability to speak English, there had not
    been a proper consideration of whether, pursuant to s117B(6), it  would
    be "reasonable" to expect his British children to leave the  UK.   Nor,
    Mr Tarlow contended, had there been a proper consideration  of  whether
    the Appellant had a "genuine and subsisting parental relationship" with
    them; he was not prepared to concede that  the  phrase  "big  presence"
    denoted such an Article 8 family life.  Overall  the  parties  were  in
    agreement that these omissions meant that  the  decision  must  be  set
    aside to be remade.

    The Re-Made Decision

 9. I accept and find as fact that the Appellant shares a family life  with
    his partner and two children. However it may be characterised  when  he
    was a "part-time Dad" he has been living with  them  in  the  UK  since
    August 2013.  I find that his removal would interfere with that  family
    life and that Article 8 would be engaged.

10. I find that the decision to remove  persons,  such  as  the  Appellant,
    without any leave to remain in the UK is a measure rationally connected
    to the legitimate Article 8(2) aim of 'protection of the  economy'  and
    that the Secretary of State  has the  power  in  law  to  take  such  a
    decision.

11. In addressing whether or not the decision is proportionate I must  have
    regard to those factors set out in s117:

         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
         the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)      Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)      Little weight should be given to a private life
         established by a person at a time when the person's immigration
         status is precarious.

         (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
         the public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
             the United Kingdom.

12. I remind myself that the maintenance of effective  immigration  control
    is in the public interest. The Appellant has not, as far as I have been
    made aware, remained in the UK without leave[2]  but he currently seeks
    leave to remain in a category that is not eligible for: to that  extent
    the decision to remove him is in the public interest.

13. The Appellant speaks fluent English. He is financially  self-sufficient
    in that he and his partner do not claim any public funds. She runs  her
    own business and he looks after the children to enable her  to  do  so.
    These are not factors that can weigh against him.

14.  Sub-paragraph  (4)  does  not  apply  to  the  Appellant   since   his
    relationship with a qualifying partner was formed in  Nigeria.  He  has
    never been here unlawfully. Nor does (5) since  the  Appellant  is  not
    relying on the private life he might have established  since  his  last
    entry.

15. The crux of the matter, as identified at error of law stage, is whether
    the public interest requires the Appellant's removal at all.  I find as
    fact that he has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with
    two qualifying children. Both his children are British  citizens.  They
    have always known him as their father and notwithstanding the fact that
    he could only spend limited time with them prior to 2013  he  has  been
    considered to be part of their family lives.  He has lived  permanently
    with them since August 2013.   He contributes to their day to day care.
    He takes them to the park, and to doctor's appointments. He  feeds  and
    bathes them.   He is their  father.  The  question  is  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect them to leave the UK.

16. Mr Richardson points to current Home Office policy to submit that it is
    not. In Sanade and Ors (British Children - Zambrano  -  Dereci)  [2012]
    UKUT 00048 (IAC) the Respondent made  a  concession,  approved  by  the
    Tribunal, which still features in the current guidance to  case-owners.
    The relevant paragraphs of Sanade appear at paragraph 93 on:

         93.      Finally, we note that a further question on which we asked
         for the respondent's assistance was in these terms:

             "Does the respondent agree that in a case where a non-national
             parent is being removed and claims it is a violation  of  that
             person's human rights to be separated from a child  with  whom
             he presently enjoys family life as an engaged parent,  that  a
             consequence of the CJEU's judgment is that it is not  open  to
             the respondent to submit that an interference can  be  avoided
             because it is reasonable to expect the child  (and  presumably
             any other parent/carer who is not facing  deportation/removal)
             to join the appellant in the country of origin?   If  not  why
             not?"

         94.      To this Mr Devereux replied on 24 November 2011:

             "We do accept, however, that in a case where a  third  country
             national is unable to claim a right to reside on the basis set
             out above it will not logically be  possible,  when  assessing
             the compatibility of their removal  or  deportation  with  the
             ECHR to argue that any  interference  with  Article  8  rights
             could be avoided by the family unit moving to a country  which
             is outside of the EU".

         95.      We shall take this helpful submission into account when we
         consider the application of Article 8 to each appellant's case.  We
         agree with it.  This means that  where  the  child  or  indeed  the
         remaining spouse is a British citizen and therefore  a  citizen  of
         the European Union, it is not possible to require them to  relocate
         outside of the European  Union  or  to  submit  that  it  would  be
         reasonable for them to do so. The  case  serves  to  emphasise  the
         importance of nationality already identified in the decision of the
         Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania). If  interference  with  the  family
         life is to be justified, it can only  be  on  the  basis  that  the
         conduct of the person to be removed gives rise to considerations of
         such weight as to justify separation.

         [emphasis added]

17. That has become known as the  'Sanade concession', and it still appears
    as a statement of policy in the Respondent's current guidance  document
    "Appendix FM 1.0 Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life:
    10-Year Routes (April 2015)":

         Where a decision to refuse the application would require a parent
         or primary carer to return to a country outside the EU, the case
         must always be assessed on the basis that it would be unreasonable
         to expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU with that parent
         or primary carer.

         In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to the
         parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the UK with
         the child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence of a
         genuine and subsisting parental relationship.

         It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where the
         conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to considerations
         of such weight as to justify separation, if the child could
         otherwise stay with another parent or alternative primary carer in
         the UK or in the EU.

18. It might be thought  in  light  of  that  concession,  when  read  with
    s177B(6), that this is the end of the matter and that the  appeal  must
    be allowed. There are certainly good reasons why  the  children  should
    not be expected to go to Nigeria.  Their mother's business in the UK is
    creating wealth, paying taxes and supporting them. If she were required
    to go to Nigeria (as would be the case with such young  children)  that
    business would likely be lost.   The boys  themselves are settled  here
    with their elder brother who is unlikely to be able to travel with them
    since his father is a British national. They are doing well at nursery.
    Awesomefidel needs regular check-ups with the specialist clinicians who
    have been treating his haematological disorder since  birth.   I  agree
    with the logical conclusion of the policy:  it  is  not  reasonable  to
    expect the children to leave.

19. Mr Tarlow argued that s117(6) could not be determinative of the matter,
    and that in fact the real question was why can't the  Appellant  return
    to Nigeria and apply for entry clearance?   The intention of parliament
    in enacting s177B was no doubt to  simplify  and  harmonise  Article  8
    decision-making.  It  is  therefore  unfortunate  that  the   trenchant
    terminology of s117B(6) does not appear to leave  room  for  manoeuvre:
    the public interest does not require the Appellant's  removal.    There
    is therefore nothing on the Respondent's side of the scales. Mr  Tarlow
    in effect asks me to read in to the  section  an  additional  provision
    reading "the public interest  does  require  removal  where  qualifying
    children can reasonably remain in the UK without the departing parent".
    That  would  certainly  be  consonant  with  Article  8   jurisprudence
    predating the  Immigration  Act  2014.  It  would  not  however  be  in
    accordance with the law as it is set out in s117B, nor indeed with  the
    express provisions of EX.1, the exception  in  Appendix  FM  that  this
    Appellant could have successfully relied upon  had  he  overstayed  his
    visit visa before making his application.

    Decisions

20. The determination contains an error of law and it is set aside.

21. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  on  human  rights
    grounds.

22. I make no direction for anonymity.  I was not asked to do so and on the
    facts it is not necessary.
