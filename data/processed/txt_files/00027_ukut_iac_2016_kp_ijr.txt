                                  JUDGMENT

Judge Grubb:

 1. I make an anonymity order under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) in the  light  of
    the applicant's claim for asylum.  This order prohibits the  disclosure
    directly or indirectly (including by the parties) of  the  identity  of
    the applicant.  Any disclosure in breach of this order may amount to  a
    contempt of court.  This order shall remain in force unless revoked  or
    varied by a Tribunal or Court.

Introduction

 2. The applicant challenges the respondent's decision of 28 May  2015  not
    to treat his further submissions as amounting to a 'fresh claim'  under
    para 353 of the Immigration Rules (Statement of Changes in  Immigration
    Rules, HC 395 as amended).

 3. The applicant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who was  born  on  14  February
    1984.  On 11 February 2010 he entered the United Kingdom with leave  as
    a student.  That leave was subsequently extended to  12  January  2014.
    However, following the revocation of the licence of his sponsor college
    on 7 July 2011, the Secretary of State curtailed the applicant's  leave
    to 12 February 2012.  On 10 January 2014, the applicant made a  further
    student application and on 24 February 2014 he  was  granted  leave  on
    that basis until  20  April  2015:  that  grant  of  leave  included  a
    condition prohibiting employment.

 4. On 30 July 2014, the applicant was apprehended  working  in  breach  of
    that condition of his leave and was served with form  IS151A.   He  was
    granted temporary release.  On 31 July 2014, he pleaded guilty  at  the
    Hendon Magistrates' Court  to  common  assault  and  was  conditionally
    discharged.

 5. On 23 September 2014, he requested  an  appointment  to  claim  asylum.
    That appointment was scheduled for 2 October 2014 but was  deferred  on
    that day because of illness.  Eventually,  on  10  February  2015,  the
    applicant claimed asylum.  On  12 February  2015,  the  applicant  was
    placed in the fast track procedure.  He was interviewed on 23  February
    2015.

 6. On 25 February 2015, the Secretary  of  State  refused  his  claim  for
    asylum and international protection generally.  The applicant  appealed
    and, following a hearing in the First-tier  Tribunal  (Immigration  and
    Asylum Chamber) on 6 March 2015, in a determination dated 9 March  2015
    Judge A J M Baldwin dismissed the applicant's appeal.  The  applicant's
    subsequent applications for permission to appeal against that  decision
    were refused by the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal.

 7. On 20 May 2015, the  applicant's  legal  representatives  made  further
    submissions to the Secretary of State.

 8. On 28 May 2015, the  Secretary  of  State  considered  the  applicant's
    further submissions and rejected them  concluding  that  they  did  not
    amount to a fresh claim under para 353 of the Immigration Rules.

 9. On 14 May 2015, the Secretary of State set removal directions to remove
    the applicant to Sri Lanka on 2 June 2015.

10.  In  response  to  that,  on  28  May  2015   the   applicant's   legal
    representatives sent a pre-action Protocol letter to the  Secretary  of
    State.

11. On 1 June 2015,  the  applicant  filed  these  proceedings  seeking  by
    judicial review to quash the respondent's decision of 28 May  2015  and
    seeking a declaration that the applicant's further  submissions  of  20
    May 2015 amounted to a fresh claim under para 353.

12. On 1 June 2015, HHJ Seys Llewellyn QC stayed  the  applicant's  removal
    until further order.

13. On 8 July 2015, HHJ Keyser QC granted the applicant permission to bring
    these proceedings.

The Applicant's Asylum Claim

14. The applicant's claim is based upon a relationship which he had with  a
    well-known actress in  Sri  Lanka  (whom  I  will  refer  to  as  "Z"),
    beginning in 2005.  She had political aspirations and between 2007  and
    2009 she had sexual relations with a number of political figures in Sri
    Lanka in hotel rooms which the applicant claimed  were  booked  in  his
    name.  During the liaisons, Z secretly recorded conversations with  the
    politician and their phone calls.  The implication is that she intended
    to use these recordings as leverage to further her political career.  Z
    asked the applicant to keep the recordings safe and that she would  pay
    him to do so.  As a result, he kept them in the loft  of  his  family's
    home.   The  applicant  claims  that  these   recordings   included   a
    conversation  on  how  Tamil  Tiger  leaders   had   been   killed   by
    extrajudicial execution in the so-called "white flag" incidents in  the
    final days of the civil war in Sri Lanka.  The applicant claims that  Z
    became an MP in April 2010.

15. In September 2010, the applicant claims that he was abducted,  detained
    and  mistreated  by  persons  who  demanded  that  he   surrender   the
    recordings.  He was released after ten days on  agreeing  to  surrender
    them.  Although he did not do so, he did destroy the recording and told
    Z that he had done so.  He went into hiding until  his  departure  from
    Sri Lanka could be arranged.  On 25 January 2010 he was issued  with  a
    student visa and he arrived in the UK on 11 February 2010.

16. The applicant claims that his parents have been threatened in Sri Lanka
    and they have, as a result, moved home and  his  sister  has  moved  to
    Australia.

17. The applicant claims that he would be at risk on return  to  Sri  Lanka
    from the well-known politicians who would want to obtain the  recording
    made by Z and which incriminate them and others.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

18. In her decision of 25 February 2015, the Secretary  of  State  rejected
    the appellant's claim for asylum, for humanitarian  protection  and  on
    human rights grounds.  The  Secretary  of  State  did  not  accept  the
    appellant's account that he had been  kidnapped  as  a  result  of  his
    safekeeping of conversation recorded by Z with a politician  with  whom
    she had sexual relationships.

19. Judge Baldwin dismissed the applicant's appeal.  He  accepted  much  of
    the applicant's account (although this was not accepted by  Ms  Bayoumi
    on behalf of the respondent before  me)  but,  nevertheless,  concluded
    that the applicant had failed to establish that he had  a  well-founded
    fear of persecution or serious ill-treatment if returned to Sri  Lanka.
    The judge's reasoning is set out at paras 21-22 of his determination as
    follows:

         "21. The Appellant claims that before [Z] became really well-known,
             he became involved with her  and  continued  the  relationship
             when he colluded with her in her successful attempts to record
             conversations and telephone calls made by high profile  people
             with whom she slept. He helped her by allowing his name to  be
             used to book hotel rooms and keeping the recordings, receiving
             "lots of money" from her for doing so. Photographs provided of
             her with  him  provide  some  degree  of  corroboration  of  a
             relationship between them. Whilst I accept  that  some  people
             may be prepared to say almost anything in  order  to  found  a
             claim to remain in the UK,  and  the  Appellant's  account  of
             events is quite extraordinary, it is also one which  I  accept
             would not be easy to tell as it reflects so poorly on his good
             judgement and standards. When I asked him questions  in  order
             to clarify certain matters, I found it difficult to get him to
             give concise or straightforward answers. In fairness to him, I
             accept that some of the inconsistencies, interpretation issues
             and  his  tendency  to  ramble  on  could  lead  the  listener
             struggling to make sense of it all.  However,  if  one  stands
             back a bit, one can see that there is a core  to  the  account
             which is fairly detailed and certainly not  inconsistent  with
             the unflattering impression given by articles  provided  about
             [Z]. I conclude that it is possible that  what  the  Appellant
             said about his relationship with her is true and that, over  5
             years ago, he may have been abducted and released on a promise
             that he would provide his abductors with the recordings.   The
             question which remains is, even if that is all  so,  would  he
             face a well-founded risk of persecution and /or  serious  ill-
             treatment if returned to Sri Lanka.

         22.  The Appellant has made it clear that he threw  the  recordings
             into a river and  told  [Z]  he  had  done  so.  There  is  no
             suggestion that [Z] has disappeared or suffered some  dreadful
             fate and, as a well known M.P., it  is  reasonable  to  assume
             that if anything had happened to her it would have been  roper
             reported quite widely in Sri Lanka and would have surfaced  in
             the background material searches undertaken by or on behalf of
             the Appellant. Having been unable to find the Appellant in the
             last five years, anyone wanting those recordings would  surely
             have moved against  her  and,  if  they  did  not  accept  her
             assertions about them having been thrown into a river, gone on
             to ransack his family home in order to try and find them - yet
             there is no  suggestion  that  this  has  happened.  The  only
             interference one can reasonably draw from this is that  anyone
             with a particular interest in these recordings  has  satisfied
             themselves that the recordings  have  been  disposed  of.  The
             Appellant's claim that his sister has been forced to  move  to
             Australia and his parents have been threatened and had to move
             is, I find, very likely to be an  embellishment  of  what  may
             otherwise well be a  broadly  true  account.  Furthermore,  if
             adverse active interest in him had continued, it is simply not
             credible that the Appellant would have taken 4.5 years to work
             out he needed to claim asylum.  He  may  have  a  tendency  to
             ramble on in his speech, but there is no suggestion  he  would
             have been incapable of finding out what his options  were  for
             ensuring he did not have to return to Sri  Lanka.  Whether  or
             not he had continuous leave from the moment he set foot in the
             UK, he knew he was only here to study.  With  no  evidence  of
             study in recent years, and through working here unlawfully, he
             must have realised that his right to remain in  the  U.K.  was
             far from being assured. His failure to claim  asylum  a  great
             deal sooner strongly suggests he does not genuinely believe he
             would now  be  at  real  risk  in  Sri  Lanka,  the  abduction
             notwithstanding."

20. As a consequence, Judge Baldwin dismissed the applicant's appeal.

The Applicant's Further Submissions

21. In his further submissions made on 20 May 2015,  the  applicant  relied
    upon three documents.  First,  an  expert's  report  by  Dr  Suthaharan
    Nadaraja (at pages 86-104 of the bundle).  Secondly, a letter from  the
    Chief Minister of the North Western Province  Council  dated  22  April
    2015 (at page 105 of the bundle).  Finally, a letter from a  member  of
    the Sri Lankan Parliament, Mr Katagodo dated 17 April 2015 (at page 106
    of the bundle).

22. The expert's report dealt with  a  number  of  matters,  including  the
    background in Sri Lanka and the "white flag" incident and the  position
    of Z as an MP  in  Sri  Lanka.   For  present  purposes,  the  expert's
    conclusions are set out in paras 42-45 of his report as follows:

         "The risk on return for our client from the powerful politicians he
         has mentioned a fear of.

         42.  The client has listed Sarath Fonseka and Gotabaya Rajapaksa as
             among the Sri Lankan political figures he fears. He says  that
             he has been in possession of recordings of these  individuals'
             conversations made by [Z] and passed on to him. He  also  says
             he admitted possession of these to those who had kidnapped and
             ill-treated him in 2009 and had  agreed  to  hand  over  these
             recordings, but had not done so.  In  particular,  the  client
             said the recordings included one  of  Field  Marshall  Fonseka
             speaking of the 'white flag' incident i.e. in his words, "when
             the Tamil Tigers came to  surrender  with  white  flags,  [the
             recording that] contained that [sic] conversation an  how  the
             government decided to kill them all."  The  client  says  this
             recording  shows  the  government  was  'corrupt';   but,   as
             discussed  above,  in  fact  Fonseka's   comments   implicates
             Gotabaya and top  army  commanders  in  a  war-crime  that  is
             amongst those of particular international focus, including  at
             the UN. At the same time, the recording, if made public, would
             again do considerable damage to Field Marshall  Fonseka's  now
             revived standing in Sri Lanka, given this  attribution  (which
             he later vehemently denied) was the basis of the  government's
             charges against him under the PTA.

         43.  As such, the client faces a serious risk of being detained  or
             abducted and suffering ill-treatment and harm. The client says
             he destroyed the  recordings  (while  drunk),  but  given  the
             international and domestic stakes of  Fonseka's  link  to  the
             'white flag' incident, there is every likelihood he would  not
             be believed by the authorities.

         Whether it is likely that our client would not be  at  risk  simply
         because [Z] herself has not been targeted;

         44.  As discussed above,  despite  initially  supporting  Fonseka's
             presidential bid against  Rajapaksa,  [Z]  switched  sides  to
             Rajapaksa's government soon after being elected  MP  in  2010,
             and has since provided unqualified support. Moreover, she is a
             well-known and popular actress (garnering a  substantial  vote
             in the 2010 elections greater than a  prominent  UNP  figure).
             Thus it is not surprising that she has not  been  targeted  by
             the  government.  However,  [Z's]  good  relations  with   the
             government (past and, seemingly, present) has no  relation  to
             the potential risk to the client, which, for the  reasons  set
             out above, is very serious.

         The likelihood of our client being arrested at a Sri Lankan port of
         entry

         45.  I cannot speak with certainty  to  this;  however,  given  the
             client is likely now known to Fonseka and Gotabaya as  someone
             in possession of  potentially  damaging  recordings,  I  would
             expect there to be considerable urgency  on  their  respective
             parts to recover these and to prevent the client from speaking
             to the contents thereof. [Also, the client  has  mentioned  in
             interview that  one  of  the  four  politicians  he  fears  is
             'Dominda Silva', whose men he says abducted and assaulted  him
             an effort to recover the recordings and with whose brother [Z]
             had sexual relations. I presume he  is  referring  to  Duminda
             Silva, MP, who, elected in 2004 on the opposition  UNP  ticket
             crossed over to Rajapaksa's  ruling  UPFA  coalition  in  2007
             reportedly  in  exchange  for  the  government  restoring  the
             cancelled  broadcasting  licence  of  the  Asia   Broadcasting
             Corporation  owned  by  his  (Silva's)  brother.  Duminda  was
             elected on the UPFA ticket in 2010.]."

23. At para 46, the expert also commented on, as plausible, the practice of
    targeting family members in Sri Lanka who threaten government  figures.



24. The letter from  the  Chief  Minister  spoke  of  the  threats  to  the
    applicant's family and that in the "personal opinion of the writer, the
    applicant should not return to Sri Lanka".

25. Finally, the letter from the Member of Parliament spoke of the  threats
    to the applicant and, again, indicated that he should not return to Sri
    Lanka.

26. I have only briefly referred to the contents of the two letters because
    Mr Hoshi, who represented the applicant, placed no reliance  upon  them
    in his oral submissions before me.  The focus of his case was upon  the
    expert evidence.

The Respondent's Decision of 28 May 2015

27. In response to those submissions, the Secretary of State  rejected  the
    appellant's claim and concluded they did not amount to  a  fresh  claim
    under para 353 of the Rules.

28. At para 5 of her decision letter, the Secretary of State dealt with the
    expert evidence as follows:

         "5.  With regards to the expert report it is noted that you  submit
             that this is "clear proof" that your client would be  at  risk
             on return to  Sri  Lanka.  However,  it  is  noted  that  when
             discussing the likelihood of your  client  being  arrested  on
             return to Sri Lanka the  expert  at  paragraph  45  states  "I
             cannot speak with certainty to this, however given the  client
             is likely now known...as someone in possession of  potentially
             damaging recordings, I would expect there to  be  considerable
             urgency on their respective parts to recover these and prevent
             the client from speaking  to  the  contents  thereof".  It  is
             considered that the expert is merely  speculating  as  to  the
             actions the authorities in Sri Lanka might take. In  addition,
             he is unable to provide any explanation as to how, if that was
             the case, your client was able to leave the country, using his
             own identity without any  problems  some  5  months  after  he
             allegedly  came  to  the  attention  of  the  politicians  who
             subsequently sent people to recover the  tapes  from  him.  In
             addition,  the  immigration  judge  in  his  determination  of
             09/03/2015  at  para  22  found  that  "Anyone  wanting  those
             recordings would surely have moved against her ([Z])...or gone
             on to ransack his family home in order to try  and  find  them
             yet there is no suggestion that this has happened.,  The  only
             inference one can reasonably draw from  this  is  that  anyone
             with a particular interest in these recordings  has  satisfied
             themselves that they have been disposed  of".  No  explanation
             has been provided to counter the judges findings. Although you
             claim that a "significant error has been made in  our  clients
             case which has lead to the conclusion that  our  client  would
             not be at risk on return", your claims  in  this  regard  were
             considered after your appeal to both the First and Upper  Tier
             tribunal for permission to  appeal.   This  determination  was
             upheld by the Upper Tribunal Judge on 23 March 2015 who  noted
             "I have paid full regard to  the  findings  of  fact  made  in
             favour of the appellant by the Judge but the challenge made in
             the grounds is a perversity challenge attacking the assessment
             of risk. Paragraph 22 of the determination  is  a  proper  and
             adequate analysis of risk and cannot, even arguably,  be  said
             to be perverse."  Therefore,  it  is  not  accepted  that  the
             contents of the said expert report would  create  a  realistic
             prospect of success before an immigration judge."

29. In para 6 of her decision letter (at pages 64-69  of  the  bundle)  the
    Secretary of State dealt with the two letters from the  Chief  Minister
    and the MP as follows:

         "6.  Lastly, it is noted that you have submitted 2 letters  from  a
             member of parliament in Sri Lanka and also a Minister  of  one
             of the Provinces. These letters claim that your client is  not
             safe to return to Sri Lanka at present. However, taking  these
             into account, regard must be given to the  Country  of  Origin
             report for Sri Lanka March 2012 at para 27 which states:

             A letter from the British High Commission (BHC) Colombo  dated
             14 September 2010 reported:

                  "The base document for many services in Sri Lanka  is  the
                  birth certificate, and  in  particular,  access  to  state
                  education requires the production of  this  document.  The
                  document also supports applications for national  identity
                  cards and passports. The British High Commission is  aware
                  that  forged  birth  certificates  are  readily  available
                  through agents, at a reported cost  of  around  2,500  LKA
                  rupees  (approximately  �12.50).  These  forged  documents
                  often pass the scrutiny of the  relevant  authorities  and
                  successfully support the fraudulent issue of ID cards  and
                  passports.   There  are  numerous  agents  throughout  the
                  country who advertise employment or  studies  abroad,  and
                  will provide an entire  package  of  forged  documents  to
                  support applications for  passports  and/or  visas.  Apart
                  from  birth  certificates,  these   can   include   forged
                  passports, identity cards, educational certificates,  work
                  references, bank statements, sponsorship letters etc."

             The BHC letter of 14 September 2010 added that:

                  "The high  level  of  corruption  in  Sri  Lanka  and  the
                  unscrupulous  actions  of  government  officials  at   all
                  levels, somewhat undermines the issuing process  for  many
                  official documents. It is common  knowledge  that  persons
                  can obtain an ID card or passport  in  any  identity  they
                  want to with the right contacts. The Visa Section at  this
                  mission regularly see forged education certificates,  bank
                  statements, employment references etc, yet they rarely see
                  forged Sri Lankan passports or ID cards.  The  reason  for
                  this is that the genuine documents are so easy  to  obtain
                  fraudulently, there is  no  need  to  forge  them.  It  is
                  suspected that there are many more ID cards in circulation
                  than the actual total population of Sri Lanka."

         7.   In addition, it is noted that it has never been your  evidence
             that you have had any political involvement in Sri  Lanka  and
             therefore  it  is  unclear  how  you  are  known  to  these  2
             Government officials or how they are aware  of  your  problems
             within the country. In addition, it is noted  that  they  have
             not been sent direct from the authors of the letters but by  a
             S.C.P. It is not clear who this person is or why  the  letters
             would have been given to him before being forwarded to you. In
             addition, the content of the letter is  considered  completely
             vague and self serving. It is also  noted  that  both  letters
             refer to you  and  your  family  having  received  verbal  and
             physical threats many times when  that  has  never  been  your
             evidence. As a result, no weight is placed on these in support
             of your further submissions".

30. In conclusion, the respondent stated (at para 8 of the  decision)  that
    the further submissions had "no realistic prospect of success".

The Applicant's Challenge

31. The applicant's challenge is set  out  in  the  grounds,  the  skeleton
    argument of Mr Hoshi and his oral  submissions  before  me.   Mr  Hoshi
    placed exclusive reliance upon the expert report  of  Dr  Nadaraja  and
    submitted that the respondent's decision letter had failed properly  to
    deal with it.

32. Mr Hoshi submitted that Judge Baldwin had made a  positive  credibility
    finding in relation to the  applicant's  account  in  para  21  of  his
    determination.  He had, Mr Hoshi submitted,  accepted  the  applicant's
    relationship  with  Z,  that  she  had  made  the  recordings  of   the
    politicians as the applicant claimed and that as a result he  had  been
    abducted in order to obtain them.  Mr Hoshi submitted that in  para  22
    of his determination the judge had given  three  reasons  why,  despite
    those positive findings, he had not accepted that the applicant was  at
    risk  on  return.   First,  the  judge  had  concluded  that  the  only
    reasonable inference that could be drawn from the fact that Z  had  not
    suffered any problems was  that  those  who  had  an  interest  in  the
    recordings were satisfied that they had been  disposed  of.   Secondly,
    the applicant's claim had been embellished when he said that his family
    had had to move, including his sister to Australia.  Thirdly, the judge
    had relied on the applicant's delay of  some  four  and  a  half  years
    before he claimed asylum if, in truth, he genuinely feared  persecution
    on return to Sri Lanka.

33. Mr Hoshi submitted that in para 44  of  his  report,  Dr  Nadaraja  had
    explained why it was likely  that  Z  had  not  been  targeted  by  the
    government.  This,  Mr  Hoshi  submitted  was  not  considered  by  the
    Secretary of State in para 5 of her decision  letter  when  considering
    the expert report.  That, he submitted, flawed her  decision.   In  the
    light  of  that  evidence  she  was  not  entitled  to  find  that  the
    applicant's claim did not have a realistic prospect of success before a
    judge on appeal.

34. Mr Hoshi also submitted that the respondent had been wrong to  discount
    the expert's report.  In para 45, although he had  said  he  could  not
    "speak with certainty" whether the applicant would be arrested  at  the
    port of entry, the tenor of his remarks (in particular in para 43)  was
    that the applicant would be at risk in Sri Lanka.

35. Mr Hoshi submitted that it was not a proper  basis  for  rejecting  the
    expert's report that he had not explained how the applicant was able to
    leave Sri Lanka without any problems  or  had  remained  in  Sri  Lanka
    safely for some months.  In relation to the  former,  Mr  Hoshi  relied
    upon what was said in He v  SSHD  [2002]  EWCA  Civ  1150  at  [31]  by
    Schiemann LJ that:

         "history contains examples of regimes which persecute a minority in
         their home country but are content for them  to  leave  their  home
         country.  Their attitude is: we just do not want them here."

36. As regards the latter, Mr Hoshi pointed out that the applicant  claimed
    to be in hiding for the period of time he remained in Sri Lanka  before
    leaving.

37. Mr Hoshi submitted that the respondent's decision letter failed to give
    "anxious scrutiny" to the applicant's new  submissions,  in  particular
    failed to have regard to the positive credibility findings made by  the
    judge and Dr Nadaraja's report which, he submitted, created a realistic
    prospect of success.

The Respondent's Position

38. The respondent's position  is  set  out  in  the  detailed  grounds  of
    defence, in Ms Bayoumi's skeleton argument and in her oral submissions.



39. First, Ms Bayoumi submitted that Judge  Baldwin  had  not  in  para  22
    accepted the applicant's account.

40. Secondly, she submitted that the respondent in her decision letter  had
    adequately considered the expert's  report.   She  submitted  that  the
    expert had failed  to  deal  with  Judge  Baldwin's  other  reason  for
    rejecting the appellant's claim, namely his delay in  claiming  asylum,
    how he was able to remain in Sri Lanka safely for a  number  of  months
    after his abduction, and how he left Sri Lanka without difficulty.   As
    regards the latter, Ms Bayoumi submitted that the decision  in  He  did
    not assist the applicant as this was not a case where those who  sought
    the applicant would prefer that he left the country.  They wanted,  she
    submitted, to obtain the recordings from him.

41. Ms Bayoumi submitted that the expert report did not, in fact, take  the
    applicant's claim any further.  She submitted that there were  not  any
    findings of substance in the report which assisted the  applicant.   In
    relation to threats to the applicant's family, she pointed out that the
    expert has  simply  stated  that  they  were  targeted.   She  drew  my
    attention to two references, to the same  event,  where  the  applicant
    claimed his family had been threatened in his statement at para 6 (page
    114 of the bundle) and in his asylum interview at question 102 (at page
    115 of the bundle).  She submitted  that  it  was  not  wrong  for  the
    respondent to say that the threats to the family were not a significant
    part of his claim and had not added to it.

42. Ms Bayoumi submitted that the Secretary of State had been  entitled  to
    conclude, on the basis of Judge  Baldwin's  findings,  particularly  in
    para 22, that taking account of the further submissions made, there was
    not a  realistic  prospect  of  a  judge  on  appeal  deciding  in  the
    applicant's favour.

Discussion

43. The relevant law is common ground between the parties.

44. The definition of a 'fresh claim' is set out in para 353 of  the  Rules
    as follows:

         "When a human rights or asylum  claim  has  been  refused  and  any
         appeal relating to that claim is no longer  pending,  the  decision
         maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected,  will
         then  determine  whether  they  amount  to  a  fresh  claim.    The
         submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are  significantly
         different from the material that has  previously  been  considered.
         The  submissions  will  only  be  significantly  different  if  the
         content:

          i) had not already been considered; and

         ii)  taken  together  with  the  previously  considered  material,
             created a realistic prospect of success,  notwithstanding  its
             rejection.

        This paragraph does not apply to claims made overseas."

45. The correct approach to para 353 is set out  in  the  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in WM (DRC) v SSHD [2006] EWCA  Civ  1495  and  in  the
    judgment of Buxton LJ at [6]-[7] and [10]-[11] as follows:

         '6.  There was broad agreement as to the Secretary of State's  task
         under rule 353.  He has to consider the new material together  with
         the old and make two judgements.  First, whether the  new  material
         is significantly different from  that  already  submitted,  on  the
         basis of which the asylum claim has failed, that to be judged under
         rule 353(i) according to whether the content of  the  material  has
         already been considered.  If the  material  is  not  "significantly
         different" the Secretary of State has to go no further.  Second, if
         the material is significantly different, the Secretary of State has
         to consider whether it, taken together with the material previously
         considered, creates a realistic prospect of success  in  a  further
         asylum claim.  That second judgement will involve not only  judging
         the reliability of the new material, but also judging  the  outcome
         of the tribunal proceedings based on that material.  To  set  aside
         one point that was said  to  be  a  matter  of  some  concern,  the
         Secretary of State, in assessing the reliability of  new  material,
         can of course have in mind both how the material relates  to  other
         material already found by an adjudicator to be reliable,  and  also
         have in mind, where that is relevantly probative, any finding as to
         the honesty or reliability of the applicant that was  made  by  the
         previous adjudicator.  However, he must also bear in mind that  the
         latter may be of little relevance when, as is alleged  in  both  of
         the particular cases before us, the new material does  not  emanate
         from  the  applicant  himself,  and  thus  cannot  be  said  to  be
         automatically suspect because it comes from a tainted source.

         7.   The  rule  only  imposes  a  somewhat  modest  test  that  the
         application has to meet before it becomes a  fresh  claim.   First,
         the question is whether there is a realistic prospect of success in
         an application before an  adjudicator,  but  not  more  than  that.
         Second, as Mr Nicol QC pertinently  pointed  out,  the  adjudicator
         himself does not have to achieve certainty, but only to think  that
         there is a real risk of the applicant being persecuted  on  return.
         Third, and importantly, since asylum is in issue the  consideration
         of all the decision-makers, the Secretary of State, the adjudicator
         and the court, must be informed by  the  anxious  scrutiny  of  the
         material that is axiomatic in decisions that  if  made  incorrectly
         may lead to the applicant's exposure to persecution.  If  authority
         is needed for that proposition, see per Lord Bridge of  Harwich  in
         Bugdaycay v SSHD [1987] AC 514 at p.531F [...].

         ....

         10.  That, however, is by no means the end of the matter.  Although
         the  issue  was  not  pursued  in  detail,  the  court  in  Cakabay
         recognised, at p191, that in any asylum case anxious scrutiny  must
         enter the equation: see �7 above.  Whilst, therefore, the  decision
         remains that of the Secretary of State, and  the  test  is  one  of
         irrationality, a decision will be irrational if it is not taken  on
         the basis of anxious scrutiny.  Accordingly, a court when reviewing
         a decision of the Secretary of State as to whether  a  fresh  claim
         exists must address the following matters.

         11.  First, has the Secretary of State asked  himself  the  correct
         question?  The question is  not  whether  the  Secretary  of  State
         himself thinks that the new claim is a good one or should  succeed,
         but whether there  is  a  realistic  prospect  of  an  adjudicator,
         applying the rule of anxious scrutiny, thinking that the  applicant
         will be exposed to a real risk of persecution  on  return:  see  �7
         above.  The Secretary of State of course  and  no  doubt  logically
         should, treat his own view of the merits as  a  starting-point  for
         that enquiry; but it is only a starting-point in the  consideration
         of a question that is distinctly different from the exercise of the
         Secretary of State making up his own mind.  Second,  in  addressing
         that question, both in respect of the evaluation of the  facts  and
         in respect of the legal conclusions to be drawn from  those  facts,
         has the Secretary of State satisfied  the  requirement  of  anxious
         scrutiny?  If the court cannot be satisfied that the answer to both
         of those questions is in the affirmative it will have to  grant  an
         application for review of the Secretary of State's decision.'

46. As this makes plain, the Secretary of  State's  decision  can  only  be
    challenged on  public  law  grounds,  principally  irrationality  which
    includes a requirement that the Secretary of  State  give  the  further
    submissions "anxious scrutiny".  Further, the issue which the Secretary
    of State must decide is whether, taking the previous material with  the
    new material, there is a "realistic prospect of success" before a judge
    on appeal.  The test is not whether the Secretary of  State  considered
    that there is a "realistic prospect of success" but rather looks to the
    decision that a judge would make on appeal.  A "reasonable prospect  of
    success" means only "more than a fanciful such  prospect"  (see  R  (AK
    (Sri Lanka)) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 447 at [34] per Laws LJ).

47. Paragraph 353 imposes "a somewhat modest test" in the dual  sense  that
    the question is whether there is  a  "realistic  prospect  of  success"
    before a judge and also that, in determining the success of an  appeal,
    a judge need only conclude that there is a "real risk" to the applicant
    of being persecuted on return.

48. The starting point for the respondent, as Ms Bayoumi  accepted  in  her
    submissions, was  Judge  Baldwin's  decision.   I  do  not  accept  her
    submission that in para 21 of his  determination,  the  judge  did  not
    accept a number of aspects of the applicant's  claim.   His  conclusion
    that it was "possible" in the penultimate sentence of para 21 that what
    the applicant  had  said  about  his  relationship  with  Z,  that  the
    recordings had been made and he had been abducted and released only  on
    a promise that he would provide those recordings can only mean, on  the
    standard applicable in asylum cases,  that  the  judge  accepted  those
    matters as found in the applicant's favour.

49. If there was any doubt about that, the final sentence of para 21  makes
    plain that the judge considered that, having stated that the  applicant
    had established that these matters were possible,  the  question  which
    remained was whether "even if that is all so"  he  had  a  well-founded
    risk of persecution or serious ill-treatment if returned to Sri  Lanka.
    In other words, the judge moved on to consider the  objective  risk  to
    the applicant on the basis of what I am  satisfied  were  his  previous
    findings of fact in favour of the applicant.

50. When the judge did that in para 22, he concluded that the applicant had
    failed to establish that he was objectively at risk for three  reasons.
    First, on the basis that Z had  not  suffered  any  problems  over  the
    recordings, the judge concluded that:

         "the only inference one can  reasonably  draw  from  that  is  that
         anyone with a particular interest in these recordings has satisfied
         themselves that the recordings have been disposed of".

51. Secondly, the applicant had embellished his account  about  his  family
    having to move.  Thirdly, that if  he  had  a  genuine  fear  that  was
    inconsistent with him having taken four  and  a  half  years  to  claim
    asylum.

52. It seems to me that Dr Nadaraja's report  directly  attacked  the  only
    reasonable inference which the judge felt compelled to draw, based upon
    Z having suffered no difficulty over the recording.  In his report,  Dr
    Nadaraja specifically deals with them at para 44 explaining why it  was
    "not surprising that [Z] has not been targeted by the government."

53. In her refusal letter, in particular at para 5, the Secretary of  State
    makes no mention  of  this  evidence.   That  was  highly  relevant  in
    assessing whether there was a realistic prospect of  success  before  a
    judge, given that was one of the three reasons given in Judge Baldwin's
    determination for concluding that there was no objective  risk  to  the
    applicant.  If a judge were to accept Dr Nadaraja's view,  and  it  was
    not subject to any challenge by the respondent, that would run a "coach
    and horses" through Judge Baldwin's reasoning why the applicant was not
    at risk.

54. The remaining two reasons given in para 22 were less direct in refuting
    the applicant's case on objective risk, namely the embellishment of his
    claim about his  family  and  his  delay  in  claiming  asylum.   Judge
    Baldwin's reliance upon the 'only reasonable inference'  point  is  not
    only first in his reasons for  rejecting  any  objective  risk  to  the
    applicant but is also, in my judgement, the most powerful and  the  one
    capable of sustaining his ultimate finding.

55. The Secretary of State was wrong when in para 5 of her  refusal  letter
    she said that: "no explanation has been provided to counter the judge's
    findings".  That is said directly  following  a  quotation  from  Judge
    Baldwin's determination at para 22  based  upon  the  'only  reasonable
    inference' that could be drawn from the fact that Z  had  not  suffered
    any problems over the recordings.  In  my  judgement,  para  5  of  the
    Secretary of State's decision letter does not demonstrate that she  has
    applied "anxious scrutiny" to Dr Nadaraja's report and  the  supportive
    material in it to the applicant's claim.

56. I do not  accept  Ms  Bayoumi's  submission  that  the  report  can  be
    discounted because it does not deal with some of the judge's  reasoning
    and, as I understood Ms Bayoumi's submissions,  points  that  were  not
    relied upon by the judge at all.

57. True it is that Dr Nadaraja does not refer to the issue  of  delay  but
    that is hardly a matter within his expertise to assess its implications
    for the applicant's claim.  He does, however, deal with the applicant's
    claimed threats to his family and states that they are plausible.

58. Ms Bayoumi also relied upon Dr Nadaraja's failure to deal with how  the
    applicant had safely remained in Sri Lanka after his abduction and  had
    been able to leave safely.  These were not matters relied upon by Judge
    Baldwin in reaching his  findings.   He  did,  after  all,  accept  the
    credibility of the core aspects  of  the  appellant's  account.   Judge
    Baldwin's decision turned upon whether the applicant had established an
    objective risk to him.  He took neither of the matters relied  upon  by
    Ms Bayoumi into account in reaching his finding  in  para  22.   It  is
    difficult, therefore, to criticise the  expert  for  not  dealing  with
    matters not relied upon by the judge whose  determination  and  finding
    were the starting point for the  Secretary  of  State's  assessment  of
    whether the applicant's claim amounted to a fresh claim.   The  obvious
    response, of course, as to how the applicant was able to remain safe in
    Sri Lanka after his abduction was that he went into hiding.   That  was
    not a matter of expert evidence.  It may well be, as Ms Bayoumi pointed
    out, that  the  approach  in  He  has  no  direct  application  to  the
    applicant's circumstances.  His claimed pursuers might well need him to
    remain in Sri Lanka in order to recover the  incriminating  recordings.
    That may well be a relevant matter in assessing the  applicant's  claim
    overall, but it was not a matter raised by the judge and it was not, in
    itself, a good enough reason for rejecting the expert evidence.

59. Drawing my reasons together, I accept Mr Hoshi's  submission  that  the
    Secretary of State  has  failed  properly  to  take  into  account  the
    totality of the expert report in rejecting the  applicant's  claim  and
    concluding that it did not amount to a fresh claim under  para  353  of
    the  Rules.   She  has  failed  to  apply  "anxious  scrutiny"  to  the
    applicant's  claim,  in  particular   the   further   submissions   and
    consequently her conclusion that the applicant's claim did not  have  a
    realistic prospect of success before a judge on  appeal  is  flawed  on
    public law principles.

60. I reach that decision on the basis of the Secretary of State's  failure
    properly to consider the expert report.  Mr Hoshi did not rely upon the
    two letters which were part of the further submissions and I  need  say
    no more about them.

Decision

61. For the above  reasons,  the  respondent's  decision  of  28  May  2015
    rejecting the applicant's claim and concluding that it did  not  amount
    to a fresh claim under para  353  of  the  Rules  was  unlawful.   That
    decision is quashed.

62. Mr Hoshi invited me  also  to  declare  that  the  applicant's  further
    submission did amount to a fresh claim.  That would only be appropriate
    if the respondent could only make a decision  under  para  353  in  the
    applicant's favour.  My reasons for concluding that  her  decision  was
    unlawful does not necessarily imply that consequence.  Therefore, I  do
    not propose to take, what Mr Hoshi accepted was an unusual  course,  of
    making a declaration in the terms he sought.

                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
