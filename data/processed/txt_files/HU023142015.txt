For the respondent:          Mr L. Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer






                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed against the respondent's decision to  refuse  a
    human rights claim within the context of deportation proceedings. First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Broe  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the  appeal  in  a
    decision promulgated on 26 April 2016.

2.    The appellant seeks to appeal the decision on the following grounds:

       i) The First-tier Tribunal failed  to  take  into  account  relevant
          considerations in assessing whether it would  be  "unduly  harsh"
          for the appellant's son to be separated from him for the  purpose
          of paragraph 399(a) of the immigration rules.

      ii) The  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to  have  regard  to  relevant
          matters, or had  regard  to  matters  that  were  unsupported  by
          evidence, in  assessing  whether  there  were  "very  significant
          obstacles" to reintegration for the purpose of paragraph 399(A).


     iii) The First-tier Tribunal conflated the proper test to  be  applied
          under Article 8 for the purpose of paragraph 398 and/or erred  in
          purporting to assess the case outside the rules.


      iv) The First-tier Tribunal made errors  of  fact  that  called  into
          question whether the decision  was  made  on  the  correct  basis
          and/or that sufficient scrutiny was given to  such  an  important
          decision.

Decision and reasons

Background

3.    A brief summary of the factual circumstances of the  case  will  place
    my findings in context. The appellant entered the UK  with  his  family
    when he was seven years old. The family were  recognised  as  refugees.
    The appellant has been resident in the UK for a  period  of  nearly  40
    years. He grew up in the UK and has spent all his adult life in the UK.
    The appellant has fathered three children. "C" is  21  years  old.  His
    brother "L" is 17 ï¿½ years old. They  are  both  British  citizens.  The
    appellant split from their mother in 2001. The third  child  "A"  is  6
    years old but it would appear that he  has  no  meaningful  contact  or
    relationship with the child. The appellant's  father  died  within  the
    last year. His mother is  66  years  old.  She  suffers  from  a  heart
    condition. She says that she no longer has any other close relatives in
    the UK apart from her son. She would like him to support her during her
    retirement. It does not appear to  be  disputed  that  the  appellant's
    brother was deported and  currently  lives  in  Chile  but  no  further
    information has been provided.

4.    The appellant has a long list of convictions,  the  details  of  which
    are set out in the respondent's decision letter. Between  08  May  1989
    and 18 October 2012 he was convicted on 12 occasions for  16  offences.
    All of the convictions were as an  adult.  Some  convictions  are  more
    serious than others. But even the less serious convictions bear out the
    last sentencing judge's  finding  that  the  appellant  is  a  "man  of
    violence". The convictions include offences of common assault,  assault
    occasioning actual bodily harm, assault with intent  to  resist  arrest
    and use of abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause
    fear or provocation of violence. I note that most of the offences which
    incurred  non-custodial  sentences  occurred  between   1989-1998   and
    therefore took place some time ago. However, in 1998 the appellant  was
    sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for grievous bodily harm.

5.    It seems that there was a hiatus in convictions until  2009,  when  he
    was sentenced to 33 months imprisonment for possessing  a  handgun  and
    ammunition without a certificate. The appellant was then convicted of a
    series  of  breaches  of  a  non-molestation  order  culminating  in  a
    conviction for wounding/grievous bodily harm in 2012. He was  sentenced
    to 37 months imprisonment for the grievous bodily harm  offence  and  a
    consecutive sentence of  12  months  for  the  further  breach  of  the
    restraining order. The offences involved his former partner; the mother
    of the  youngest  child  who  he  head-butted  and  punched  causing  a
    fractured jaw. The sentencing judge  took  into  account  a  number  of
    aggravating factors including his previous convictions for violence and
    the fact that his child was present (who  he  reportedly  dropped  when
    bringing the child downstairs after the incident).

6.    The sentencing judge concluded that he posed a  high  risk  to  future
    partners. An OASys assessment carried out in November 2014 assessed him
    to be a medium risk of serious harm towards others in the community and
    a high risk of serious  harm  to  a  known  adult.  The  appellant  was
    released on licence on 20 March  2015.  A  letter  from  his  probation
    officer dated 18 January 2016 stated  that  the  appellant  was  making
    progress and had been re-assessed as posing a medium  risk  of  serious
    harm to partners and any future partners. There was no suggestion  that
    the risk assessment in relation to other members of the  community  had
    been reduced. A further letter dated 15 June 2015 stated  that  he  was
    deregistered from MAPPA level 2 and was  now  being  managed  at  MAPPA
    level 1. It is in the context of  the  appellant's  criminal  offending
    that the respondent decided to make a deportation order.

7.    A number of compassionate circumstances were put  forward  in  support
    of the argument that  the  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the
    exceptions to deportation, or in the alternative, that there  are  very
    compelling  circumstances  that  outweigh  the   public   interest   in
    deportation.

8.    Clearly the appellant has been settled in  the  UK  for  a  very  long
    period of time and has spent the majority of  his  life  here.  It  was
    asserted that it would be unduly harsh on his son  L  to  be  separated
    from his father at a time when he has re-established contact  following
    his father's imprisonment. He found it very difficult when  his  father
    was in prison and says that he felt depressed. L is in need of parental
    support from his father because he has already been through a difficult
    period after his mother was diagnosed and treated  for  cancer.  It  is
    unclear from the documentary evidence how recent  her  illness  was.  L
    still lives with his mother. C has also had health  problems.  He  said
    that he had an operation to remove a section of his lung. He said  that
    he was moving into his grandmother's home because she had no  one  else
    to help her. Understandably, the appellant's mother and his children do
    not want him to be deported and consider  the  prospect  of  separation
    from him very difficult.

The First-tier Tribunal decision

9.    The Upper Tribunal's assessment focusses  on  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point  of  law.
    Even if the decision involved an error it must be one that was  capable
    of making a material difference to the outcome of the appeal.

10.   The judge set out the facts and oral evidence in some  detail  [9-24].
    He had the opportunity of hearing from the  appellant  and  four  other
    witnesses including the appellant's mother, his children and  a  family
    friend. He then set out a summary of the relevant law and  went  on  to
    make findings in relation to the exceptions to deportation [29-38]. The
    judge concluded that deportation would not be unduly  harsh  on  L  and
    that the appellant did not meet  the  private  life  exception  because
    there were not 'very  significant  obstacles'  to  integration  in  his
    country of birth [32-38]. He went on to  consider  whether  there  were
    'very compelling circumstances' that might outweigh the public interest
    in deportation but concluded that deportation was proportionate in  the
    circumstances of this case [39-42].

11.   Most of the grounds seek to identify errors in the  judge's  findings,
    either in respect of alleged failures  to  consider  material  matters,
    reliance on matters that were not supported by  evidence  or  based  on
    mistakes of fact. The grounds also assert that there is  some  question
    mark over whether the First-tier Tribunal understood  and  applied  the
    correct legal test.

12.   I can deal with the second ground of appeal quite briefly.  I  do  not
    consider that there is any merit  in  the  arguments  relating  to  the
    judge's findings regarding the test outlined in paragraph 399A  of  the
    immigration rules. The judge was clearly aware of  the  fact  that  the
    appellant came to the UK as a young child.  The  appellant  would  have
    spoken Spanish for the first seven years of his life. However,  it  was
    reasonable to him to infer from the fact that  the  appellant's  mother
    spoke Spanish at home with her husband that  the  appellant  must  have
    some understanding of Spanish even if he no  longer  considers  it  his
    first  language.  The  judge's  finding  is  not  outside  a  range  of
    reasonable responses to the evidence.

13.   Even if the judge did not have a copy  of  his  brother's  deportation
    appeal decision, that was said to mention relatives in his  country  of
    origin, it is not disputed that the appellant's  brother  was  deported
    and is currently living in Chile. The judge found the appellant evasive
    about his brother's whereabouts [37] but it was open to him to conclude
    that the appellant has relatives in his country of origin in  light  of
    his mother's evidence that she was still in contact  with  his  brother
    [24]. The judge acknowledged that  the  appellant  would  not  want  to
    return to his country of origin after such a long time but was entitled
    to conclude that the difficulties the appellant  would  face  were  not
    sufficiently serious to  amount  to  'very  significant  obstacles'  to
    reintegration given the fact that he has relatives in the  country  and
    has developed skills that would assist him to establish himself.

14.   Turning the judge's findings relating to  the  family  life  exception
    contained in paragraph 399(a) of the immigration rules. The judge found
    that it would be unduly harsh to expect L to live  in  the  country  to
    which  the  appellant  would  be  deported  [34].  However,  the  judge
    concluded that it would not be unduly harsh for L to remain in  the  UK
    without the appellant [35]. I accept that his findings  are  brief  and
    confined to a single paragraph. The judge considered the best interests
    of the child and was satisfied that it as  in  his  best  interests  to
    remain in the UK with his mother and stepfather. He considered that  it
    would be possible for L to maintain contact  with  his  father  through
    "modern methods of communication" and recognised that he didn't want to
    be separated from his father. However, the  judge  concluded  that  the
    circumstances did not meet the level required to show 'undue harshness'
    for the purpose of paragraph 399(a).

15.   I accept that the judge failed to make specific findings  relating  to
    certain factors that might have been relevant to an overall  assessment
    of whether separation from his father would be 'unduly harsh' on L.  He
    had clearly given evidence to say that he found it  difficult  when  he
    had reduced contact with his father while he was in  prison.  While  it
    appears that there is no dispute that  his  mother  has  at  some  time
    suffered from cancer, and that this was  no  doubt  a  frightening  and
    difficult time for L, there was nothing in  her  witness  statement  to
    indicate that she is currently suffering from  any  significant  health
    problems. She did not attend the hearing to give evidence. As the judge
    noted, L has always lived with his mother albeit that he has  also  had
    an ongoing relationship with his father.

16.   In MAB (para 399; "unduly harsh") USA [2015] UKUT 00435  the  Tribunal
    found that the assessment of whether the  consequences  of  deportation
    will be 'unduly harsh' involves a considerably  higher  threshold  than
    the   consequences   merely   being    "uncomfortable,    inconvenient,
    undesirable,  unwelcome  or  merely  difficult  and  challenging".  The
    consequence for an individual will be "harsh" if they are  "severe"  or
    "bleak" and they will be "unduly" so  if  they  are  "inordinately"  or
    "excessively" harsh taking into account all the  circumstances  of  the
    individual.

17.   In MM (Uganda) v  SSHD  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  617  the  Court  of  Appeal
    concluded that the assessment of whether deportation is 'unduly  harsh'
    on a child should  take  into  account  the  immigration  and  criminal
    history of the person who is to be deported.

18.   In the recent decision of SSHD v AJ (Zimbabwe) [2016]  EWCA  Civ  1012
    the Court of Appeal once again emphasised that it will be rare for  the
    best interests of the children to outweigh the strong  public  interest
    in  deporting  foreign  criminals.  Something  more  than   a   lengthy
    separation from a parent is required even if it  is  detrimental  to  a
    child's best interests. In a normal relationship of love and  affection
    between a parent and a child it will  nearly  always  be  in  the  best
    interests of a child for the relationship to continue  but  that  would
    not be sufficient to render deportation a disproportionate interference
    with family life. In order to override  the  high  public  interest  in
    deportation there must be additional features affecting the  nature  or
    quality of the relationship that are out of the ordinary.

19.   It is entirely understandable that L does not want his  father  to  be
    deported and is distressed by the prospect of separation. However, even
    if the judge had taken into account the additional  factors  identified
    by Ms Heybroek it is  highly  unlikely  that  the  judge,  if  properly
    directed on the law as set out above, would have come  to  a  different
    conclusion.

20.   L is 17 ï¿½ years old. He is nearly an adult  and  is  gradually  moving
    towards independence. He does not currently live in the  same  city  as
    his father but continues to have regular contact with him. The evidence
    relating to the compassionate circumstances  surrounding  his  mother's
    illness is a little vague but  there  is  no  suggestion  that  she  is
    currently unwell or requiring treatment.  While  it  is  understandable
    that neither L nor his father  want  to  be  separated,  this  must  be
    balanced against the appellant's criminal history. Although none of the
    offences cross the four-year threshold one cannot ignore the fact  that
    he has three  convictions  for  very  serious  offences  for  which  he
    received substantial sentences of imprisonment. He  also  has  a  large
    number of convictions. The appellant's history of violent offending was
    seen as an aggravating  factor  when  he  was  sentenced  on  the  last
    occasion. It was open to the First-tier Tribunal judge to conclude that
    his  criminal  record  "is  a  disgrace"  [36].  While   his   father's
    imprisonment no doubt affected L adversely, and his  deportation  would
    have  a  similar  adverse  effect,  both  arise  as  a  result  of  the
    appellant's history of criminal offending.

21.    Without  seeking  to  diminish  the  impact  of  deportation  on  the
    appellant's son, the evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
    reach the elevated threshold  required  to  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 399(a). The effect of his father's deportation is  likely  to
    be harsh, but even if the judge had taken into account  the  additional
    factors identified in the grounds, the circumstances did not reach  the
    threshold to show that it would be 'unduly harsh'. For these reasons  I
    conclude that the failure of the First-tier Tribunal judge to  evaluate
    some relevant factors was not likely to make any material difference to
    the outcome of the appeal with reference to  paragraph  399(a)  of  the
    immigration rules.

22.   It is clear that the judge made some factual errors in  the  decision.
    He wrongly referred to the appellant arriving in the UK when he was  10
    years old.  However,  this  is  unlikely  to  have  made  any  material
    difference to the outcome of the appeal because it is  clear  that  the
    judge  was  fully  aware  of  the  appellant's  significant  length  of
    residence in the UK and took it into account.  I also accept that  some
    parts of the decision recorded the  evidence  inaccurately.  The  judge
    recorded that L had "recurring chest problems" [17] but  later  in  the
    decision this error was clearly remedied by his summary of the evidence
    given by C, who said that he had to have part of his lung removed [21].
    Similarly, in his summary of the appellant's mother's  evidence  it  is
    asserted that he wrongly stated that L "came and went from her  house",
    when in fact it is C. Again, this is  remedied  in  the  judge's  later
    findings where he considered the correct situation [40].  I  find  that
    these errors are fairly minor and amount to  no  more  than  errors  in
    drafting. An overall reading of the decision makes quite clear that the
    judge  had  recorded  and  taken  into  account  the   correct   family
    circumstances. Any errors  are  unlikely  to  have  made  any  material
    difference to the outcome of the decision.

23.   The final argument put forward on behalf of the appellant is that  the
    judge failed to apply the correct test outlined in paragraph 398 of the
    immigration rules. The judge began by stating that the rules "emphasise
    the high public interest in deporting foreign criminals. In a  case  to
    which rules 399 and 399A do not apply, very compelling reasons will  be
    required if they are to constitute  "exceptional  circumstances"  which
    outweigh the public interest in deportation" [30]. He went on to make a
    proper self-direction with reference to relevant case law.

24.   The test outlined in paragraph 398 no  longer  includes  reference  to
    "exceptional circumstances" and  instead  refers  to  "very  compelling
    circumstances" over and above those described in paragraph 399 and 399A
    of the immigration rules. The change to the wording was  made  in  July
    2014 (HC 532). To that extent the judge's summary of the relevant  rule
    is outdated and incorrect. However, the rule was changed to reflect the
    wording used by the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2014] 1 WLR
    544, which the judge took into account.  In substance, the test remains
    the same. It  reflects  a  high  threshold  before  the  strong  public
    interest in deportation will be outweighed. Although the judge referred
    to the outdated version of the rules, in essence his application of the
    law was the same. His summary of the law was a little confused but made
    reference to the need to show "very compelling reasons".  I  find  that
    there is nothing to suggest that the judge applied the wrong  threshold
    to the facts of the case.

25.    In  so  far  as  the  grounds   seek   to   challenge   the   judge's
    proportionality assessment under paragraph 398 of the immigration rules
    I find that none  of  the  criticisms  of  the  decision  are  of  such
    significance that they would have made any material difference  to  the
    overall outcome of the appeal. The judge took  into  account  the  fact
    that the appellant had undertaken rehabilitation work in prison as well
    as the reduced risk assessment (nevertheless he is  still  assessed  as
    medium risk of serious harm) [41]. The judge was clearly aware  of  the
    significant length of time that the appellant had lived in the UK [40].
    He  considered  the  appellant's  relationship  with  his  mother   and
    acknowledged  that  she  had  health  problems  and  would   like   the
    appellant's continued support [40]. However, it was open to  the  judge
    to conclude that she would  continue  to  receive  support  from  other
    family members, most notably, from C, who it was said was  living  with
    her at the time [21 & 40]. Whether or not she was well enough to return
    to work was unlikely to be a sufficiently compelling  circumstances  to
    affect the outcome of the decision.

26.   Similarly, the judge  was  clearly  aware  of  the  fact  that  C  had
    respiratory problems and had part of his lung removed  [21].  While  he
    did not make specific findings in relation to C as part of his  overall
    assessment under paragraph 398, on the evidence, his circumstances were
    unlikely to be sufficiently compelling to make any material  difference
    to the outcome of the appeal. C is now an adult  who  would  appear  to
    have normal familial ties with his father. Although his health problems
    have no doubt been a concern to the family there was nothing before the
    judge to suggest that they were so severe that the appellant's presence
    is required, either to provide physical care,  or  that  the  appellant
    provides emotional support over and above that of normal  relationships
    between adult relatives in such circumstances. Indeed, it would  appear
    that C is well enough to be in a position to  provide  support  to  his
    grandmother.

27.   While I acknowledge that  some  aspects  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision can be subject to criticism, I find that none of  the  matters
    raised by the appellant are sufficient to conclude that the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision involved the making of material errors  of  law.  The
    fact that the appellant has been resident in the UK  for  most  of  his
    life and has established family and private life ties  here  was  taken
    into account. However, those ties had to be weighed against the  strong
    public interest in deportation in circumstances where the appellant has
    continued to  commit  serious  criminal  offences  in  the  UK.  It  is
    understandable that the appellant disagrees with the decision  but  the
    judge's findings were not outside a range of  reasonable  responses  to
    the evidence.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision did not  involve  the  making  of  material
    errors of law

The First-tier Tribunal decision shall stand
