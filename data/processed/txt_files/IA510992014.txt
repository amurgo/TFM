Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D. Clerke (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms R. Akther (Counsel instructed by Metrolaw
solicitors)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This matter comes before me for consideration as to  whether  or  not
       there is a material error of law in the decision promulgated  by  the
       First-tier Tribunal (Judge Mayall) on 27th April 2015  in  which  the
       Tribunal allowed the appeal on  immigration  grounds  having  decided
       that deportation was not justified on "imperative grounds  of  public
       security".

    2. For convenience I shall refer to the parties following the First-tier
       proceedings, although the appellant in this matter is  the  Secretary
       of State.

  Background

    3. The appellant is a citizen of Albania who  was  granted  a  permanent
       right of residence under the EEA Regulations, Regulation  15,  issued
       on 14.12.2011 valid  until  12.12.2021.   On  7th  October  2011  the
       appellant was convicted of harassment and  given  a  community  order
       with costs. On 25th June 2013 at Lewes Crown Court he  was  convicted
       and sentenced to 4 years imprisonment for two counts of conspiracy to
       supply and possession with intent to supply a class  A  drugs  namely
       cocaine [3 & 4].

    4. The Respondent made a decision to remove the appellant  in  a  letter
       dated  15.12.2014  relying  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy   in
       accordance  with  Regulation  19(3)(b)  and  Regulation  21  of   the
       Immigration  EEA  Regulations  2006  ("EEA  regs.").   The  appellant
       appealed under section 84 Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
       2002 (as amended) which allows the  decision  to  be  treated  as  an
       immigration decision by virtue of section regulation 26(7) EEA  Regs.
       This is not a deportation decision as such for the  purposes  of  the
       Immigration  Act  2014.   The  respondent  certified  under  the  new
       regulation 24AA that the appellant would not  face  a  real  risk  of
       serious irreversible harm if removed before  his  appeal  was  heard.
       The appellant was not present at the First-tier hearing  nor  at  the
       hearing before me and was not  granted  temporary  admission  despite
       having permanent residence.

       First-tier Tribunal decision

    5.  The  Tribunal  considered  the  EEA  regulations  and  in   applying
       Regulation 21 found that the appellant had lived  in  the  UK  for  a
       continuous period of 10 years in accordance with the EEA  regulations
       and that the Secretary of State could not justify his deportation  on
       the imperative grounds  of  public  security  (Regulation  21(4)  EEA
       regs).

       Grounds for permission

    6. The respondent contends that  the  Tribunal  erred  by  applying  the
       imperative grounds test which was not applicable as the appellant was
       not an EEA national.  There was no evidence that the EEA  Regulations
       were engaged prior to 2007.

       Permission to appeal

    7. Permission was granted on renewal by Upper Tribunal Judge  Grubb  who
       found that the Tribunal erred  in  law  by  applying  the  imperative
       public security test under  regulation  21(4)  EEA  regs  which  only
       applied to EEA nationals.  As a person  with  a  permanent  right  of
       residence the applicable test was "serious grounds".



Submisssions

    8. Mr Clerke relied on  the  grounds  of  the  application  and  further
       submitted that in the event of an error of law being found the  Upper
       Tribunal was able to remake the  decision  by  applying  the  correct
       rules to the findings made by the Tribunal as to risk and/or  Article
       8 ECHR in the event of  the  seriousness  test  being  met.   It  was
       conceded that the  appellant  established  a  family  life  with  his
       partner who was now pregnant with their baby due in early 2016.

    9. Ms Akhter agreed that there was an error in law by the Tribunal.  She
       submitted that the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier for  a
       hearing de novo as the appellant was  entitled  to  have  his  appeal
       determined with  reference  to  the  correct  rules  and  there  were
       significant changes in the circumstances as his partner was pregnant.
        His partner had visited the appellant in  Albania  no  less  that  8
       times. The situation had changed as there was now a  British  citizen
       child to be  considered.   Regulation  21(5)  required  an  extensive
       examination of the relevant issues.

Error of law decision

   10. I am  entirely  satisfied  that  the  Tribunal  materially  erred  in
       applying the test on imperative grounds under reg 21(4) which applies
       to EEA nationals only and therefore cannot apply to the appellant who
       is a citizen of Albania.

   11. I set aside the decision.

   12. In considering the options for further hearing  I  decided  that  the
       matter could be remade before the Upper  Tribunal  on  the  basis  of
       submissions and oral evidence from the appellant's partner Ms  C  who
       was at the hearing.  There was no real challenge as to  the  findings
       made by the First-tier Tribunal as to the seriousness of the offence.
        The Upper Tribunal was in a position to make an  assessment  of  the
       evidence by applying the  serious  grounds  test  and  if  applicable
       Article 8 ECHR.

Remaking the decision

Summary of oral evidence

   13. I heard evidence from the appellant's  partner  who  I  found  to  be
       entirely reliable.  I find that she is pregnant, her baby is  due  in
       early 2016 and the appellant is the father.  The appellant is  living
       in Albania  in  unsettled  circumstances  staying  with  friends  and
       relatives where there is space for him.  His partner has visited  him
       on at least  8  occasions  and  she  regards  their  relationship  as
       enduring and significant.  She has a strong family life in the UK and
       has  worked  hard  to  establish  a  good  career.   The  appellant's
       offending had had an enormous impact on her and the  appellant  while
       he was on bail, in prison and since he was returned to Albania.   She
       firmly believed that he would not re-offend. In cross examination  Ms
       C confirmed that the pregnancy was planned  and  the  baby  conceived
       after  the  appellant's  appeal  was   allowed   and   therefore   in
       circumstance where the couple believed the  appellant  would  not  be
       deported. Once the baby was born she would not be able to  travel  to
       Albania and it would be difficult for her and the baby to live  there
       because of the language barrier.

  Submissions

   14. Mr Clerke submitted that the offence was serious, a lengthy  term  of
       imprisonment was imposed and the  risk  of  re-offending  established
       that the criteria under regulation 21(5) of  a  present  and  serious
       risk were met.  The Tribunal found some ambiguity in the  appellant's
       response to his conviction to the extent that he appeared not to have
       accepted his guilt.  He relied on Badewa. The Tribunal  was  entitled
       to find the appellant at a medium risk of re offending. He relied  on
       public security and public policy.

   15. As to Article 8 family life the appellant's  partner  could  live  in
       Albania together with their baby.  It would not be unduly  harsh  for
       the family to settle in Albania. The Tribunal would have to  consider
       the public interest factors in s.117C of the 2002 Act.

   16. Ms Akhter submitted that the test of serious grounds had not been met
       in particular having regard to reg 21(5) (3).  The  OASys  assessment
       found  that  the  appellant  was  at  low  risk  to  the  public   of
       reoffending, and a medium risk to a named person.  The appellant  has
       a significant residence in the UK of 13 years where he has worked and
       established a strong family life. He came to the UK as a minor.

   17. The appellant was not a habitual offender and had served his time  in
       prison.  There was no offending between 2011  and  2013  and  he  was
       removed in December 2014.  The one offence albeit serious  could  not
       meet the test.   With  reference  to  the  provisions  there  was  no
       proportionality issue as the appellant served  his  prison  sentence,
       his partner has given credible evidence as to the impact and level of
       remorse, the OASys was reliable evidence as to risk and there was  no
       evidence of any on going risk.  The test was at a high level  because
       of permanent residence. He did  not  show  that  he  was  a  present,
       genuine, serious threat  to  public  security  or  on  public  policy
       grounds under 21(4)(c).

   18. Ms Akhter submitted that  the  circumstances  changed  now  that  the
       appellant was going to be a father.  He had family settled in the UK.
        It would be unduly harsh for the family life to  be  established  in
       Albania. His deportation would result in a 10 years ban from  the  UK
       which in the present circumstances was disproportionate.   Ms  Akhter
       relied on the same submissions in respect of Article 8.

  Discussion and decision

   19. In remaking the decision I observe that the appellant  did  not  give
       oral evidence at the First-tier hearing since his removal to  Albania
       was  certified  by  the  Secretary  of  State.  I  do  not  have  the
       certification decision but I am assuming that the Respondent took the
       view that because of the length of sentence (4 years) there  were  no
       operational reasons in existence to conclude that the appellant would
       not be suitable  for  certification,  notwithstanding  his  permanent
       residence in the UK. In any event the certification is not  a  matter
       for the Tribunal to adjudicate. I have the  benefit  of  his  witness
       statement and the oral evidence from his partner. It is  accepted  by
       the Secretary of State  that  the  appellant  was  granted  permanent
       residence and that he was exercising Treaty rights as a family member
       and since his divorce he had been self employed.  I  have  considered
       the relevant legal provisions under Regulation 21(3) & (5)  EEA  regs
       and decided that the appellant is entitled to the protection  at  the
       second level because it  has not been shown  that  he  "represents  a
       genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the
       fundamental interests of society."  I have had regard to the relevant
       criteria in the Regulations at 21(6) and conclude that  he  does  not
       present such a threat on grounds of public security or on the grounds
       of public policy.  Consequently there is  no  necessity  to  consider
       proportionality but in any event I conclude that the decision is  not
       proportionate. My reasons are as follows.

   20. I find that the appellant was convicted of two counts of very serious
       offences which involved conspiracy to and intent to supply a class  A
       drugs with a street value of �920.00 and the appellant was  sentenced
       to 4 years imprisonment.  On that basis  the  initial  threshold  for
       considering deportation is met  on  policy  grounds  because  of  the
       length of the sentence and that serious harm has been caused  to  the
       public by the supply of drugs.  However, having regard to the  length
       of residence, the grant of permanent residence and  my  finding  that
       the appellant has established a significant degree of integration  in
       the UK, I conclude that his  circumstances  meet  the  rationale  for
       protection from removal/deportation.

   21. In considering the matter I have taken into account the recent  Upper
       Tribunal decision of MC  (Essa  principles  recast)  Portugal  [2015]
       00520 UKUT (IAC) and Macnikaoski [2014]  UKUT  00567  (IAC)  and  the
       Court of Appeal in SSHD v Dumliaukas  &  ors  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  145.
       Where as in this instance the appellant has permanent residence and a
       high degree of integration is established, weight can be attached  to
       prospects of rehabilitation and comparisons can be  made  with  those
       prospect in the country of origin, namely Albania. There must also be
       a reasonable prospect of the  person  ceasing  to  commit  crime  not
       merely a possibility.  The Tribunal is to consider  relevant  factors
       including  family  ties,  accommodation,  education,   training   and
       employment, and any active membership of the community.

   22. I find that the appellant has  convictions  for  two  offences.   The
       first was for harassment of his former  partner  and  in  respect  of
       which he has been assessed as a medium  risk  of  re  offending  (see
       OASys report).  Having regard to the fact that he is now in a new and
       long term relationship I am satisfied that  the  risk  to  the  named
       individual of any further offences will have decreased.  I have taken
       into account that the  commission  of  the  second  offence  put  the
       appellant in breach of a 12 month community order.

   23. It is clear that there has been some increase  in  offending  by  the
       appellant, however, whilst in no way minimising the first offence,  I
       am satisfied that the Appellant cannot be shown to have escalated his
       level of criminality significantly on  the  grounds  that  the  first
       offence is of a very different nature. I am satisfied that the  index
       offence stands alone as a serious offence and the appellant is not  a
       persistent offender. It is a very serious offence as was reflected in
       the remarks made and sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.  There
       were no  direct  victims  however.   The  offence  was  committed  in
       December 2011 and he will remain on licence until June 2017.

   24. In considering risk I rely  on  the  OASys  report  as  the  relevant
       evidence and which places the appellant at a low  level  of  risk  of
       reoffending and low risk of serious harm.  Even though the First-tier
       Judge found a medium level of risk, that does not alter  my  decision
       or considerations.  There is  no  evidence  of  the  appellant  being
       involved in prolific offending  and  has  no  other  convictions  for
       possession or supply of  drugs  or  serious  violence.   He  has  not
       committed further offences and there is no evidence of  any  personal
       difficulties such as drug addiction which could influence his risk of
       re offending, although he was described as  a  "heavy  user"  by  the
       sentencing Judge.  The motive for the offences was personal financial
       gain.  In light of those risk factors, length of residence,  lack  of
       past or continuing offending in drugs, and  taken with the high level
       of family support  and  substantial  integration  in  the  UK,  I  am
       satisfied that there  is  a  reasonable  prospect  of  the  appellant
       ceasing to commit further crimes in the UK.  He has  family  support,
       accommodation with his partner  and  prospects  of  employment.   His
       partner is in an established career of 13 years which she intends  to
       progress in future.  The prospects of rehabilitation in  the  UK  are
       greater than in Albania where the  appellant  has  not  lived  for  a
       significant period of time. I accept also that he came to the UK when
       he was a minor and has spent his formative years in the UK.  I accept
       the evidence from Ms C that his life there is unsettled and he has no
       accommodation or support.

   25. I find that the appellant now aged 30 years, has worked in the UK for
       a number of years in regular employment in his own company and  as  a
       bricklayer.  There was no evidence to show that the job was  open  to
       him, but I am satisfied  that  he  would  be  able  to  find  similar
       employment in the UK. He has close family members in the UK including
       his  brother  and  other  family  members.   He  is  involved  in   a
       significant and long term relationship with his partner, who  herself
       has strong family support, and he is soon to become a father.  Whilst
       it was reasonable for the respondent to  raise  concerns  as  to  the
       decision to have a baby at this time when the circumstances could  be
       described as "precarious", I place less weight on that factor  having
       regard to the reliable evidence of Ms C.  She stated that they wanted
       to have a child together and that because the appellant had  won  his
       appeal it was reasonable for them to conclude that he  would  not  be
       deported.

   26. The evidence in the OASys report indicates that the appellant  gained
       the status of an enhanced prisoner  whilst  in  prison  and  did  not
       present any behavioural problems.  He engaged  with  the  educational
       department and the BICS course and worked in the prison  garden.   He
       was motivated to complete suitable courses but  no  suitable  courses
       were found. It is stated that  he  accepted  responsibility  for  the
       offending and that he recognised the wider impact on the community of
       his  offending.   I  place  weight  on  these  conclusions  and   the
       indication that the appellant was assessed as "very capable" in terms
       of his capacity to change and reduce offending, which is relevant  to
       the rehabilitation issue.

   27. As I have allowed the appeal under the immigration rules, it  is  not
       necessary for me to consider Article 8 ECHR.

Decision

   28. Accordingly I allow the appeal on Immigration grounds under  the  EEA
       Regulation 21.
