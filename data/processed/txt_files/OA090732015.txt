For the Appellant:     Mr M K Mustafa, Solicitor, Kalam Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant a national  of  Bangladesh  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  of  30th
    April 2015 to refuse her application for entry clearance as  a  partner
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Walters dismissed the appeal and the Appellant appeals to this Tribunal
    with permission granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Brunnen  on  19th
    September 2017.

 2. In the grounds and at the hearing before Mr  Mustafa  essentially  made
    two submissions.  It is firstly contended that the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge erred in his conclusions in relation to the number of visits made
    by the Sponsor to Bangladesh to visit the Appellant.  It  is  contended
    that the judge appears to have failed to take into  account  the  visit
    made by the Sponsor after the  date  of  the  ECO's  decision.   It  is
    secondly contended that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  appeared  to  be
    absorbed by the purported length or number of any visits and failed  to
    take into account the significant amount of other evidence put  forward
    in relation to the ongoing continuous nature of the marriage.

 3. Mr Bramble made no submissions.

Error of Law

 4. In  the  decision  the  judge  says  that  he  took  into  account  the
    Appellant's bundle [4].  However in his findings  the  judge  makes  no
    reference to the evidence of remittances set out at pages 64 to  93  of
    the bundle; the evidence of emails between the Appellant and Sponsor at
    pages 94 to 113; the phone  records  at  pages  114  to  136;  and  the
    photographs at pages 137 to 145 of the Appellant's bundle.

 5. Further, as submitted by Mr Mustafa, the Sponsor's passport was  before
    the judge showing a visit to Bangladesh in September 2015 and the judge
    appears not to have taken into account this second visit.

 6. The judge's failure to refer to any of that evidence  in  reaching  his
    conclusions amounts to a material error of law.

 7. Accordingly I find that the judge made  a  material  error  of  law  in
    failing to take account of relevant evidence before him and I  set  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

Re-Making the Decision

 8. I remake the decision on the basis of the evidence that was before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The unchallenged finding of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge at paragraph  15  is  that  the  Appellant  was  earning
    ï¿½18,720 per annum in the  twelve  months  preceding  the  date  of  the
    application.  In light of this unchallenged finding I am satisfied that
    the Appellant met  the  financial  requirements  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing.

 9. The Entry Clearance officer's refusal decision raises two other  issues
    under the Immigration Rules.

10. The first issue raised in the refusal decision is whether the Appellant
    made misleading representations in relation to  the  Sponsor's  ongoing
    employment and income. However, in light of the  unchallenged  findings
    at paragraphs 16 and 17 of the First-tier Tribunal's decision that  the
    Sponsor had continued working in the same restaurant but that only  the
    limited company owning the restaurant had changed, I  find  that  there
    was no material change in circumstances  in  the  Sponsor's  employment
    after the application was made. I find that it has not been established
    that misleading representations have  been  made  in  relation  to  the
    Sponsor's ongoing employment and income.

11. The other issue raised in the refusal notice is whether  the  Appellant
    met  the  relationship  requirements  and  can  demonstrate  that   the
    relationship is genuine and subsisting and that the  couple  intend  to
    live together permanently in the UK in  accordance  with  paragraph  E-
    ECP.2.6 & 2.10 of Appendix FM of the Rules.

12. In terms of the genuineness of the relationship I take into account the
    evidence in the Sponsor's witness statement as to the ongoing nature of
    the relationship.  I take into  account  the  evidence  of  remittances
    which show money  transfers  covering  a  period  from  March  2014  to
    November 2016 showing transfers from the Sponsor to the  Appellant.   I
    take into account the emails between  the  Sponsor  and  the  Appellant
    contained in the Appellant's bundle between pages 94 and 113.   I  take
    into account the  evidence  of  telephone  calls  as  set  out  in  the
    Sponsor's telephone bills from  2014,  2015  and  2016.   I  take  into
    account also the photographs of the couple together.   Considering  all
    of this evidence I accept that the Appellant has demonstrated that  her
    relationship with the Sponsor is genuine and subsisting.

13. In these circumstances the Appellant has demonstrated  that  she  meets
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The appeal before me is  on
    the basis of human rights only due to the  date  of  the  decision.  In
    light of the fact that the  Appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage with the Sponsor I am satisfied that she has a family life and
    that the decision to refuse entry clearance amounts to an  interference
    with her family  life.  In  considering  proportionality  I  take  into
    account  that  that  the  Appellant  has  shown  that  she  meets   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules. In these  circumstances  and  on
    the basis of all of the evidence before me I am satisfied that there is
    no public interest in maintaining the decision.

14. In light of all of the evidence before  me  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance is not proportionate to  the  public
    interest.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material error of law.

I set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
