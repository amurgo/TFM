                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Trevaskis, promulgated on 21st March 2018, following a hearing at
    Newport on  22nd  February  2018.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Permission to appeal was granted on 11th June 2018 and
    thus the matter comes before me today.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, and was born on  15th
    March 1984.  He appealed against the decision of the  Respondent  dated
    28th June 2017 refusing his application for leave to remain in  the  UK
    on the basis of his family and  private  life  under  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE.  The basis of the Appellant's application is that  he
    is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with a Miss [LP], a British
    citizen, settled in the UK, who  is  receiving  medical  care  in  this
    country, is in ill-health, and for whom the Appellant acts as a carer.

The Judge's Determination

 3. The  judge  heard  evidence  that  the  Appellant  "has  major  medical
    conditions, but no  confirmed  diagnosis".   There  was  also  evidence
    before the judge  that  the  Appellant's  partner  had  "major  medical
    conditions, but no confirmed diagnosis".  He heard evidence  that  "she
    is receiving chemotherapy treatment which is said to cost ï¿½73,000  each
    time.  If the Appellant returns to Bangladesh, she will  be  unable  to
    care for herself" (paragraph 13).  The judge also heard  evidence  that
    the Appellant "has been her carer since November 2015".  As far as  the
    Appellant's mother was concerned she "works full-time and cares for her
    grandson aged 11 who lives with her" (paragraph 13).

 4. The judge went on to say that he  found  both  the  Appellant  and  his
    partner to be "credible and reliable witnesses.  Their credibility  has
    not been damaged by cross-examination" (paragraph 22).  That being  the
    case, the  he  moved  on  to  a  consideration  of  whether  there  was
    "disproportionate interference with the right to  enjoy  a  family  and
    private life" (paragraph 23).  He went on to consider the  position  of
    the Appellant's partner and observed that she was  a  British  citizen,
    who was present and settled in the UK, and had no  previous  experience
    of life in Bangladesh or knowledge of its  language  and  culture.   He
    noted that "she also suffers from a combination of  medical  conditions
    for which she is  receiving  treatment  under  the  NHS;  she  is  also
    receiving a number of benefits relating to those conditions, and  lives
    in her own home" (paragraph 27).  The judge, importantly, also observed
    that "it is not disputed that the Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  have  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship akin to marriage" (paragraph 27).

 5. As far as the Appellant himself was concerned,  the  judge  noted  that
    there were obviously "no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  Appellant
    returning to Bangladesh".  He  could  continue  family  life  with  the
    Sponsor if the Appellant were to join him in Bangladesh but this  "will
    have significant detrimental consequences for the  Sponsor,  not  least
    the loss of access to NHS treatment, but no evidence has been presented
    to  show  that  treatment  for  her  conditions  is  not  available  in
    Bangladesh.

 6. The judge went on to then  make  his  decision  that,  based  upon  the
    evidence that had been presented to him, "I  am  satisfied  that  these
    difficulties will be very significant, but I am not satisfied that they
    could not be overcome, nor that they would entail very serious hardship
    for the Appellant" (paragraph 29).  That being so, the judge went on to
    dismiss the appeal.  He dismissed the  appeal  also  on  the  basis  of
    Article 8 ECHR.  There was copious reference by the judge to  case  law
    that was applicable in relation to Article 8 rights (see pages 6  to  9
    of the determination).

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that it  was  not  disputed  that  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor were in a genuine and subsisting relationship
    that was akin to marriage (paragraph 27).  The judge had also found the
    Appellant and the Sponsor to be both credible witnesses (paragraph 22).
     It was recognised that the Sponsor suffered  from  medical  conditions
    and received benefits  and  lived  in  her  own  home  (paragraph  27).
    However, the judge had then irrationally concluded  that  the  test  in
    EX.1 was not met.  That was perverse in the light of the findings  that
    the judge had made.  It was contrary to the Respondent's own  published
    guidance.  The guidance given by the Supreme Court  in  Agyarko  [2017]
    UKSC 11, was also not properly followed.

 8. On 11th June 2018, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 21st September 2018, Mr I  Khan,  appearing
    as Counsel on behalf of the Appellant succinctly and  pointedly  stated
    that the area where the judge had gone wrong was in failing  to  follow
    the guidance that was given in Agyarko (see paragraph 7 of the  grounds
    of application).  This is because there the Supreme Court had  referred
    to the fact that there is a distinction to  be  drawn  between  a  case
    where a  person  is  automatically  deported  as  a  foreign  criminal,
    (because the weight of public interest in that case would then be  very
    considerable); and the distinction to be drawn with  a  case  where  an
    Appellant is simply residing in the UK  unlawfully,  but  is  otherwise
    certain to be granted leave to enter, at least if an  application  were
    made from outside the UK,  because  "then  there  might  be  no  public
    interest in his or her removal" (paragraph 51).  Had the judge focussed
    on this, and given what the findings of the judge had been in  relation
    to the position of the Sponsor, [LP], and  the  Appellant,  the  appeal
    would have fallen to be allowed.

10. For her part, Ms Vidyadharan submitted that  the  judge  could  not  be
    faulted  for  having  come  to  the   conclusion   that   the   balance
    considerations fell against the  Appellant  for  two  reasons.   First,
    although the judge  had  accepted  that  were  the  Sponsor  to  go  to
    Bangladesh with the Appellant, this "will have significant  detrimental
    consequences for the Sponsor", the entirety of that sentence ended with
    the words that, "but no  evidence  has  been  presented  to  show  that
    treatment for her condition is not available in Bangladesh"  (paragraph
    28).  Ms  Vidyadharan  submitted  that  the  plain  fact  was  that  no
    enquiries had been made about what was available in  terms  of  medical
    treatment in Bangladesh.  Indeed, the judge had gone on to  say  "there
    appeared to  have  been  no  enquiries  made  regarding  her  potential
    relocation to Bangladesh" (paragraph 28).  Secondly, she submitted that
    if one does  indeed  look  at  paragraph  51  of  Agyarko,  although  a
    distinction is drawn between the position with respect to a person  who
    is automatically deported as a foreign criminal, and others,  that  was
    not to say that all such cases  fell  to  be  allowed,  which  did  not
    involve the deportation of a foreign criminal.  In this case,  had  the
    evidence existed of the  availability  or  otherwise  of  treatment  in
    Bangladesh for [LP], the judge may well have  come  to  the  conclusion
    that the removal of the Appellant was disproportionate to their  family
    life interests.

Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the judge did involve
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

12. First, it is plain that in relation to the core findings that the judge
    has made, that the Appellant and  the  sponsoring  partner  were  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship, whereby the Appellant  was  caring
    for the Appellant, and the judge observes that "before  he  became  the
    carer for his wife, she was cared for by her mother.  His  wife  cannot
    go to Bangladesh because she  does  not  speak  Bengali  and  does  not
    understand the culture; there is no gas or electricity  in  Bangladesh"
    (paragraph 9).  Whereas it may indeed be the case that criticism of the
    unavailability of gas or electricity in Bangladesh is  overstated,  the
    fact remains that [LP] has  not  ever  been  to  Bangladesh,  does  not
    understand its culture, and is not inclined to go there.  That was  the
    evidence before the judge.   The  judge  did  not  disagree  with  that
    evidence.  This means that the situation was not confined simply to the
    availability or otherwise of medical treatment.  It was to do with  the
    circumstances of the Appellant's  sponsoring  partner  herself.   Those
    circumstances are that the sponsoring partner has her mother,  brother,
    sister and uncle in this country.  Her close family members are all  in
    this country.  She made it clear that she was not  going  to  accompany
    the Appellant in Bangladesh.

13. Secondly, the Appellant's partner was receiving chemotherapy treatment,
    which was costing ï¿½73,000 each time, and the delicacy of that treatment
    meant that the Sponsor was in any event reluctant to give that  up,  as
    the judge clearly  recognised,  and  accompany  her  carer  partner  to
    Bangladesh.  In the circumstances, paragraph 51 of Agyarko is  relevant
    to the extent that it does  make  it  clear  that  if  otherwise  entry
    clearance is certain to be granted for leave to enter, then there might
    be  no  public  interest  in  the  Appellant's  removal.   That  was  a
    conclusion that the judge may well have come to had it not been for the
    fact that he was side tracked into  a  consideration  of  no  enquiries
    having been made in Bangladesh about  the  availability  of  treatment,
    which was not the sole issue before the judge.

Remaking the Decision

14. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons that I have  set  out
    above.  I should also add that what is clear in  Agyarko  is  that  the
    established case law on Article 8 is such that  the  ultimate  question
    has to be how a fair balance should be  struck  between  the  competing
    public and individual interests involved,  applying  a  proportionality
    test.  In Agyarko the court made clear that

         "The Secretary of State has not imposed a test  of  exceptionality,
         in the sense which Lord Bingham had in  mind:  that  is  to  say  a
         requirement that  the  case  should  exhibit  some  highly  unusual
         feature,  over  and  above  the  application   of   the   test   of
         proportionality.   On  the  contrary,  she  has  defined  the  word
         'exceptional', as already explained, as meaning  'circumstances  in
         which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for
         the individual such that the refusal of the application  would  not
         be proportionate'" see paragraph 60).

    I find that this is a case that  where  there  would  be  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences for the Appellant and his right to  family  life  in
    this case were he to be removed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is allowed.

No anonymity direction is made.

I allow the appeal.

payable.
