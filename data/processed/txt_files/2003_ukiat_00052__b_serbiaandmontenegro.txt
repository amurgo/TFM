|DETERMINATION AND REASONS                                                 |

Representation:

For the Secretary of State:  Ms. J.  Webb,  Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
                        Officer.
For the Respondent:          Mr. F.  Kodagoda,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by
                        Simmons Solicitors.

1.    Mr. B (who we shall hereafter refer to as the Claimant) is  a  citizen
     of Serbia and Montenegro  (formerly  called  the  Federal  Republic  of
     Yugoslavia), aged about 44  years.  He  is  an  ethnic  Albanian,  from
     Kosovo. He entered the United Kingdom illegally on 20th August 1997 and
     claimed asylum on the same day. On 25th June  2000,  the  Secretary  of
     State decided to refuse his asylum claim and to  issue  directions  for
     his removal to Kosovo, for the reasons given in  the  "refusal  letter"
     dated 20th May 2000. The Secretary of State  certified  the  Claimant's
     asylum claim under paragraph 5(4)(b) of Schedule 2 of the 1993 Act  and
     further certified that his asylum claim was not one to which  paragraph
     5(5) of Schedule 2 of that Act applied. The Claimant  appealed  against
     that decision under Section 8(4) of the Asylum and Immigration  Appeals
     Act 1993 (as amended) (the 1993 Act).

2.    The Claimant's appeal was heard on 24th February 2003 before Mr.  H  H
     R Crawshay, an Adjudicator. The Adjudicator  dismissed  the  appeal  on
     asylum grounds but purported  to  allow  the  appeal  on  human  rights
     grounds (Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention for  the  Protection
     of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR)). The  Adjudicator  did
     not agree with the opinion expressed in the certificate. Accordingly, a
     right of appeal lies to the Tribunal.

3.    Leave  to  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  was  granted  because  the  Vice
     President granting leave considered that the grounds of appeal raised a
     properly arguable issue of  law.  In  the  grounds  of  appeal,  it  is
     asserted that, given that the decision of the Secretary  of  State  was
     made on 25th June 2000, the Adjudicator did not  have  jurisdiction  to
     consider any human rights issues. It is asserted that the appeal before
     the Adjudicator  related  to  the  Claimant's  asylum  claim.  In  this
     connection, reliance was placed on the Tribunal's Starred Determination
     in Selvaratnam Pardeepan v. SSHD (00/TH/2414).

4.    At the hearing before us, Mr. Kodagoda sought to persuade us that  the
     Adjudicator did have jurisdiction to consider the human  rights  issues
     which appeared relevant on the evidence which was before him.  In  this
     respect, Mr. Kodagoda relied on the following:

      (i)   The appeal before the Adjudicator was heard at a time  when  the
           Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act)  was
           in force. The overriding objective of the 2002 Act is to achieve
           the speedy and fair  disposal  of  appeals  against  immigration
           decisions.

      (ii)  The Adjudicator had before him a statement  from  the  Claimant,
           which  the  Claimant  adopted  at  the  hearing.  Mr.   Kodagoda
           submitted that this statement was a statement within the meaning
           of Section 120 of the 2002 Act. In paragraphs 6, 11  and  12  of
           his statement,  the  Claimant  referred  to  matters  which,  in
           effect, meant that Article 8 was  being  relied  upon,  although
           Article 8 was not in fact specifically mentioned.

      (iii) If it was accepted that the Claimant's statement was  a  Section
           120  statement,  then  (Mr.  Kodagoda  submitted),   under   the
           provisions of Section 85(2) of the 2002 Act, the Adjudicator was
           obliged  to  consider  any  matters  raised  in  the  Claimant's
           statement which constitute a ground of appeal of a  kind  listed
           in Section 84(1) against the decision appealed against.  Section
           84(1) permits an appeal to be brought on human  rights  grounds.
           Furthermore, Section 85(3) of the 2002 Act states  that  Section
           82(2) applies to a statement made under Section 120 whether  the
           statement was made before or after  the  appeal  was  commenced.
           Section 85(4) permits the Adjudicator to consider evidence about
           any matter which he thinks relevant  to  the  substance  of  the
           decision, including evidence which  concerns  a  matter  arising
           after the date of the decision.

      (iv)  If we found that there was any ambiguity in  the  interpretation
           of the 2002 Act, then Mr. Kodagoda submitted that  we  ought  to
           apply the principle that a statute should be construed so as  to
           advance a remedy, rather than suppress a remedy.

5.    In reply, Ms. Webb relied simply on the grounds of application.

6.1   We had not had any prior notice of the  argument  which  Mr.  Kodagoda
     advanced before us. This is not intended to be a criticism, but  simply
     a statement of fact. However, as a consequence, we only  had  available
     at the hearing a draft of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
     2002  (Commencement  No.  4)  Order  2003,  made  on  14th  March  2003
     (hereafter referred to as the Commencement Order).

6.2   We referred Mr. Kodagoda to articles 2 and  3  of  the  draft  of  the
     Commencement Order. Mr. Kodagoda appeared to accept that the effect  of
     these provisions was that the 2002 Act had no application to the appeal
     before us. However, we reserved our  determination,  as  we  wished  to
     check the published version of the Commencement Order.

6.3   We have since  obtained  a  copy  of  the  published  version  of  the
     Commencement Order (Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 754 (C. 37)).  Having
     considered this and Mr. Kodagoda's  submissions,  we  have  decided  to
     allow the Secretary of State's appeal. We now give our reasons.

7.1   Under article 2 and Schedule 2 of  the  Commencement  Order,  Sections
     82, 84, 85 and 120 came into effect on 1st April 2003.   This  disposes
     of Mr. Kodagoda's first argument (see paragraph 4.(i)  above),  because
     the appeal before the Adjudicator was heard on  24th  February  2003  -
     that is, before the 2002 Act came into force.

7.2   Furthermore, Articles 3 and 4 of the Commencement  Order  (so  far  as
     relevant) provide as follows:

      3.    (1)  Subject to Schedule 2, the new appeals provisions  are  not
             to have effect in relation to events which took  place  before
             1st April  2003  and,  notwithstanding  their  repeal  by  the
             provisions of the 2002 Act commenced by this  Order,  the  old
             appeals provisions are to continue to have effect in  relation
             to such events.

      4.    (1)  In this Order -

                 (a)   "the new appeals provisions" means sections 82 to  99
                 and sections 101 to 103 of  the  2002  Act;  together  with
                 .........

                 (b)   "the old appeals provisions" means -
                       (i)   .......
                       (ii)  subsections (1) to (4)  of  section  8  of  the
                 1993 Act; .......

                 (c)   "the old Immigration Acts" means the  1971  Act,  the
                 1988 Act, the 1993 Act, the 1996 Act, the 1997 Act and  the
                 1999 Act, all without the amendments made by the 2002 Act.

            (3)  For the purposes of article 3 and Schedule 2, an event  has
             taken place under the old Immigration Acts where -

                 (a)   a notice has been served;
                 (b)   a decision was made or taken;
                 (c)   directions were given; and
                 (d)   a certificate was issued.

            (4)  For the purposes of this Order -

                 (a)   a notice was served;
                 (b)   a decision was made or taken;
                 (c)   directions were given; and
                 (d)   a certificate was issued
                 on the day on which it was or they were sent to the  person
             concerned ............

7.3   We noted that article 3(1) is subject to Schedule  2.  However,  there
     is no reference in Schedule 2 of the Commencement Order to Sections 84,
     85 and 120 relied upon by Mr. Kodagoda. Accordingly, we considered that
     the general principle in article 3(1) applies to this appeal.

7.3   Article 3(1) clearly states that, in relation to  "events  which  took
     place before 1st April 2003", the "new appeals provisions" (defined  to
     include Sections 84 and 85 on which Mr. Kodagoda relied)  were  not  to
     have effect and that the "old appeals provisions" (defined  to  include
     Section 8(4) of the 1993 Act, under  which  the  Claimant  brought  his
     appeal) were to continue to have effect. It is clear, from article 4(3)
     and (4) that the Claimant's appeal is an "event which took place before
     1st April 2003".

7.4   Accordingly, it is clear, from all of these provisions, that the  2002
     Act did not confer on the Adjudicator a human rights  jurisdiction  and
     that, under the principle enunciated in Pardeepan, his jurisdiction was
     limited to considering whether  the  Claimant's  removal  would  be  in
     breach of the obligations of  the  United  Kingdom  under  the  Refugee
     Convention. We consider that there is no ambiguity and no scope for the
     application of the principle which Mr. Kodagoda urged us to apply  (see
     paragraph 4(iv) above).

8.    Finally, we  note  that  the  Adjudicator  listed  the  names  of  the
     Claimant's dependants on the front cover sheet of his Determination  as
     Appellants. This is misleading, as it is clear, from the appeal papers,
     that the Claimant's wife and children only claim as his dependants  and
     do not have separate appeals.

      Decision

      The appeal of the Secretary of State is ALLOWED.
