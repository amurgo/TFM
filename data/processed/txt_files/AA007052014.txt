                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Madeleine Colvin), sitting at Taylor House on 4  March,
    to  an appeal on article 8 human rights grounds only by  a  citizen  of
    Albania, born 9 May 1974. Permission  was  granted  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, on the basis that the judge had not followed Gulshan (Article
    8 - new Rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).

 2. The appellant arrived here and claimed asylum in 1997:  on  21  October
    that year his  claim  was  refused  because  he  had  not  attended  an
    interview on  3  October,  of  which  he  says  he  had  been  unaware.
    Eventually his appeal against that decision was listed for  hearing  on
    14 October 1998; but he got lost and  went  to  the  wrong  court.  The
    appeal was adjourned to 15 December, and  he  says  he  relied  on  his
    solicitor, who had told him he would attend on his behalf; but later he
    heard that the appeal had been treated as abandoned.

 3. That decision was issued on 18 January 1999.  The  next  heard  of  the
    appellant was in a letter from his then solicitors, Howe & Co, dated  8
    December that year, in which they said he  had  attended  their  office
    that day "... completely  confused  and  wishes  to  instruct  us  once
    again": apparently they had referred him to the  Refugee  Legal  Centre
    for representation on his appeal. The  letter  was  sent  to  the  Home
    Office, the wrong place for the request it  made,  which  was  for  the
    decision to be 'repromulgated', apparently so that the appellant  could
    appeal it. It was followed by a reminder on 21 December 1999; but  that
    was all.

 4. The appellant said he went to see his solicitors many times to see what
    was happening; but they said they were waiting for  a  reply  from  the
    Home Office.  The judge accepted that he never went 'underground';  but
    she herself found (see paragraph 23) that he  did  nothing  to  get  in
    touch with the Home Office between December  1999  and  2009,  when  he
    applied for and received a certificate of  approval  for  his  proposed
    marriage to a Bulgarian citizen, from whom he has since parted company.
    Then, for some reason best known to the Home Office, they wrote to  him
    in August 2010, to tell him that his asylum claim, which in reality had
    been refused, and his appeal against refusal treated as abandoned,  was
    being considered under the  'legacy  programme'.  The  result  of  that
    consideration came by way of the decision under appeal, on  16  January
    2014. Nothing need be said about the asylum part of the decision, since
    even before the judge the appeal was not pursued  on  that  point,  but
    only on article 8.

 5. So far as the 'new Rules' (in force from 9 July 2012) side of article 8
    is concerned, the judge found, for reasons she gave, that the appellant
    did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE. The first  paragraph
    of the Home Office grounds of appeal  (they  should  number  them  like
    everyone else) challenges the rest of her decision, in what  appear  to
    be standard terms, for failing to follow the guidance in  Nagre  [2013]
    EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan. However this was misconceived; though the
    judge did not make any reference to these authorities, so well known by
    now that this was quite unnecessary, she certainly  asked  herself  the
    question which they appear to pose in what she went on to say:

       It seems to me that there are sufficiently  compelling  circumstances
       in this case not recognized in the new Immigration  Rule  on  private
       life so as to justify a consideration of Article 8 more generally.

 6. There are two real issues in this case:

     a) Mr Jarvis's second ground of appeal: apart from a challenge, on the
        authorities, to the way in which the judge dealt with the  question
        of delay by the Home Office, this amounted to a submission that  no
        reasonable judge, properly directed, could have  found  that  there
        were "...sufficiently compelling circumstances in this case ...  to
        justify a consideration of Article 8 more generally"; and

     b) an argument by Mr Harding to the effect that the  judge  had  asked
        herself the wrong question after all, and was perfectly entitled to
        go on to a free-standing consideration of article 8 as a matter  of
        general principle. This should have been put forward by  way  of  a
        respondent's notice ('r. 24 response'); but, as it involved a  pure
        question of law, governed by recent and well-known  authorities,  I
        let him pursue it all the same.

 7. It makes sense to deal with (b) first, since, if Mr  Harding  is  right
    about it, (a) will not arise. His main point was that both Gulshan  and
    Nagre had been decided on the basis that E-LTRP, the applicable part of
    appendix FM under the 'new Rules',  contained a reference to article 8,
    and so formed a 'complete code' in the  sense  given  in  MF  (Nigeria)
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192. Looking at  E-LTRP,  it  is  necessary  first  to
    consider GEN. 1.1, which might be called the preamble to FM as a whole:

       This route is for those seeking to enter or remain in the UK  on  the
       basis of their family life with a person who is a British Citizen, is
       settled in the UK, or is in the UK with limited leave as a refugee or
       person granted humanitarian protection (and the applicant cannot seek
       leave to enter or remain in the UK as their family member under  Part
       11 of these rules). It sets out the requirements to be  met  and,  in
       considering applications under this route,  it  reflects  how,  under
       Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, the balance will be  struck
       ...

 8. Clearly GEN. 1.1 was intended to incorporate article 8 for  immigration
    purposes: the other side of Mr Harding's argument was that this was not
    the case with 276ADE, so I shall turn to that: it begins simply

       (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave  to  remain
       on the grounds of private life in the UK are  that  at  the  date  of
       application ...

    While there is no such explicit reference to article 8 as in GEN.  1.1,
    as I suggested to Mr Harding in the course of argument, it is  hard  to
    see what 'private life' could possibly mean in this context, and in the
    context of the following Rules dealing with leave  to  remain  on  that
    basis, other than the 'private life', the right to which  is  enshrined
    in article 8.

 9. Though this point may seem clear enough, without  further  analysis  of
    the Rules, Mr Jarvis referred me to the very  recent  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ  558,  so  I  shall  see
    whether it sheds any further light on it. The scenario  in  Haleemudeen
    was as follows: the first-tier judge had allowed his appeal on  what  I
    shall call a straight-8 basis. The first question before the Court  was
    whether the deputy Upper Tribunal judge had been correct in ruling that
    it had been wrong in law to do so. This was  answered  by  Beatson  LJ,
    effectively for the Court, at paragraph 40:

       I, however, consider that the FTT Judge did err in  his  approach  to
       Article 8. This is because he did not consider Mr. Haleemudeen's case
       for remaining in the United Kingdom on the basis of his  private  and
       family life against the Secretary of State's policy as  contained  in
       Appendix FM and Rule 276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  These  new
       provisions in the  Immigration  Rules  are  a  central  part  of  the
       legislative and policy context in which the interests of  immigration
       control are balanced against the interests and rights of  people  who
       have come to this country and wish  to  settle  in  it.  Overall  the
       Secretary of State's policy  as  to  when  an  interference  with  an
       Article  8  right  will  be  regarded  as  disproportionate  is  more
       particularised in the new Rules than it had previously been.

10. In my judgment, that passage, read as a whole, makes the answer to this
    question crystal clear. The whole of the 'new Rules', or at least,  for
    the purposes of Haleemudeen, appendix FM read with paragraph 276ADE, is
    to be read as a complete code, whose purpose is to clarify the approach
    to be taken to article 8, so far as immigration cases are concerned.

11. It follows that there is nothing in  Mr  Harding's  argument,  and  the
    judge was quite right to ask herself whether there were any 'compelling
    circumstances' which justified open-ended consideration of  article  8.
    The remaining questions are first, whether she took the right  approach
    on the authorities to the question of Home Office  delay;  and  second,
    whether,  on  the  correct  basis,  her  answer  to   the   'compelling
    circumstances' question was one open to a reasonable judge on the facts
    before her.

12. The question of Home Office delay was central to the judge's  treatment
    of the 'compelling circumstances' question: at paragraph  26  she  said
    this:

       It is the nature of how the appellant has been treated  by  the  Home
       Office during his lengthy stay of  17�  years  in  the  UK.  ...  the
       appellant brought himself to the attention of the Home Office  during
       his long stay in the UK ... the Home Office permitted him to marry an
       EEA national during this period and then later informed  him  he  was
       being considered under the Legacy programme which took a  further  3�
       years to resolve. At no time did the respondent attempt to remove the
       appellant during this period.

13. Mr Jarvis's delay point was based on AZ (Bangladesh)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ
    158. That appellant claimed to have arrived here in 1995, when he would
    have been 14�; he did nothing to  regularize  his  position  till  June
    2004, when he  asked  for  leave  to  remain,  which  the  Home  Office
    eventually refused in April 2007: the remaining 21 months  or  so  were
    taken up with the appeal process. As Scott  Baker  LJ  pointed  out  at
    paragraph 22

       Even if one excludes the first period  of  approaching  nearly  three
       years when he was a minor, there was still a period of six years when
       he remained in this country with absolutely no right to be  here  and
       made no attempt to regularise his position.

14. At 23 Scott Baker LJ went on to refer to the well-known  principles  in
    EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41; but he concluded

       The only culpable delay [by] the respondent ..., if indeed it can  be
       categorised as culpable delay, is in relation to the three-and-a-half
       year period [it was  about  2�  years;  but  this  was  an  extempore
       judgment] that it took  the  Secretary  of  State  to  determine  the
       application. That period is small, and indeed very small compared  to
       the earlier period  that  had  already  passed  since  the  appellant
       arrived in this country. In my judgment this  is  not  a  case  where
       anything has happened that has caused the appellant to lose  a  right
       during a period of delay by the Secretary of  State  or  whereby  his
       position has been in any way prejudiced by some intervening event.

15. There was little Mr Harding could say in  answer  to  that,  except  to
    point out the obvious, but in my view  less  than  crucial  differences
    between the facts of this case and AZ's. Reviewing them, this appellant
    had been grown up when he came here at 23: he did  claim  asylum  then,
    but, after his appeal against refusal was  treated  as  abandoned,  for
    reasons which may or may not have been his fault or the  fault  of  his
    solicitors, he had full knowledge of that judicial decision against him
    from December  1999  at  latest.  His  then  solicitors,  a  well-known
    experienced specialized  firm,  then  made  a  request,  in  the  wrong
    quarter, for it to be 'repromulgated': a mistake for which he cannot be
    blamed. However, after one reminder later that month, neither they  nor
    he did anything at all towards  regularizing  his  immigration  status,
    till April 2009, over nine years later.

16. In April 2009 the appellant applied under the procedure then  in  force
    for a certificate of approval for his forthcoming marriage,  which  was
    granted. That at least brought him to the further attention of the Home
    Office, and may have resulted in their letter of August  2010,  telling
    him he was being considered under the 'legacy programme'. Unaccountable
    as that step may seem, when there was a judicial decision against  him,
    which had stood for the last ten years; and  still  more  unaccountable
    the further 3� years it took for the Home Office  to  reach  their  own
    final decision, nothing  in  that  delay  prejudiced  this  appellant's
    interests any more than a similar one had done those of AZ.  Nor  could
    his own delay in doing anything about his  situation  between  December
    1999 and April 2009 be left out of account.

17. The Home Office delay, such as it was, clearly formed, at paragraph 26,
    the  main  basis  for  the  judge's   decision   on   the   'compelling
    circumstances' point; and the way in which she took it into account was
    clearly wrong in law,  for  the  reasons  just  given.  The  judge  did
    consider further points in the  appellant's  favour  at  paragraph  27,
    which she summarized in terms of his  having  "an  extensive  and  rich
    private life in the UK". He has worked hard, and is regarded as  honest
    and trustworthy, with many friends, some of whom have helped to support
    him. He could have applied for a residence card on  the  basis  of  his
    marriage to the Bulgarian lady, while that was still going, but  hadn't
    thought that right for some reason.

18. All of these, apart perhaps from the last, were certainly  points  more
    or less in the appellant's favour: Mr Jarvis argued the contrary in the
    case of the appellant's work record, on the  basis  of  what  was  said
    about unlawful working  in  ZS  (Jamaica)  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1639,  at
    paragraph 27. However, whether or not that is taken as a point  against
    the appellant, neither his hard-working nature, nor any  of  the  other
    points referred to by the judge at paragraph  27  could  possibly  have
    been regarded by any  reasonable  judge  as  amounting  to  'compelling
    circumstances', without what she said, wrongly as it turns  out,  about
    delay at paragraph 26. It follows that her  decision  as  a  whole  was
    wrong in law, and, as  Mr  Harding  realistically  conceded,  the  only
    logical consequence of that in this case is that it must be reversed.
