                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction:


 1. There was no appearance by or on behalf of the appellant on the hearing
    day, at 10.00 am. nor by 12 noon. The Upper Tribunal received a  letter
    dated 30 November 2016 from Chancery  CS  Solicitors,  the  appellant's
    representatives, which confirmed that they had received their  client's
    instructions that his case should be dealt with on the papers and that,
    accordingly, they would not be attending the hearing.  Having regard to
    the overriding objective and in view of the contents of the  letter,  I
    decided to exercise my discretion to proceed with the  hearing  in  the
    absence of the appellant.

 2. The appellant, a national of Nigeria born on  7  July  1985,   appeals,
    with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Robison promulgated on 8 July 2016 by which  he  dismissed  his  appeal
    against a decision of the respondent of  25  March  2016  refusing  his
    application of 4 August 2015 for a residence card under the Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("EEA Regulations") as confirmation of his right
    to reside in the United Kingdom  as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA  national
    exercising Treaty rights in the  United  Kingdom,  namely,  Ms  Claudia
    Vanessa Landim Tavares (the "sponsor"), a Portuguese national, born  on
    12 December 1993.

 3. The appellant and the sponsor were married in the United Kingdom on  27
    February 2015. The  respondent  refused  the  application  because  she
    considered that the marriage between the appellant and the sponsor  was
    a marriage of convenience.

 4. I will describe the respondent's reasons for her  decision  in  greater
    detail below. For the present, it is sufficient to say that the reasons
    include the fact that the appellant and the sponsor had not attended an
    interview on 16 February 2016 and an interview  on  3  March  2016.  In
    relation to the first interview, the appellant's explanation  was  that
    he and the sponsor had missed their train and that, upon the advice  of
    their solicitor who told them that they may not be interviewed if  they
    arrived late, he scanned the train ticket and  sent  the  scan  to  the
    respondent. In  relation  to  the  second  interview,  the  appellant's
    explanation was that he was "in a serious crisis". He  sent  a  medical
    report to the  respondent.   The  medical  report  in  question  was  a
    psychiatric report dated 23  February  2016  from  a  Dr  Krishnapillai
    Balasubramaniam, M.B; B.S.  (Cey),  L.R.C.P.  (Lond),  M.R.C.S.  (Eng),
    F.R.C, Psych (U.K.).

 5. Dr. Balasubramaniam had examined the appellant on 22 February 2016  and
    diagnosed him as suffering from a Depressive Disorder, linked, in part,
    to  his  immigration  status.  Dr.  Balasubramaniam   said   that   the
    appellant's condition was likely to worsen if  his  application  for  a
    residence card was refused (paras 9 and 10 of the medical  report).  He
    noted that the appellant had not reported his  depressive  symptoms  to
    his GP so far. He had advised the appellant  to  discuss  his  symptoms
    with his GP who he said should be able  to  treat  him  with  an  anti-
    depressant. He said that the  appellant  would  need  treatment  for  a
    period of 12 months to get better  (para  9).  He  said  that,  in  his
    opinion, the appellant was unfit to be interviewed in his current state
    and that his fitness was likely to improve  3  weeks  after  commencing
    anti-depressant treatment. Dr. Balasubramaniam considered that  it  was
    not possible to predict the appellant's risk of suicide  but  that,  as
    the appellant had thought about suicide, this increased the  risk.  Dr.
    Balasubramaniam  stated  that  this  risk  will  be  reduced   if   his
    application for a residence card was successful (para 8).

 6. The judge  decided  the  appellant's  appeal  on  the  papers,  as  the
    appellant had requested. At para 18 of his decision, the judge said:

            "It should  be  noted  that  although  this  medical  report  is
             referred to, there was no medical report in the file of  papers
             lodged in support of the appeal, and therefore I have  required
             to determine this appeal without the benefit of that document."



 7. Whilst it may be that the appellant's bundle did not contain a copy  of
    the report of Dr. Balasubramaniam, the respondent's bundle did.  It  is
    clear from para 18 of his decision that the judge did not consider  the
    psychiatric report at all.

 8. In these circumstances, Mr Kotas accepted that the judge had materially
    erred in law by failing to take into account a relevant document.

 9. I am satisfied that the judge materially erred in  law  by  failing  to
    take into account  relevant  evidence,  namely,  the  contents  of  the
    psychiatric report. I set aside his decision and proceeded  to  re-make
    the decision on the appellant's appeal. I decided to do so on the  same
    occasion for the following reasons:

    i.      Directions had been issued by the Upper Tribunal to the parties
          stating that, there is a presumption that, in  the  event  of  the
          Tribunal deciding that the decision of the FtT is to be set  aside
          as erroneous in law, the re-making of the decision will take place
          at the same hearing and the fresh decision will normally be  based
          on the evidence before the FtT.

    ii.     The directions go on to make it clear that any party wishing to
          rely upon evidence that was not before the FtT  must  comply  with
          rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.



    iii.    If he wishes to rely upon such evidence, the appellant has  not
          complied with rule 15(2A).

    iv.     In these circumstances, I decided to  proceed  to  re-make  the
          decision on the same occasion.

10. I heard briefly from Mr Kotas and then reserved my decision.

Assessment

11. Where an applicant seeks an EEA residence card on the basis that he  is
    married to an EEA national, he  simply  has  to  produce  his  marriage
    certificate and his spouse's passport. If the Secretary of State wishes
    to refuse to issue the residence card on the basis  that  the  marriage
    was one of convenience, she bears the burden of proving, to  the  civil
    standard, that the marriage was not genuine. If the Secretary of  State
    produces evidence justifying reasonable suspicion that the marriage  is
    not genuine, the evidential burden shifts to the applicant  to  address
    the  evidence  justifying  reasonable  suspicion.  Evidence  justifying
    reasonable suspicion that a marriage is not genuine includes a  failure
    to answer a request for documentary proof of  the  genuineness  of  the
    marriage. Even where the evidential burden shifts to the applicant, the
    ultimate legal burden rests on the Secretary of State to establish that
    the marriage is  a  marriage  of  convenience.  In  this  respect,  the
    question for me as the judge is whether: "in the light of the  totality
    of the evidence before me, including the assessment of the  applicant's
    answers and any information provided, I  am satisfied that it  is  more
    probable  than  not  that  this  is  a  marriage  of  convenience":  IS
    (marriages of convenience) Serbia  [2008]  UKAIT  31,  Papajorgji  (EEA
    spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC),  Agho
    v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 1198 and Rosa v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 14.

12. Accordingly, the first question is whether the respondent  has  adduced
    evidence to justify a reasonable suspicion that  the  marriage  between
    the appellant and sponsor is a marriage of convenience.

13. In her decision  letter,  the  respondent  gave  her  reasons  for  her
    conclusion that the marriage was  not  a  genuine  one,  which  may  be
    summarised as follows:

    i)      Where a request for additional information had been made  under
        regulation 20B(2)(a), regulation  20B(4)  of  the  EEA  Regulations
        provides:

                 "(4)  If, without good reason, A or B fail to provide  the
                 additional information requested  or,  fail  to  attend  an
                 interview on at least two  occasions  if  so  invited,  the
                 Secretary of State may draw any  factual  inferences  about
                 A's entitlement to a right to reside as appear  appropriate
                 in the circumstances."

    ii)     The respondent did not accept the explanation for  the  failure
        to attend the first  interview.  She  considered  that,  given  the
        importance of the interview, the appellant  could  be  expected  to
        have made every effort to ensure that he did not miss his train  or
        to get another train.

    iii)    The respondent also rejected the explanation for the failure to
        attend the second interview. She considered  that  the  appellant's
        condition was not such that he was prohibited  from  attending  the
        interview and, further, that, if his condition was  linked  to  his
        immigration status, he would have attended the interview  in  order
        to establish that his marriage was a genuine one.

    iv)      The  respondent  therefore  considered   that,   pursuant   to
        regulation 20B(4) of the EEA Regulations, she was entitled to  draw
        factual inferences as may appropriate from the appellant's  failure
        to attend the two interviews without good reason.

    v)      The respondent considered  that  the  appellant  had  submitted
        insufficient evidence to demonstrate  that  he  was  in  a  genuine
        relationship with an EEA national and had failed to comply  with  a
        request  to  attend  at  interview.  In  these  circumstances,  the
        respondent deemed it appropriate to draw  the  inference  that  the
        appellant was not in a genuine relationship with an EEA national.

14. I have noted that, in relation to the appellant's explanation  for  his
    failure to attend the first interview on 16 February 2016, there is  an
    email from  the  email  address:  [~]@chancerycssolicitors.com  to  the
    "Migration Interview Team" sent on 15  February  2016  timed  at  13:26
    which states:

            "Dear Sirs madam [sic],

            we eriet [sic] to inform you that our  client  is  not  able  to
        attend todays [sic] marriage interview  because  they  have  missed
        their train. We have enclosed herewith copies of the  train  ticket
        for your attention. we also to state that  our  client  has  an  on
        going medical condition which we shall forward to you as soon as we
        receive same".

15. This email is preceded by an email sent to [~]@chancerycssolicitors.com
    from [~]@yahoo.com on 15 February 2016 timed at 12:39. Presumably, this
    email contained the scanned tickets. Copies of  the  tickets  are  also
    before me. They  were  valid  for  travel  on  16  February  2016  from
    Peterborough to Liverpool stations on East Midlands  Trains,  departing
    Peterborough at 07:27.

16. Accordingly, it is clear that the email from the appellant's solicitors
    to the respondent's Migration Interview  Team,  which  said   that  the
    appellant and his spouse had missed  their  train,  was  sent  one  day
    before the interview was due to take  place  and  one  day  before  the
    appellant and his spouse were due to travel. At the time when  the  two
    emails referred to at paras 14 and 15 were sent, the appellant and  his
    sponsor could not have already missed their train for the simple reason
    that the email was sent one day before. On the standard of the  balance
    of probabilities, I reject the explanation for the  failure  to  attend
    the first interview as a total fabrication.

17. The explanation for the failure to attend the  second  interview  on  3
    March 2016 is that  the  appellant  was  unwell.  In  support  of  this
    explanation, the appellant relies upon the psychiatric  report  of  Dr.
    Balasubramaniam. I have noted that Dr. Balasubramaniam  said  that  the
    appellant was unfit to attend the  interview  at  that  time.  However,
    given  that  Dr.  Balasubramaniam  said  that,  in  his  opinion,   the
    appellant's condition was due, in part, to his  immigration  status,  I
    have taken into account the complete absence of any evidence  that  the
    appellant has done anything since being examined by Dr. Balasubramaniam
    to put himself in the position of being able  to  attend  an  interview
    about his marriage. For example, there is no evidence that he has  seen
    his GP about his symptoms and commenced treatment.  This  is  important
    given that Dr. Balasubramaniam considered that the appellant would feel
    better 3 weeks after commencing anti-depressant treatment. There is  no
    medical evidence to  update  the  position  since  Dr.  Balasubramaniam
    examined the appellant. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the
    respondent was entitled to reject  as  unsatisfactory  the  explanation
    offered by the appellant for failing to attend the second interview.

18.  The  documentary  evidence  submitted  by  the  appellant   with   his
    application for a residence card is mentioned in the letters  from  his
    solicitors dated 4 August 2015, 5 November 2015  and  19  January  2016
    (pages F1-4 of the respondent's bundle). The evidence may be summarised
    as follows:


    i)      The application form.
      ii)   Nigerian passport [this is mentioned twice at page F2].
    iii)    Marriage certificate.
    iv)     Wedding photographs.
    v)      Letter of appointment [it is unclear what this relates to].
      vi)   Wage slip.
    vii)    BUPA insurance.
    viii)   3 passport sized photographs.
    ix)     Portuguese ID.
    x)      (page F3) the sponsor's contract of employment and current wage
    slip.
    xi)     (page F4) another wage slip for the sponsor.

19. The Nigerian passport and  Portuguese  identity  document  concern  the
    identities of the appellant and the sponsor. However, there is no issue
    about their identities.  Assuming  that  the  "letter  of  appointment"
    relates to employment, it together with the wage slips and contract  of
    employment for the sponsor do not go towards  the  genuineness  of  the
    marriage. In relation to the wedding photographs, there is no issue  as
    to whether the marriage has in fact taken  place.  The  BUPA  insurance
    policy is in joint names but such an insurance policy can be  cancelled
    at any time. The existence of  such  a  policy  does  not,  of  itself,
    demonstrate that there was a genuine relationship between the appellant
    and the sponsor.

20. I have noted that no witness statements  from  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor were submitted with the application.

21. On the whole of the evidence, bearing in mind in particular what I have
    said in relation to the appellant's explanations  for  the  failure  to
    attend the two interviews, I have concluded  that  the  respondent  has
    adduced reasonable grounds for suspecting that the marriage between the
    appellant and the sponsor was a marriage of convenience.

22. In my judgment and for the reasons given above, the  evidential  burden
    has shifted  to  the  appellant  to  address  the  evidence  justifying
    reasonable suspicion.

23. The appellant has submitted documents which include bank statements  in
    joint names, gas and electricity bills in joint  names  issued  by  SSE
    Southern Electricity, the BUPA insurance policy  in  joint  names,  his
    witness statement dated 3 June  2016,  a  witness  statement  from  the
    sponsor dated 3 June 2016, some  wedding  photographs  and  some  other
    photographs.

24. I shall deal first  with  the  statements  from  Lloyds  Bank,  account
    number: 54526862, sort-code 77-72-16, in the names of the appellant and
    the sponsor. The statements are for the period from 2 November 2015  to
    25 May 2016. I can see that these statements show  that  the  sponsor's
    salary from Godways Cleaning was paid into the account on the following
    dates:

                 3 Dec 2015: �600.00
                 11 Jan 2016:     �600.00
                 11 Feb 2016:     �600.00
                 7 Mar 2016: �600.00
                 4 May 2016: �600.00

25. These payments  tie  in  (approximately)  with  the  payslips  dated  2
    November 2015, 2 December 2015, 2 January 2016, 2 February 2016  and  2
    March 2016 from Godways Cleaning showing that her  net  pay  for  these
    months was �600.00.

26. I have analysed the transactions shown  the  bank  statements.  I  have
    identified 62 groups of transactions as set out below. In each of these
    62 groups of transactions, the total amounts of money credited  is  the
    same as, or similar the same as, the total amount of  money  withdrawn.
    Whilst I note that these 62  groups  of  transactions  include  entries
    showing deposits and withdrawals referencing  the  appellant's  or  the
    sponsor's names, they also include entries showing deposits from  other
    sources and debit payments to a variety of third parties. I consider it
    utterly lacking in credibility that, by sheer  coincidence  and  in  no
    fewer than 62 groups of transactions, the total amounts of the deposits
    match exactly, or  nearly  the  same  as,  the  total  amounts  of  the
    withdrawals  notwithstanding  that  on  many  occasions  they   include
    payments  to  and  from  third  parties.  It  is  utterly  lacking   in
    credibility, if these deposits and withdrawals are evidence of  genuine
    transactions, money that has been credited is subsequently withdrawn in
    one or more withdrawals either on the same day or  within  days  on  no
    fewer than 62 occasions.

27. The 62 groups of transactions are:

28. Of course, I bear in mind that these may be  genuine  transactions  and
    that the deposits were made in order to cover anticipated outgoings.  I
    also take into account the fact that  the  remaining  transactions  are
    insignificant in number and amount, a fact which does not suggest  that
    this account is being operated bona fides.

29. Although the bank account is in  joint  names,  there  is  no  evidence
    before me to show that the appellant and  the  sponsor  have  an  equal
    right to operate this account or that there is an  overdraft  facility.
    If, for example, there is no overdraft  facility  or  it  is  only  the
    sponsor who is mandated to operate this account,  she  does  not  place
    herself at risk of the appellant withdrawing money or  going  overdrawn
    without her authority. I take into account the lack of such evidence.

30. I do not consider that  the  photographs  of  the  wedding  assist  the
    appellant given that it  is  accepted  that  he  and  the  sponsor  are
    married. The other photographs are very small in number and  simply  do
    not show that this couple have any meaningful social life as a  couple.
    The sponsor's witness statement is brief  and  provides  little  or  no
    information about their life together  as  a  couple.  The  appellant's
    witness statement states, for example,  that  they  visit  friends  and
    family members together, they go to the cinema and clubs together, they
    have many things in common and intend  to  "start  making  children  in
    2017" but there is a complete lack of depth of information about  their
    lives together as husband and wife. If this couple are genuinely  in  a
    relationship as husband and wife, it is surprising  indeed  that  there
    are no witness statement from  their  friends  and  family  members  to
    attest that they entered into a genuine marriage.

31. The gas and electricity bills in joint names  issued  by  SSE  Southern
    Electricity and the evidence of the  BUPA  insurance  policy  in  joint
    names do not of themselves provide evidence  that  this  is  a  genuine
    relationship.

32. I have considered all of the evidence in the round. On the whole of the
    evidence, I have  concluded  that  the  evidence  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant  goes  nowhere  near  addressing  the   evidence   justifying
    reasonable suspicion that the marriage is a marriage of convenience. To
    the contrary, the evidence he has  adduced,  in  particular,  the  bank
    statements, itself raises significant concerns, as I have explained. As
    a result of  his  failure  to  attend  the  hearing,  these  additional
    concerns are not addressed.

33. I therefore turn to consider whether the respondent has discharged  the
    ultimate legal burden upon her to show that the  marriage  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor is a marriage of convenience.

34. I am satisfied, for the reasons given at para 14 onwards, that, on  the
    whole                 of                 the                  evidence,
          the respondent has discharged the ultimate legal burden upon  her
    to show that it is more likely than not that the marriage is a marriage
    of convenience. Indeed, it is beyond reasonable doubt that  this  is  a
    marriage  of  convenience,  although  I  appreciate  that  this  higher
    criminal standard of proof is not applicable. I make it  clear  that  I
    would have reached this finding even if I had not had  the  concerns  I
    have described regarding the bank account. I find that a  couple  in  a
    genuine relationship would not have needed to concoct  the  explanation
    this couple concocted as to why they were unable to  attend  the  first
    interview.

35. My conclusion, that this is a marriage of convenience, is supported  by
    the fact that the appellant has now had two opportunities to attend  an
    interview with the respondent and two opportunities to attend a hearing
    before the Tribunal, the first being the hearing before  Judge  Robison
    and the second being the hearing before me. He has  not  taken  any  of
    these four opportunities. Whilst the failure to take up  one,  or  even
    two, of these opportunities is not fatal, the  fact  that  he  has  not
    taken up four opportunities in total is beyond a mere coincidence. I am
    satisfied that this is a man who does not wish to present  himself  for
    questioning because he knows that he entered into a sham marriage.

36.  The  appellant's  appeal  is  therefore  dismissed   under   the   EEA
    Regulations.

37. Para 2 of the grounds of appeal contends that the decision is  unlawful
    because it is incompatible with the appellant's rights under  the  1950
    European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and  Fundamental
    Freedoms (ECHR). However, since this is an appeal  against  a  decision
    under the EEA Regulations and the respondent did not serve  a  one-stop
    notice under s.120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,
    the appellant cannot rely upon any  human  rights  ground  (Amirteymour
    [2015] UKUT 00466 (IAC) and TY (Sri  Lanka)  v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    1233).


      Decision


    The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law such  that  it  falls  to  be  set
    aside. The Upper Tribunal has set aside the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal and proceeded to re-make  the  decision  on  the  appeal.  The
    decision is  that  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision of 25 March 2016 is  dismissed  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.
