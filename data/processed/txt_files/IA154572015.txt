                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals  against  the  decision  of  Judge  T  R
    Cockrill of the First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 27th  June
    2016.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FTT and I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a female citizen of China born 19th June 1979.  On 13th
    March 2015 the Appellant applied for leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on the basis that she had resided in this country  since  2000,
    married her husband, also a Chinese citizen, in this country  in  2006,
    and they had a child born here on 13th December 2008.

 4. The application was refused on 14th April 2015.  The Secretary of State
    did not accept that the Appellant could satisfy the  Immigration  Rules
    in Appendix FM in relation  to  family  life,  nor  could  she  satisfy
    paragraph 276ADE(1) in relation to her private life.

 5. The Secretary of State did not accept that there were  any  exceptional
    circumstances which would warrant granting leave to remain outside  the
    Immigration  Rules,  pursuant  to  Article  8  of  the  1950   European
    Convention on Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 6. The Claimant's appeal was heard by the FTT on 17th June 2016.   By  the
    time of the appeal hearing the Claimant and her husband  had  a  second
    child, born on 16th February 2016.

 7. The FTT heard  evidence  from  the  Appellant,  her  husband,  and  the
    godparents of the Appellant's eldest child, who  by  the  time  of  the
    hearing had lived in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous  period  in
    excess of seven years.

 8. The FTT found that the Appellant would not succeed  in  her  appeal  by
    reliance upon the Immigration  Rules,  but  allowed  the  appeal  under
    Article  8,  with  specific  reference  to  section  117B(6)   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act).   The  FTT
    found that the Appellant's eldest child is a qualifying child by reason
    of residence in the United Kingdom for a continuous period in excess of
    seven years, and found that the Appellant has a genuine and  subsisting
    parental relationship  with  her  child,  and  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.

 9. The decision of the FTT prompted the Secretary of State  to  apply  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.   The  Secretary  of  State
    relied upon MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705, submitting that the test
    of reasonableness is a wide  one,  and  should  not  be  restricted  to
    consideration of the child's best interests.  I set out below paragraph
    3 of the grounds seeking permission to appeal;

         "3.  It would appear that in  this  case  the  appeal  was  allowed
             because the eldest son had been in the UK for over seven years
             and he refuses to learn Mandarin.  It is submitted  that  this
             assessment is insufficient for a point  of  such  gravity  and
             that the assessment by the Tribunal is unsustainable."

10. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge P J M Hollingworth of the FTT
    in the following terms;

         "1.  It is arguable that the judge  has  set  out  an  insufficient
             analysis of the wider proportionality factors relating to  the
             question of reasonableness in reaching his  conclusions.   The
             judge has referred  to  the  test  being  one  in  essence  of
             reasonableness and looking at the  overall  circumstances  and
             particularly focusing on the interests of the elder child.

         2.   It is arguable that an insufficient analysis has been set  out
             of the overall circumstances and of the  relationship  between
             the requirements of the Immigration Rules and the issue of the
             public interest in the overall context of proportionality."

11. Following the  grant  of  permission,  directions  were  issued  making
    provision for there to be a hearing before the Upper Tribunal to decide
    whether the FTT decision contained an error of law such that it  should
    be set aside.



Submissions

12. Mr Bramble relied upon the grounds contained within the application for
    permission to  appeal,  and  submitted  that  seven  years'  continuous
    residence would carry more weight from the age of 4, rather than  seven
    years from the date of birth.  Mr Bramble submitted that  the  FTT  had
    erred by over-emphasising the interests of the child.  The FTT had also
    erred by making findings not supported by evidence, such as  concluding
    that if removed to China, the child would "go back quite a  few  stages
    in his educational development"  and  would  have  to  be  taught  with
    children at the nursery stage, which would have a psychological  effect
    upon him.  Mr Bramble pointed to the lack of a psychologist's report.

13. Mr Bramble submitted that the FTT had not appreciated  that  the  child
    was at a very early stage of his  education,  and  had  not  adequately
    explained why the child would face significant social  difficulties  in
    trying to establish himself in Chinese society, and there was no  basis
    for the conclusion that the child would face a range of difficulties in
    China.  Also, Mr Bramble submitted that the judge had not explained the
    finding at paragraph 103, that the child is "at an important  stage  in
    his life," noting that at the date of the FTT hearing,  the  child  was
    only 7 years of age.

14. Mr Kerr relied upon his skeleton argument dated 6th January  2017.   He
    submitted that Mr Bramble's oral submissions went  beyond  the  grounds
    seeking permission to appeal.  Mr  Kerr  submitted  that  the  FTT  had
    considered all relevant evidence in relation to  the  child,  including
    education, and the fact that he is being brought  up  as  a  Protestant
    Christian.

15. Mr Kerr submitted that the  FTT  had  taken  into  account  the  public
    interest, by making a reference at paragraph  106  to  the  immigration
    history of the Appellant.  Mr  Kerr  submitted  that  the  Respondent's
    reasons for refusal letter dated 14th  April  2015  accepted  that  the
    Appellant's eldest child would face some difficulties  if  returned  to
    China.   Mr  Kerr  specifically  relied  upon  paragraph  103   of   MA
    (Pakistan), which states that children are not to  be  blamed  for  the
    fact  that  their  parents  overstayed  illegally,  and  seven   years'
    residence is a factor which must weigh heavily.



My Conclusions and Reasons

16. The FTT cannot be criticised for failing to  refer  to  MA  (Pakistan),
    which had not been published when the FTT decision was made.   However,
    MA (Pakistan), sets out the  principles  that  must  be  followed  when
    considering whether it is reasonable  to  expect  a  child  with  seven
    years' residence in the United Kingdom, to leave this  country.   If  a
    Tribunal carries out a different interpretation, that would  amount  to
    an error of law.

17. MA (Pakistan) makes  it  clear  that  when  considering  the  issue  of
    reasonableness the focus is not simply on the child  but  must  embrace
    all aspects of the public interest.  I set out below paragraph  101  of
    MA (Pakistan);

         "101.    But for reasons I have given, that is not  the  test,  the
             court can have regard to the wider public interest,  including
             the immigration history of the applicant and his parents.  The
             question, therefore, is whether  the  judge  was  entitled  to
             conclude, having regard to these considerations and all  other
             aspects  of  the  public  interest,  that  it  would  not   be
             unreasonable to require the child to return to Pakistan."

18. In this appeal, I do not find that the FTT materially erred in law  for
    the following reasons.

19. The FTT considered the  best  interests  of  the  child  as  a  primary
    consideration.  The best interests were not  regarded  as  a  paramount
    consideration.  The FTT went on to find that it was not  reasonable  to
    expect the Appellant's eldest child to leave the  United  Kingdom,  and
    this finding was open to the FTT to make, on the evidence before it.  I
    find  that  adequate  reasons  have  been  given  for   reaching   that
    conclusion.

20. I do not find, as contended in paragraph 3 of the Secretary of  State's
    grounds, that the FTT allowed the  appeal  simply  because  the  eldest
    child had been in the UK for over seven  years  and  refused  to  learn
    Mandarin.

21. It is not contended that the FTT erred in finding that the  Appellant's
    eldest child is a qualifying child as defined in section  117D  of  the
    2002 Act, neither is it contended that the FTT erred  in  finding  that
    the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with
    her child.

22. The FTT correctly found, at paragraph 95, that the "critical  issue  is
    really the  reasonableness  of  expecting  that  child  to  leave  this
    country."

23. The FTT took into account that the child was  born  in  the  UK,  spoke
    English not Mandarin, had lived in the UK for in excess of seven years,
    had been educated here, and  was  being  brought  up  as  a  Protestant
    Christian.  I do  not  find  that  the  FTT  adequately  explained  the
    conclusion at paragraph 103 that the child is at an important stage  in
    his life.  It is not the case that  the  child  is  at  a  particularly
    important stage in his education, as it is common ground that he is  at
    a very early stage, at 7 years of age, in his education.

24. I do not find that the FTT concentrated  solely  upon  the  child  when
    considering  the  issue  of  reasonableness.   The  FTT  set  out   the
    Appellant's immigration history at paragraphs 4-11.  The  FTT  recorded
    that the Appellant entered the UK on 7th November 2000, and  had  leave
    to remain until 31st July 2012.  The FTT recognised that the  Appellant
    had not had leave since 31st July 2012, noting at  paragraph  106  that
    the Appellant had leave to remain for the majority of the time that she
    had been in the UK.  The FTT found that the  Appellant  had  maintained
    contact with the Home Office, and had made attempts to  regularise  her
    immigration status.

25. The FTT records that the Appellant gave evidence  in  English,  and  it
    does not appear to have been suggested to the FTT, that  the  Appellant
    could not support herself financially,  or  could  not  communicate  in
    English.  It was not suggested to the FTT that the  Appellant  had  any
    criminal convictions.

26.  In  my  view,  the  FTT  could  have  set  out  the  public   interest
    considerations more clearly, but I do not find any error of law on this
    issue.  This is not a  case  where  the  FTT  has  ignored  the  public
    interest considerations, and concentrated solely upon the  child,  when
    deciding whether it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the  child  to
    leave the UK.

27. I set out below, in part, paragraph 49 of MA (Pakistan);

         "49. However, the fact that the child has been in the UK for  seven
             years would  need  to  be  given  significant  weight  in  the
             proportionality  exercise  for  two  related  reasons,  first,
             because  of  its  relevance  to  determining  the  nature  and
             strength of the child's best interests; and second, because it
             establishes as a starting point that leave should  be  granted
             unless there are powerful reasons to the contrary."

    I do not find that any powerful reasons were placed before the  FTT  to
    indicate that it would be reasonable to remove  the  Claimant's  eldest
    child from the UK.  While it may be said that another Tribunal may have
    reached a different conclusion, that is not the point nor the  test  to
    be applied.  The Secretary of State's grounds disclose  a  disagreement
    with the conclusion reached by the FTT, but do not disclose a  material
    error of law.  In my view, the FTT  adequately  considered  whether  it
    would be reasonable for the Appellant's eldest child to leave  the  UK,
    and did not materially err in law in doing so.




Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the FTT did  not  involve  the  making  of  an
error on a point of law such that the decision must be set aside.  I do  not
set aside the decision.  The appeal of the Secretary of State is  dismissed.




Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made by the FTT.  There has been no  request  for
anonymity made to the Upper Tribunal, and no anonymity order is made.
