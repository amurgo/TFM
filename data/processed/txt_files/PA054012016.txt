For the Appellant:     Ms A Imamovic, instructed by Braitch Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    appellant in  this  determination  identified  as  SH.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings




      1. Permission to appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Row
         dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision
         to refuse international protection was granted by UTJ Eshun on 27th
         November 2018 on the grounds:

          i) It was arguable the judge had reached findings on the basis of
             the appellant's return to Albania as an adult aged  18  rather
             than on the date of hearing;

         ii)  It  was  arguable  the  judge  had  failed  to  consider  the
             respondent's concession that there were no adequate  reception
             arrangement in place for the appellant on  return  to  Albania
             and failed to give consideration to the care order made by the
             local authority and the oral evidence  of  the  social  worker
             that his family had not been able to be contacted, and that in
             the absence of contact with his family at the date of  hearing
             he would be at risk of serious harm on return;

        iii) It was  arguable  the  judge  gave  no  consideration  to  the
             background country information concerning risks to children in
             Albania on account of age, ethnicity, culture  that  would  be
             likely to result in destitution and exploitation;

         iv) It  was  arguable  that  the  appellant's  evidence  regarding
             whether or not he lived with his father was  not  inconsistent
             such as to adversely impact upon the appellant's credibility;

          v) It was arguable that having found the appellant had  submitted
             all material  factors  at  his  disposal  and  his  claim  was
             plausible, there was a contradiction in the  finding  that  he
             could have contacted the Albanian embassy  to  obtain  further
             evidence about his passport;

         vi) It was arguable  that  the  late  disclosure  of  having  been
             attacked by  his  stepmother  with  an  axe  was  due  to  his
             vulnerability as a minor and inability to manifest  his  fears
             at the relevant time rather than a fabrication of the  claimed
             attack;

        vii) It was arguable that the judge had  failed  to  have  adequate
             regard to or consideration  of  the  evidence  of  the  social
             worker and/or the foster carer;

       viii) It was arguable that the judge had  failed  to  have  adequate
             regard to or consideration of the submission that there was no
             evidential link to the appellant of his passport being used to
             leave Albania in a car in September 2014 rather than  a  lorry
             and the respondent had failed  to  provide  adequate  evidence
             thereof.

         Background

      2. The appellant, an Albanian national date  of  birth  27th  February
         2003, arrived in the UK on 6th  November  2014  and  was  taken  to
         Social Services. He was referred to the National Referral Mechanism
         as a potential victim of trafficking who decided, on 20th  February
         2015, that he had not been trafficked to  the  UK  and  was  not  a
         victim of trafficking. He then claimed asylum and was  screened  on
         23rd  July  2015.  He  submitted,  through  solicitors,  a  witness
         statement and in March 2016 his solicitors informed the  respondent
         that he wished to rely upon his witness statement in support of his
         asylum claim.

      3. The basis of the appellant's claim was that he feared  that  if  he
         was returned to Albania he would face mistreatment from his father.

      4. The respondent accepted the appellant was who he said he  was,  was
         an Albanian national with a date of birth as  claimed.  His  asylum
         claim was however rejected for reasons set out in a decision letter
         dated 10th May 2016.

      5. The appellant appealed the decision. First-tier Tribunal judge A  J
         Parker dismissed his appeal for  reasons  set  out  in  a  decision
         promulgated on 16th June 2017. Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Renton
         found an error of law in that decision and remitted it to be  heard
         afresh by the First-tier Tribunal on 30th April  2018.  It  is  the
         First-tier Tribunal decision  of  Judge  Row,  promulgated  on  7th
         August 2018, that followed that remittal that  is  the  subject  of
         this appeal.

         Evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.

      6. The appellant relied upon a consolidated bundle of evidence of  135
         pages. Also, before the First-tier Tribunal judge was a copy  of  a
         'tracing  report',  skeleton  argument  of  Ms  Imamovic  and   the
         respondent's bundle of documents. Neither bundle included  the  NRM
         trafficking decision.

      7. In his witness statement signed 27th October  2015,  the  appellant
         said

             "...

             4.   I confirm that I lived with  my  father,  my  mother,  my
             brother (...) and my sister (...) in Albania.

             ...

             6.   I confirm that I fear  going  back  home  because  of  my
             father.

             7.   He was violent towards me,  my  mother,  my  brother  and
             sister.

             ...

             10.  My father treated me very badly.

             ...

             12.  I was playing with my friend R when we saw a  big  lorry.
             We hid in the lorry...

             ...

             23.  I do not want to go back to Albania because I  am  afraid
             of my father and what may happen to me if I go back.

             ..."

      8. In his witness statement signed 26th October  2016,  the  appellant
         said

             "3.  I would also like to add the following as I can  remember
             more about what happened to me than I could before.

             4.   Before I left Albania  I  was  playing  with  R  when  my
             father's second wife came running towards us with an axe.

             ...

             7.   One of my relatives called my mum and she came that  same
             day.

             8.   When I saw her she had a mark/scar  on  her  face  and  I
             asked her what happened. She said she was fine and she left.

             10.  I cannot remember how long  I  stayed  at  my  relative's
             house.

             11.  Then one day I was playing outside with  R  and  a  lorry
             came.

             12.  There were some men who came and wanted to take us.

             13.  Me and R also wanted to leave and  so  we  got  into  the
             lorry by ourselves and hid in the lorry.

             ...

             24.  He [father] also had a second wife who would also hit  me
             for no reason.

             ...

             30.  I would also like to state that I have held  an  Albanian
             passport. I previously said that I had  not  ever  been  issue
             with a passport because I believed I was being asked if I used
             a passport to travel.

             31.  I do not know when my passport was issued but I  remember
             holding one because my mother showed it to me when I was  very
             young, however, when my mother showed it to me I  remember  my
             father taking it from her and I never saw  my  passport  after
             this. I cannot recall how old I was when this happened.

             32.  I wish to confirm that I did not leave  Albania  with  my
             passport as it was my father who kept it. I had not planned my
             departure from Albania and simply got into the lorry and  hid.
             I did not have my passport or anyone else's passport  with  me
             and I did not leave Albania on my passport.

             33.  I believe that if there are any records of someone  using
             a passport to leave Albania that it was not me and although  I
             cannot be sure, I think my father may have sold  the  passport
             to make money."

      9. In a 'Best Interests input' prepared by his social worker  Rochelle
         Blake, dated 1st December 2015, she said, inter alia,

             'Family and social relationships

             ...states that in Albania he lives with  his  mother,  father,
             younger sister and younger brother. At  present  [  ]  has  no
             contact with his parents or any members of his birth family. [
             ] stated that he does not want to return home or have  contact
             with his parents...

             ...

             Other vulnerabilities

             [ ] is sure that he does not want to return to Albania  as  he
             is scared what may happen if reconnected with his family. [  ]
             was a victim  of  violence  from  his  birth  father  who  was
             physically abusive towards him, his mother and  his  siblings;
             ...'

     10. In a letter dated 2nd May 2017 from Rochelle  Blake  addressed  'To
         Whom it May Concern' she states, inter alia,

             '...

             During statutory visits to see [ ] in his foster placement  he
             continuously expresses he does not wish to return  to  Albania
             and maintains this. When spoken to about home life [ ] is very
             reserved and his presence becomes low as he expresses to  have
             suffered some traumatic experiences when living in Albania...

             ...

             ... [ ] fears having to return to Albania and be  at  risk  of
             harm due to fearing his father will locate him.

             ...'

     11. In a letter dated 26th October 2016, B..,  the  appellant's  foster
         carer since 7th November 2014, said, inter alia,

             "...He was very distraught, a very  frightened  child  and  it
             took us some months to settle him in. He would flinch when  we
             walked past him ...

             ... he seems reluctant to talk about them [his birth  family].
             He says he misses them and I have explained  that  if  he  did
             want to go back to his birth country it could be arranged. His
             reaction to this was quite upsetting as he was vehement in his
             statement of not going back  to  his  birth  father  and  step
             mother as they were both cruel to him.

             ...

             I do not find anything about [ ] that is untruthful. I believe
             everything he has told me.

             ...

             He was very upset  because  he  had  never  travelled  on  the
             passport. He thinks his father may have sold it to someone  in
             the club that father owns.

             ..."

     12. In a letter dated  29th  March  2017  addressed  'To  Whom  it  May
         Concern' Gail Hardy, the Independent Reviewing Officer said,  inter
         alia,

             "... I am writing in support of the above young  person  being
             afforded permanent Leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

             ...

             He does not wish to return to Albania ... It is unclear of all
             the facts in how [ ] came to reside in the  UK.  Nevertheless,
             what is certain at his young age is  he  made  a  decision  he
             could no longer reside with his biological family in  Albania.
             He appears to have suffered some traumatic experiences at  the
             hands of his family.

             ..."

     13. Also before the First-tier Tribunal was a copy of a care order made
         on 23rd January 2018. There is no record on the face of that  order
         or separately, that  the  family  court  gave  permission  for  the
         content of that order to be  disclosed  to  the  IAC.  Ms  Imamovic
         stated that she  had  requested  her  instructing  solicitors  seek
         permission for tits disclosure but she was not aware  whether  that
         had in fact been done. In any event she said that the oral evidence
         was that  the  Local  Authority  had  attempted  to  find  out  the
         whereabouts of the appellant's family through the Albanian  Embassy
         but had had no response, hence the order had been made.

     14.  The  tracing  document  provided  information  obtained  from  the
         Albanian authorities:

             '...

             The family is registered as living in an  unspecified  address
             in Shishtavec, Kukes, Albania. The current family  composition
             consists of the subject himself, his mother (single)  and  two
             siblings.'

         The document goes on to set out information on border checks  which
         indicate that the appellant left Albania on 15  September  2014  to
         Kosovo by car and has  not  returned;  and  that  his  mother  left
         Albania to Kosovo by car  on  14th  June  2013  and  there  was  no
         'registration' of her coming in.

         Scanned copies of the appellant's personal and family  certificates
         were attached together with details  of  the  appellant's  passport
         number, validity (01/09/2014 to 31/08/2019).

         Error of law

     15. In her submissions before me Ms Imamovic  very  properly  condensed
         the grounds relied upon as much of what she submitted  were  errors
         of law relied upon the same underlying matters and should be viewed
         cumulatively rather than in isolation. There was no  suggestion  by
         Ms Imamovic, and it has not been pleaded, that the judge  did  not,
         in reaching his decision, have adequate regard to  the  appellant's
         age either at the time of his screening interview, when he made his
         witness statements, when he gave oral evidence or in  reaching  his
         findings.

         Alleged inconsistencies:

     16. Ms Imamovic submitted that in �26 through to �29[1], the First-tier
         Tribunal Judge accepts the appellant's evidence  and  that  he  had
         made  a  genuine  effort  to  support  his  claim  and   this   was
         inconsistent with the judge's findings that further evidence  could
         have been obtained and that the discrepancies damage  his  account.
         It is correct that the judge confirms the appellant  has  submitted
         the evidence that he had. That  does  not  however  mean  that  the
         appellant has obtained all the evidence he could have  obtained  or
         that the judge is in some way prevented from reaching  findings  on
         the evidence, and  lack  of  evidence,  that  is  before  him.  The
         statements by the judge in �26 to �30  are  an  acceptance  by  the
         judge of the manner in which the appellant has made his  claim  and
         approached the process and that he has not sought  to  hide  or  in
         some way manipulate such evidence as there was. It may be that  his
         solicitors should have endeavoured  to  make  other  enquiries  for
         example obtaining the consent to the release of  the  family  court
         order or the evidence that was before the judge when the order  was
         made or should have  made  enquires  of  the  Albanian  authorities
         regarding the use  of  the  passport  or  the  whereabouts  of  the
         appellant's father or whether there was  a  record  of  his  father
         having married someone else. That evidence, if it exists,  was  not
         before the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  who  is  required  to  make
         findings  on  the  evidence  before  him.  That  is  what  he  did.
         Throughout his findings, the judge has scrupulously factored in the
         appellant's vulnerability as disclosed to him.

     17. The judge finds that the discrepancy in the appellant's evidence as
         to  whether  he  had  ever  held  a  passport  [2]  a   significant
         discrepancy but that he may have misunderstood the question and  it
         did not damage his credibility.

     18. The judge found the appellant's  evidence  as  regards  his  family
         living arrangements in Albania to be a significant  discrepancy[3].
         Ms  Imamovic  submitted  that  there  was  no  inconsistency:   the
         appellant was not stating that he had never lived with  his  father
         but that he had lived with his father but not at the  time  of  the
         incident when his  stepmother  attacked  him  with  the  axe.   She
         submitted that no timeline had been set out in  the  first  witness
         statement. The judge refers to the evidence the appellant has given
         in witness statements, prepared with solicitors  and  the  evidence
         given to social workers. Before the  judge  Ms  Imamovic  submitted
         that the Tracing Document lent support  to  the  appellant's  claim
         that he was not living with his father at the time he left Albania.
         With respect to Ms Imamovic, this  rather  misses  the  point.  The
         appellant has provided different information  at  different  times,
         only claiming not to be living with his father when evidence  comes
         to light that shows he was not. The judge finds this impacts on the
         credibility of his account.

     19. The judge considers the very late disclosure of the claimed  attack
         on him by his stepmother with an axe. Although Ms Imamovic  submits
         that, of course children disclose information in different ways  to
         adults. She did not submit (I note contrary to what he says in  his
         witness statement) that he had not remembered the axe incident, but
         that it was not until October 2016 that  he  felt  safe  enough  to
         recount the incident; that was not his evidence.  The  judge  notes
         that the appellant has had the assistance of solicitors throughout,
         that there is no mention of the axe incident in any of the  written
         evidence relied upon by the appellant until October 2016  and  that
         the first statement was made some 11 months after he had arrived in
         the UK. The written evidence from the foster  carer  refers  to  it
         being  several  months  before  he  settled  in  but  there  is  no
         explanation why some 11 months later he was unable to remember  the
         incident or unable to recount it.

     20. The judge considers the two differing accounts given in respect  of
         when he left Albania - when he was playing outside and saw a  lorry
         which he climbed into or the day after his stepmother attacked  him
         with the axe or some other unspecified time later.

     21. The judge considers the evidence of the  Tracing  document  (as  to
         which see also below) that the appellant left  Albania,  using  his
         own passport, in September 2014 and  the  appellant's  evidence  of
         when and how he left Albania.

     22. The judge was entitled to reach the findings he reached that  there
         were  significant  inconsistencies  in  the  appellant's  evidence.
         Nevertheless, the judge did not reach  his  conclusions  solely  on
         those inconsistencies. He took  them  into  account  in  his  final
         assessment.

         The tracing document

     23. Ms Imamovic submitted that there had been a lack of  disclosure  by
         the  respondent  of  the  appellant's  biometrics.  I   found   her
         submissions  difficult  to  understand.  The  respondent  had  made
         enquiries  with  the  Albanian   authorities   who   had   provided
         information about the appellant, his  family  composition  and  his
         passport. I did not understand what she meant by  'biometrics'.  It
         seems that the appellant's evidence was  that  although  it  seemed
         that the information on the passport related to  him,  he  did  not
         recall ever having had a passport issued in 2014  and  he  had  not
         travelled out of Albania on a passport  in  a  car.  There  was  no
         evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that an  enquiry  had  been
         made of the respondent or the Albanian authorities as  to  how  the
         information as to exit had been  obtained  or  how  and  when  that
         particular passport had been obtained. If the appellant  sought  to
         challenge the evidence on the tracing document which, on  its  face
         was credible and relevant, then more has to  be  done  that  simply
         assert that the 'biometrics' had not been disclosed.

     24. The judge was fully entitled to consider the content of the tracing
         document in the context of the appellant's  evidence  and  identify
         this as a discrepancy in the appellant's  evidence.  He  was  fully
         entitled to express the opinion that a challenge  to  the  document
         had to be more than  a  submission.  As  Mr  Mills  submitted,  the
         respondent had satisfied the burden of proof that the documents was
         such that it could be relied upon absent some other  evidence;  the
         appellant had not sought evidence to  rebut  the  validity  of  the
         information on the face of the document; the judge was entitled  to
         rely upon it.

         Evidence of the foster carer and social worker

     25. Ms Imamovic submitted that the judge had failed to take account  of
         their evidence that he was a fragile and disturbed  child  who  had
         clearly suffered trauma and that this supported the submission that
         it took time before he felt safe enough to disclose his account. As
         Mr Mills submitted, there was little the judge could say other than
         record what they  said.  Their  evidence  did  not  deal  with  the
         discrepancies; they said they believed his account - although it is
         not said which account it is they believe - that he was upset  when
         elements of his account were not believed but  their  evidence  was
         not such as rendered the discrepancies in the  appellant's  account
         of no or insignificant relevance.

     26. The judge fully appreciated the vulnerability of the appellant  and
         gave considerable leeway to elements of the account that  were  not
         otherwise explainable. But the evidence of  the  foster  carer  and
         social worker did not and could not  enable  the  judge  to  ignore
         those discrepancies.

         Did the judge reach a decision on the basis that he would return to
         Albania when aged 18 rather than take a decision on risk as of  the
         date of hearing?

     27.  This  ground  of  appeal  is  misconceived.  The   judge   plainly
         considered, in  �45[4],   the  circumstances  as  of  the  date  of
         hearing. Although the judge has inserted the word "Even" it  cannot
         be successfully submitted that the judge did not consider  risk  as
         of the date of hearing. The conclusions as a  whole  drawn  by  the
         judge were that the appellant was in contact with his  family,  had
         not been abused as claimed and would be able to  reunite  with  his
         family in Albania.

         Did the judge fail to take account of the views of the family court
         and the respondent that he had no family member?

     28. The first point to make is that there  was  no  evidence  available
         that the family court  had  granted  leave  for  the  order  to  be
         disclosed. The evidence of the  social  worker  that  the  Albanian
         Embassy had been contacted  and  there  had  been  no  response  is
         insufficient to enable a conclusion to be drawn that the  appellant
         did not and does not have family in Albania. That the family  court
         made a care order is an order relevant to the appellant's status in
         the UK, not whether he would or could be adequately  cared  for  in
         Albania.

     29. There does not  appear  to  have  been  any  attempt  made  by  the
         appellant's solicitors to establish from the  solicitors  who  were
         acting for him in the care proceedings, what attempts were made  to
         contact his family in Albania if any and if not why not. It is  not
         apparent what evidence was provided to the family court  which  led
         to the making of the care order. At most the  judge  was  aware  an
         order had been made and the Albanian Embassy had failed to  respond
         to an enquiry made.

     30. The respondent granted the appellant DL as an unaccompanied  asylum
         seeking minor for whom satisfactory reception arrangement could not
         be made. That is not  a  concession  by  the  respondent  that  the
         appellant cannot be returned to Albania but that at that  time  and
         on the evidence  before  him,  that  was  the  view  taken  by  the
         respondent.

     31. It is misconceived to submit that such a decision by the respondent
         is a concession that the appellant has no family in Albania or that
         his family are unable to care for him. The respondent cannot  force
         the appellant to disclose the true whereabouts of his  parents  and
         the respondent cannot simply deposit a child at a  distant  airport
         without making adequate arrangements for his reception. But that is
         not the issue here. The judge is required to make a finding on  the
         evidence  before  him  whether  the  appellant  is   in   need   of
         international protection. The judge in  this  case  considered  the
         evidence as a whole, gave detailed and sustainable reasons  why  he
         did not accept, to the lower standard of proof  taking  account  of
         the vulnerability of the appellant and giving  considerable  leeway
         and benefit of the doubt to the appellant, that the  appellant  had
         been abused by his father and/or stepmother.

     32. It follows that the judge was entitled to find that  the  appellant
         had a family he could return to in Albania without being at risk of
         serious harm. That the appellant chooses not to have  contact  with
         his family cannot result in a finding that the appellant is at risk
         of serious harm if removed. Of  course,  in  practical  terms,  the
         appellant will not be  removed  because  he  has  been  granted  DL
         because the respondent has  not  been  able  to  make  satisfactory
         arrangements. But that does not mean he is in need of international
         protection - see ZH [2009] EWCA Civ 470

         Was it arguable the judge gave no consideration to  the  background
         country information concerning risks  to  children  in  Albania  on
         account of age, ethnicity, culture that would be likely  to  result
         in the appellant suffering destitution and exploitation?

     33. Very properly, this was not pursued by Ms Imamovic before  me.  The
         appellant had been found not to be a victim of trafficking and  the
         background material relied upon in  the  bundle  was  generic.  The
         findings of the judge regarding the appellant's family were such as
         to render otiose concerns of lack of safety on return in  terms  of
         international protection. Although Ms Imamovic referred to the risk
         of  travel  between  arrival  and  his  home  it  is  difficult  to
         understand how that can result in a  finding  of  risk  of  serious
         harm: the appellant would be  returning  to  family  who  could  be
         expected to enable his safe passage.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set  aside  the  decision.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal stands.

    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made /did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule
    45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).



     Date 19th July 2019

Upper Tribunal Judge Coker
-----------------------
[1]  "26.     I am satisfied that the appellant has made a genuine effort
    to substantiate his claim. He claimed asylum. He gave an account to his
    solicitors. He cooperated in the screening interview ... he has
    cooperated in the appeal.
 27. I am satisfied that so far as is relevant all material factors at his
    disposal have been submitted.
 28. I am satisfied that the appellant's account is plausible ...
 29. I am satisfied that the appellant has made an asylum claim at the
    earliest possible time.
 30. There are matters about the appellant's claim which however are not
    coherent and which do run counter to available specific and general
    information relevant to his case. There are matters which affect his
    general credibility.
 ..."
[2]  In his screening interview he said he had not, but in his October 2016
 interview, made after disclosure of the tracing record, he said he had but
 was very young at the time

[3]  �33:     "The appellant has given significantly different accounts of
 his family arrangements. On October 2015 he had prepared a statement with
 the help of solicitors ... At paragraph 4 he said that he lived with his
 father, mother, brother, and sister. By the time of the refusal letter
 evidence had come to the attention of the respondent from the Albanian
 authorities that the appellant did not live with his father. The
 appellant's response to that, in his statement dated 26th October 2016
 prepared for the appeal, and repeated in evidence today, is that he did
 not live with his father. His father lived elsewhere but used to come
 around to his house and mistreat him.
[4]  �45  ... Even if he were to return today I do not find that he would
 be left alone with no-one to support him ...
