Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr B Malik, Counsel, instructed by Direct Access
For the respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against a decision of Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Courtney ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 19 July 2019 by
    which the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to
    refuse to grant her entry clearance as an adult dependent relative of a
    person present and settled in this country was dismissed, as was the
    appellant's article 8 appeal.

 2. In granting permission to appeal Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam
    observed that the grounds of appeal were wholly unparticularised and
    ran to over eight pages. The appellant's representatives were requested
    to re-draft the grounds of appeal to assist both the Tribunal and the
    respondent.

 3. The appellant changed representatives prior to the error of law hearing
    and re-drafted grounds of appeal were received by the Tribunal from
    Demstone Chambers on 9 March 2020.

 4. At the hearing Mr Malik represented the appellant by direct access.

Anonymity

 5. The Judge issued an anonymity direction and provided her reasons for
    doing so at [52] of her decision. Neither representative requested that
    the Tribunal set aside the direction and so it is confirmed at the
    conclusion of this decision.

Background

 6. The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines who is presently aged 25.
    Her mother, TK, is a British citizen of Filipino heritage.

 7. It is stated that three days prior to the appellant's birth her twin
    sister died. This required the appellant to be delivered under
    emergency medical care. She suffered brain damage during birth
    consequent to her brain being starved of oxygen. Such brain damage has
    led to developmental problems. She did not commence walking or talking
    until the age of 4 and her progress has not been consistent with her
    peer group. She was diagnosed at the age of 6 as having learning
    disability accompanied by behavioural disorder. TK states that the
    appellant was enrolled at different schools over time because there
    were problems in securing adequate educational facilities. For a period
    of time she was enrolled at a school for children with Down's syndrome.



 8. TK left the Philippines in September 2010 to join her husband in the
    United Kingdom. The appellant continued to reside with two older half-
    sisters and her younger brother, KK. The two sisters subsequently
    relocated, one to Manila and the other to Canada. KK was granted
    settlement in the United Kingdom though there is evidence before the
    Tribunal that he was residing with the appellant in 2019.

 9. In 2012, when aged 17, the appellant applied for entry clearance as the
    dependent child of her mother. The application was refused by the Entry
    Clearance Officer on 26 June 2012 and her appeal against that decision
    was unsuccessful (OA/13991/2012).

10. The appellant subsequently applied for a visit visa, but this was
    refused by an Entry Clearance Officer on 20 April 2017.

11. On 21 February 2018 the appellant lodged her application for entry
    clearance as an adult dependent relative. An Entry Clearance Officer
    refused the application by a decision dated 25 May 2018. It was
    acknowledged that TK had provided evidence of money remittances to the
    appellant, however it was decided that the appellant had failed to
    provide sufficient evidence to show that she met the requirements for
    adult dependents. The application was refused by reference to
    paragraphs EC-DR.1.1.(d) of Appendix FM and paragraphs E-EC-DR.2.1. to
    2.5.

12. Upon review an Entry Clearance Manager decided by way of a decision
    dated 17 January 2019 that the appellant had not met the requirements
    set out in paragraphs EC-DR.2.4. and 2.5. It was further noted that the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was consistent with the Court
    of Appeal decision in Ribeli v Entry Clearance Officer [2018] EWCA Civ
    611. The Manager concluded:

         'I note that the appellant has not provided sufficient evidence to
         suggest that she suffers from any long-term illness. In my view it
         has not been shown that as a result of age, illness or disability,
         she requires long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks and
         she does not meet the requirement set out in paragraph E-EC-DR.2.4.
         Further, on the evidence before me, it has not been shown that the
         appellant is unable, even with the practical and financial help of
         the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care in the country
         where they are living, because: (a) it is not available and there
         is no person in that country who can reasonably provide it; or (b)
         it is not affordable. She does not meet the requirement of
         paragraph E-EC-DR.2.5. of Appendix FM.'

13. The appellant appealed against this decision, relying upon the Human
    Rights Act 1998. By way of the grounds of appeal the appellant asserted
    that the Entry Clearance Officer had wrongly determined her application
    on article 8 grounds because she is a vulnerable adult who has learning
    difficulties and has been diagnosed with behavioural and cognitive
    issues. The grounds state that the appellant is unable to take care of
    herself and had been cared for by her brother who has now secured
    settlement in the United Kingdom leaving her alone without provision
    for day-to-day care. Her precarious position was further adversely
    affected by her having been subjected to a sexual assault arising from
    her vulnerability.

Hearing before the FtT

14. The appeal came before the Judge at Hatton Cross on 28 June 2019. The
    appellant's mother and stepfather attended the hearing. The Judge noted
    relevant medical evidence relied upon by the appellant:

         '17. In a letter dated 23 October 2017 [AB page 40] Danilo V
             Valencia MD states (sic): 'This is to certify that [the
             appellant], 23 years old, has an intellectual disabilities and
             emotional behavioural disorder which is moderate to severe
             that needs appropriate recognition and support. She also has
             difficulties in everyday activities like household tasks,
             socializing and managing money matters. The Philippines [has]
             got no adequate facilities to help her with these
             disabilities. As their family Physician, I am well aware of
             [the appellant's] condition. Being away from her mother she
             felt more and more frustrated and depressed which aggravates
             her condition.'

         18.  In a letter dated 6 May 2019 [AB page 53] Dr Valencia says
             that he is [the appellant's] family doctor; 'she was my
             patient since she was small, and I am fully aware of her
             disabilities.' He states that she has learning disabilities;
             'These conditions affect her overall functioning with everyday
             tasks. They pose significant limitations in her daily life and
             in her intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour thus
             she finds it difficult to learn many life skills'. Dr Valencia
             states that 'My observation and opinion are based on my
             personal assessment of [the appellant]'. Dr Valencia talks at
             length of the problems [the appellant] experiences, including
             difficulties with maths, poor time keeping, slow reading rate,
             poor comprehension, inability to cook, lacking any sense of
             danger and an inability to wash her own clothes. He states
             that [the appellant] 'needs 24-hour care'. In my judgment
             these manifestations of intellectual impairment have been
             reported to him rather than witnessed, since they are matters
             of schooling and domestic tasks.

         19.  I noted that Dr Valencia's letterhead states 'Internal
             Medicine - Gastroenterology'. Asked how he was able to say
             that [the appellant] has 'intellectual disabilities and
             emotional behavioural disorder' [TK] said that he [...] knew
             [the appellant] well. It was only when she was specifically
             asked whether he was the family doctor that she replied in the
             affirmative. There is nothing to suggest that Dr Valencia has
             any expertise in the field of emotional and behavioural
             disorder or learning disability.

         20.  Ms Dogra submitted that Dr Valencia's allusion in his first
             letter to 'difficulties in everyday activities' did not
             necessarily mean that [the appellant] required long-term
             personal care to perform those tasks. Similarly, in his second
             letter he wrote that her learning disabilities 'affect her
             overall functioning with everyday tasks' but he did not say
             that she could not perform the tasks without help. I find
             merit in these submissions.

         21.  In a Medical Certificate dated 12 October 2017 [AB page 41]
             the Psychiatrist Valerie Heena D Andora-Quilaton MD, DPBP,
             FPPA states that [the appellant] had been brought for
             assessment on 3 October 2017: 'Review of history revealed that
             [the appellant] has development delays since birth. She
             learned to walk at 4 years old. She talked when she was five.
             She also had academic difficulties. Her teachers at [her
             school] helped her pass. However, at grade 2, she was unable
             to meet even the basic requirements and hence was advised to
             seek special education. She was enrolled at Special Education
             class. She was unable to maintain her focus and concentration.
             She later refused to go to school. Since then, she had
             difficulty in interpersonal relationships. She trusted easily
             and was subjected to inappropriate sexual advances from
             neighbours. She had required 24-hour supervision since
             reaching adulthood. She was unable to work even at a minimal
             level'. In cross-examination the Sponsor said that [KK] had
             accompanied his sister to the consultation and acknowledged
             that he had told Dr Andora-Quilaton that [the appellant]
             needed 24-hour supervision. In my judgment all the information
             in the Medical Certificate quoted above can be sourced to
             [KK].

         22.  The Psychiatrist noted that [the appellant] presented with
             'euthymic mood, appropriate effect' and was dressed
             appropriately for her age and social status. Her '[t]hought
             process is goal oriented' and '[i]mpulse control is good'.
             However, her '[c]ognitive status including attention and
             concentration are below that expected of her age. Insight to
             illness and judgment are poor'. It appears that this
             assessment is based on an IQ test administered by a colleague
             (namely Cora Berjes, Psychologist) which is said to have shown
             'Moderate intellectual deficits'. The methods and detailed
             results of the IQ test have not been provided. 'Maturation and
             Development' are stated to be 'Moderate' (which strikes me as
             an odd term to use), with reference being made to [the
             appellant's] school history which was clearly not within the
             personal knowledge of Ms Andora-Quilaton. 'Training and
             Education' is classified as 'Moderate - Severe', whatever that
             might mean in practice. The Appellant's 'Social and Vocational
             Adequacy' is stated to be 'Severe' (a classification which is
             equally inexplicable), with the Psychiatrist commenting that
             'Client contributes partially to self-maintenance under
             complete 24-hour supervisions. Self-protection skills are
             minimal useful level'. All this seems to be based on what the
             Psychiatrist was told by [KK], not something that Ms Andora-
             Quilaton observed for herself.

         23.  In a report dated 20 January 2014 [see AB page 44] Celina P.
             Cordero-Gellada MD, a Fellow of the Philippine Society for
             Development and Behavioural Paediatrics, assessed 19 year-old
             [appellant] as having gross motor skills equivalent to age 10-
             12, fine motor skills equivalent to age 8, receptive and
             expressive language skills equivalent to age 6, social skills
             equivalent to age 10 and 'performance' (whatever that might
             encompass) equivalent to age 5�. Her conclusion was that the
             Appellant had 'Intellectual Disability, unclassified'".

15. As to the evidence of Dr Cordero-Gellada the Judge observed:

         '24. Despite what is said by Ms Cordero-Gellada  it  has  not  been
             suggested by the Sponsor that her daughter  has  any  problems
             vis-a-vis movements of the large muscles of the arms, legs and
             torso  (gross  motor  skills).  Equally,  there  has  been  no
             indication that she has issues  with  manual  dexterity  (fine
             motor skills). In cross-examination the Sponsor said that  her
             daughter was able to dress herself 'but  sometimes  she's  not
             aware if her clothes  are  appropriate  or  not'.  I  note  in
             passing that photographs of  the  Appellant  included  in  the
             appeal bundle show a poised and stylish young woman. [TK] said
             that [the appellant] could wash herself and brush  her  teeth,
             but she needed prompting  otherwise  she  would  stay  in  the
             shower for hours. She had no problems with mobility but needed
             to be accompanied by her Yaya when she went out. She was  able
             to take tablets, although she needed to be reminded to do  so.
             The Sponsor asserted that the Appellant was unable to cook  or
             wash her clothes.'

16. The Judge observes a lack of primary evidence as the appellant having
    suffered brain damage at birth:

         '26. The evidence as to the Appellant's schooling is internally
             inconsistent since Ms Cordero-Gellada records [the
             appellant's] 'Educational attainment' as Grade III whereas Ms
             Andora-Quilaton says that she was 'unable to progress beyond
             first grade level'.'

17. In her evidence before the Judge, TK detailed her belief that the
    appellant had no sense of personal danger:

         "27. The Sponsor said that [the appellant] had 'no sense of
             danger', which made her vulnerable. This had led to her being
             molested by a neighbour in 2016, and on another occasion she
             had burnt her hand. A medical certificate from St Therese MTCC
             Hospital dated 2 December 2015 [see AB page 45] states that
             the Appellant suffered electrical burns to her fingers and was
             hospitalised between 22 and 25 November 2015. Various
             documents have been supplied relating to the prosecution of
             Winefredo Trasga for an 'Act of Lasciviousness' committed
             against the Appellant in June 2016 [see AB pages 47 et seq].
             In an interview with the office of Women and Children
             Protection [see Judicial Affidavit exhibited at pages 50 - 51]
             [the appellant] gives a lucid and detailed account of the
             incident, including the precise time and date that it
             occurred. This is not suggestive of a person whose 'Cognitive
             status including attention and concentration are below that
             expected of her age' (per Valerie Andora-Quilaton MD) or
             someone with receptive and expressive language skills
             equivalent to age 6 (per Celina Cordero-Gellada MD).  It is
             claimed that [the appellant] 'has already been subject to
             sexual assault due to her vulnerability'. Only two such
             incidents have been recorded, both with the same perpetrator.
             Those incidents of predatory behaviour - which both took place
             some three years ago - have been addressed by the authorities
             in the Philippines. They do not seem to have been facilitated
             by any gullibility or obliviousness to danger on the part of
             the Appellant. The Judicial Affidavit makes it clear that the
             accused neighbour entered the house uninvited. On the second
             occasion he asked [the appellant] to go to the comfort room
             [the bathroom] 'which I refused but he pulled me and dragged
             me to the CR' [AB page 50].

18. The Judge was critical as to there being no medical evidence predating
    2014 filed with the Tribunal:

         '30. No medical evidence has been placed before me bearing a date
             any earlier than January 2014, when [the appellant] was 19
             years old. It is frankly astonishing that this should be the
             case if the Appellant has genuinely been suffering from
             developmental problems since birth. In my judgment the claim
             that her daughter has learning difficulties was a 'final throw
             of the dice' on the part of the Sponsor, having been
             unsuccessful in bringing [the appellant] to this country on
             two previous occasions. I am not satisfied, on the balance of
             probabilities, that the applicant requires long-term personal
             care to perform everyday tasks as a result of disability.'

19. Having found that the appellant does not require long-term personal
    care to perform everyday tasks as a result of disability the Judge
    considered the appellant's appeal in the alternative. The Judge
    observed the evidence of TK that she has continued to hire a Yaya, or
    carer, to care for the appellant following the departure of KK. The
    Yaya had been employed to look after various children of TK since 2010.
    The Judge found at [38] of her decision that there was nothing to
    indicate that the appellant had been receiving any care in the
    Philippines over and above that supplied by her Yaya. Further, at [39]
    the Judge found that the appellant had not established that she was
    unable, even with the practical and financial help of her mother and
    stepfather in the United Kingdom, to obtain the required level of care
    from a hired carer in the Philippines.

20. The Judge proceeded to consider the appellant under article 8 and
    determined that the legitimate aim of proper immigration control is not
    outweighed by the family life rights of the appellant and her mother:

         '45. The Appellant and her mother have lived apart for nearly nine
             years, [TK] having come to the UK in September 2010.  I do not
             accept that [the appellant] has mental and physical challenges
             such that the level of her dependency is necessarily greater
             than would ordinarily be the case for adult offspring. In my
             judgment there is no family life as between the Appellant and
             her mother for Article 8 purposes.

         46.  Even if I am wrong in this assessment, the decision is in
             accordance with the law and in pursuit of a legitimate aim,
             namely the need to maintain an effective system of immigration
             control. The issue is therefore one of proportionality.  I
             remind myself that it is necessary to have regard to Part 5A
             of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and in
             particular to the factors at section 117B.

         47.  The separation between the Sponsor and the Appellant was
             occasioned by [TK] exercising the choice of living and working
             in England rather than in her own country of origin. She is
             entitled to exercise that choice. However, the Appellant's
             mother could reasonably be expected to go back to the
             Philippines to provide the emotional and practical support her
             daughter is said to need. That would mean [TK's husband] being
             faced with the choice of accompanying his wife or remaining in
             the UK. I recognise that he has employment and elderly parents
             in this country [WS �7]. However, he has not advanced any
             particular reason why he could not move to the Philippines, a
             country he has visited 'not less than 20 times', according to
             his wife [WS �12].

         48.  The Appellant continues to live in the home in which she has
             resided since birth [see application form Q24].  Family
             members from the United Kingdom are in a position to visit
             [the appellant] on a regular basis, albeit that they would not
             be residing with her permanently. They can keep in touch via
             modern methods of communication in the same way that they do
             now.'

Grounds of appeal

21. The original grounds of appeal run to 28 paragraphs over eight pages.
    There was no effort to particularise the grounds of challenge, rather
    the author of the grounds adopted the approach of working their way
    through the paragraphs of the decision and challenging issues as and
    when they arose. As observed by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam, this
    Tribunal expects grounds seeking permission to appeal to specify
    clearly and coherently, with appropriate particulars, the error(s) of
    law said to contaminate the decision under challenge. Unparticularised
    and unfocused grounds place unnecessary demands on the judiciary. As
    observed by the President in Nixon (permission to appeal: grounds)
    [2014] UKUT 00368 (IAC) poorly compiled applications risk undermining
    the important value of legal certainty and causing unfairness to the
    other party.

22. By means of his re-drafted grounds Mr Malik accepts that the Judge
    unimpeachably found that the appellant did not meet the requirements of
    the adult dependent relative provisions in Appendix FM, particularly as
    to the appellant not requiring long-term personal care and that such
    care was available or affordable in the Philippines.  The crux of the
    appeal now advanced is that the findings of the Judge did not extend,
    as they ought to have done, to a full consideration of facts relevant
    to article 8. The re-drafted grounds detail, inter alia:

         '9.  At [17]-[19] of the Determination, the judge appeared to be
             unimpressed by the two medical letters of Dr Danilo V
             Valencia, on the basis that the 'manifestations of
             intellectual impairment [had] been reported to him rather than
             witnesses' and that he did not have 'expertise in the field of
             emotional and behavioural disorder or learning disability.
             Those findings are admittedly unimpeachable. There were
             however other aspects of the report that were not explored,
             for example, the fact that the Appellant tended to suffer from
             a number of medical ailments and required 'hired help' to
             manage her medications and that the diligence of the 'helper'
             appeared to be poor.  This omission is underscored by the fact
             that at [20] the judge appeared to accept that the Appellant
             had 'difficulty in everyday activities' but concluded that
             such difficulty did not mean that she could not perform the
             tasks without help.

         10.  At [23] of the Determination, the judge considered documentary
             evidence from a paediatrician, namely Ms Celina Cordero-
             Gellada, which was to the effect that the Appellant had sub-
             normal gross and fine motor skills, and similarly sub-normal
             language and social skills. At [24] the judge appeared to
             reject Ms Celina Cordero-Gellada's findings in relation to
             gross and fine motor skills because there was no mention of
             the Appellant having problems with gross and fine motor skills
             in the evidence of the Appellant's mother. At [25] the judge
             furthermore appeared to reject Ms Cordero-Gellada's evidence
             in relation to the Appellant's language skills by reference to
             the Appellant's text exchanges with her mother. Those findings
             are admittedly unimpeachable. However at [24] the judge
             considered but omitted to make findings on the Appellant's
             mother's evidence that the Appellant would not always dress
             appropriately; needed prompting to complete tasks such as
             washing herself, and taking medication, and could not cook or
             clean for herself.

         11.  At [27] the judge made a clear finding that the court
             documents in relation to an alleged sexual assault on the
             Appellant did not prove that she had 'no sense of danger'.
             That finding was admittedly unimpeachable per se, however, the
             judge omitted to make a finding on whether it was in fact
             true, wholly or to a degree, that the Appellant was indeed
             vulnerable because of a diminished 'sense of danger'.

         12.  Thus, although there were sufficient unimpeachable findings to
             sustain the judge's conclusion that the appeal be dismissed in
             relation to the ADR provisions, the enquiry in relation to the
             engagement of and proportionality under Article 8 was
             incomplete, because important findings relevant to the degree
             of the Appellant's dependency on her mother and sponsor, were
             omitted.

         13.  The judge's statement at [45] that 'I do not accept that [the
             appellant] has physical and mental challenges such that the
             level of her dependency is necessarily greater than would
             ordinarily be the case for adult offspring' was - respectfully
             - a rather 'hollow' statement because no clear findings were
             made on what exactly the Appellant's level of challenges were
             from an Article 8 perspective. In light of the judge's
             findings in relation to the ADR provisions, clear findings
             were needed on whether the Appellant's impediments and
             vulnerability were simply insufficiently evidenced from a
             medical perspective; exaggerated (and therefore to some degree
             true); or simply fabricates. UTJ McWilliams made the same
             point in granting permission.'

23. No Rule 24 response was filed by the respondent.

Decision

24. At the outset of the hearing I informed the representatives that I
    considered a further 'obvious' ground of appeal arose upon
    consideration of the Judge's decision. I observe that it is reasonable
    to expect professional representatives to set out appeal grounds with
    an appropriate degree of particularity and legibility and a Tribunal
    should be hesitant in forensically examining the decision to identify
    grounds beyond those advanced by a professional representative.
    However, there remains a duty upon the Tribunal to consider points that
    are obvious: R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte
    Robinson [1997] 3 WLR 1162. The Tribunal enjoys a power to consider any
    other point arising from a decision if the interests of justice so
    require.

25. In this matter, the Judge directed herself at [42] of her decision that
    she was only able to consider article 8 as it related to circumstances
    pertaining as at the date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision of
    25 May 2018. In making her self-direction the Judge expressly relied
    upon the Court of Appeal judgment in Gurung v ECO, New Delhi [2016]
    EWCA Civ 358 per Underhill LJ, at [17]

         '... The decision under appeal was, as regards article 8 as much as
         the policy issue, the ECO's decision of 12 March 2012; and the
         relevant circumstances were thus, in accordance with Section
         85A(2), those appertaining at the date of that decision.'

26. The Court of Appeal in Gurung was concerned with an earlier, and
    different, statutory regime concerning article 8 and entry clearance
    applications. By means of section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 ('the 2002 Act') in an appeal under section 82(1)
    the Tribunal can consider evidence about any matter which it thinks is
    relevant to the substance of the decision including evidence which
    concerns a matter arising after the date of decision. From 23 May 2011
    until 20 October 2014 section 85(4) of the 2002 Act was subject to the
    exceptions contained in section 85A which was brought into force by
    section 19 of the UK Borders Act 2009. The result of the statutory
    amendment was that in appeals against the refusal of entry clearance
    the Tribunal could only consider the circumstances appertaining at the
    time of the decision. I observe that section 85A of the 2002 Act was
    repealed by Schedule 9 of the Immigration Act 2014 as from 20 October
    2014 and the relevant saving provisions are not relevant to this
    appeal. Consequent to the amended statutory regime, as the appellant
    enjoys a right of appeal on human rights grounds against the
    respondent's decision she enjoys the benefits provided by section 85(4)
    of the 2002 Act, namely that the Tribunal may consider any matter it
    thinks relevant to the substance of the decision including a matter
    arising after the date of decision. The Judge therefore erred in law in
    restricting her consideration of article 8 at [42] of her decision. The
    question that arises is whether such error was material.

27. By way of his grounds of appeal Mr Malik accepted that much of the
    Judge's decision is unimpeachable. It may be said that there appears to
    have been a lack of focus in the approach adopted by those who
    previously represented the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal. I
    clearly note at this point that Mr Malik was not the appellant's
    representative before that Tribunal. It is unclear as to whether any
    express reliance was placed upon the family life that the appellant
    enjoyed with her brother, KK, who had cared for her in the Philippines
    prior to his securing settlement in this country. However, her
    relationship with her brother was raised in the grounds of appeal and
    was also addressed in TK's evidence. I observe �27 of TK's witness
    statement dated 31 May 2019 which states:

         'I have no peace of mind being here in the UK, leaving [the
         appellant] in the hands of another person.  [KK] has been in the
         Philippines since March 2019 to be with [the appellant]. He is
         returning to the UK at the end of July 2019.'

28. The Judge may not have been aided by those representing the appellant
    but the family life between KK and the appellant, with the history of
    KK having cared for his sister, was an element to be considered within
    the proportionality assessment: Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2008] UKHL 39; [2009] 1 AC 115. It is unclear as
    to whether the Judge did not consider KK's article 8 rights because it
    was not expressly relied upon before her or because she had taken as
    her starting point that she could not consider factual issues arising
    after the date of the ECO's decision in May 2018 and KK was residing
    with the appellant in the Philippines after this point in time.
    However, I am satisfied that the error of law in the Judge relying upon
    a statutory provision that has been repealed is material in
    circumstances where relevant evidence postdating that decision was not
    expressly considered. I am satisfied that the Judge materially erred in
    law.

Remaking the Decision

29. The representatives addressed me as to whether I could re-make this
    decision. I conclude that in circumstances where the Judge had given no
    consideration to the article 8 rights of KK it would be appropriate for
    this matter to be reconsidered by the First-tier Tribunal so that KK's
    rights can be considered as well as those of the appellant and her
    mother.

30. Mr Malik was content that there be preserved findings of fact,
    observing that he was content that everything from [15] to [41] of the
    Judge's decision should stand.

31. Upon careful consideration of the Judge's decision, I am not in
    agreement with Mr. Malik. Whilst the approach to the expertise of Dr
    Valencia is lawful, the Judge failed to expressly consider the weight
    that should be given to the expert evidence of the psychiatrist, Ms.
    Andora-Quilaton. Rather, she adversely observes that Ms. Andora-
    Quilaton's understanding of the appellant's situation was reliant upon
    information given by KK. There appears to be no justifiable concern as
    to KK providing such information if he is credible, and I note that the
    Judge makes no assessment as to his credibility. Observations are also
    made as to the clinical terminology used by Ms. Andora-Quilaton, though
    the Judge is not an expert in psychiatry and provides no explanation as
    to why the terms utilised are 'odd'. Importantly, no clear finding of
    fact is made as to Ms. Andora-Quilaton's evidence, and so contrary to
    Mr. Malik's suggestion there are no findings of fact that can be
    preserved at [21]-[22] of the decision.

32. Further, I am not in agreement with Mr. Malik's observation at �10 of
    his grounds of appeal that the Judge's assessment of the evidence of a
    paediatrician, Ms. Cordero-Gellada, is 'unimpeachable'. The Judge has
    decided at [24] to accept the evidence of the appellant's mother over
    that of an expert paediatrician without engaging with the specific
    diagnosis of Ms. Cordero-Gelladam at [23], which is not inconsistent
    with a child (as the appellant was in 2014) being able to dress herself
    or brush her teeth. There is no explanation at all as to why a child
    dressed stylishly in a photograph cannot have the motor skill
    deficiency identified by an expert paediatrician. I am satisfied that
    the Judge's conclusion at [24] is materially erroneous in law by a
    failure to reasonably assess the expert evidence and to provide
    adequate reasons for rejecting it.

33. Though I undertake no detailed assessment of [27] of the decision, as I
    intend to set aside all of the Judge's findings of fact, I observe that
    the failure to adequately consider the expert evidence of Ms. Cordero-
    Gelladam as to the appellant's expressive language skills adversely
    impacts upon the Judge's reasoning as to why the appellant has no sense
    of danger.

Notice of Decision

34. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision promulgated on
    19 July 2019 pursuant to Section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

35. This matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing
    before any Judge sitting at the FtT Hatton Cross other than Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Courtney.

36. No findings of fact are preserved.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

37. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise, no report of
    these proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall directly or
    indirectly identify the appellant or her family members. This direction
    applies to amongst others the appellant and the respondent. Any failure
    to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt of court
    proceedings.
