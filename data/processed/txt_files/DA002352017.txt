               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:           No appearance
For the respondent:          Mr I. Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed the respondent's decision dated 05  April  2017
      to remove him from the UK on public policy grounds under regulation 27
      of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA
      Regulations 2016").

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell allowed the appeal  in  a  decision
      promulgated on 05 December 2017. In a decision promulgated on 16 March
      2018 the Upper Tribunal found that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
      failing to give adequate reasons for concluding that the  highest  '10
      years' continuous residence' threshold for  removal  applied  and  set
      aside the decision (annexed). The Tribunal outlined the law as it then
      stood  in  relation  to  the  '10  year'  assessment  and  made  clear
      directions to the appellant explaining the issues that he  would  need
      to address by way of evidence at the resumed hearing. The  appeal  was
      listed for a resumed hearing on 11 June 2018. The appellant failed  to
      comply with the  previous  directions.  The  parties  agreed  that  an
      adjournment was necessary for the appellant to formulate his case in a
      way that the respondent  could  understand  and  respond  to.  Further
      directions were made for the appellant to  serve  a  detailed  witness
      statement and a chronology of events for the Upper Tribunal to  assess
      whether he had acquired a right of permanent residence in the  UK  for
      the purpose of the '10 years'  continuous  residence'  test.  By  that
      stage, the Court of Justice of  the  European  Union  had  issued  its
      judgment in B v Land Baden-Wï¿½rtemberg and SSHD v Vomero [2018] EUECJ C-
      316/16 confirming that permanent residence was a prerequisite  to  the
      highest level of protection against expulsion.

3.     On  30  July  2018  the  appellant's   legal   representatives,   TNA
      Solicitors, confirmed that they were "withdrawing  from  representing"
      the appellant. After a further adjournment, the appeal was listed  for
      hearing on 13 November 2018. There was no appearance by or  on  behalf
      of the appellant. I noted that  he  had  attended  previous  hearings.
      There was no message or correspondence from the appellant.  There  was
      no adjournment request. I was satisfied that the notice of hearing was
      sent to his last known address. Mr  Jarvis  also  made  enquiries  and
      confirmed  that  the  Home  Office  notes   recorded   the   following
      information:

         "Subject has attended Becket House today with a  fitness  for  work
         statement, reason given is mental health for 8 weeks.


         I telephoned [name] in the absence of [name] to check if it was ok
         for the subject to Voluntarily Depart due to being DO  signed,  and
         he was of the opinion that this was ok, subject is an EEC national.


         Subject will be departing  Dover  Eastern  docks  at  13:45  on  10
         November 2018 by Blueline Bus Ref: BL47051YX Praha - UAN Florenc"

4.    The notes indicate that the appellant may have left the country on  10
      November 2018. An appeal under the EEA Regulations 2016 is not treated
      as abandoned if the appellant leaves the UK. However, in light of this
      information I was satisfied that it was unlikely  that  the  appellant
      would attend the hearing  and  that  there  were  no  grounds  for  an
      adjournment. I was satisfied that I could proceed to hear  the  appeal
      in his absence.

5.          In the absence of the appellant or any other witnesses,  I  have
      considered the documentary evidence contained  in  the  three  bundles
      served on his behalf during the course of these proceedings,  as  well
      as the documents contained in the Home Office bundle.



Decision and reasons

6.    The appellant and his  sister  gave  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and  were  found  to  be  generally  credible  witnesses.  The
    appellant prepared a witness statement in support of the appeal  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. However, the appellant's statement is  general
    in nature and does not contain detail on relevant issues, which is  why
    the Upper Tribunal directed him to produce a more  detailed  statement.
    The appellant failed to comply with the direction. He  did  not  attend
    the hearing to give evidence about his life in the UK. I must determine
    the appeal on the limited evidence currently before the Upper Tribunal.



Level of protection

7.    Regulation 27 of the EEA Regulations 2016  provides  three  levels  of
    protection against expulsion on public policy grounds.  The  respondent
    can make a 'relevant decision' to expel an EEA national from the UK  on
    "grounds of public policy,  public  security  or  public  health".  The
    decision must comply with the principle of proportionality. It must  be
    based exclusively on the personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned,
    which must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. Before taking  a
    'relevant decision' the respondent must take account of  considerations
    such as the age, state of health, family, length of residence  and  the
    person's economic situation as well as the extent of his links  to  his
    country of origin. This is the  minimum  level  of  protection  against
    expulsion.

8.    In the case of  a  person  who  has  acquired  a  right  of  permanent
    residence the respondent  can  only  expel  the  person  if  there  are
    "serious grounds of public policy, public security or  public  health".
    In the case of a person who has resided in  the  UK  for  a  continuous
    period of at least 10  years  prior  to  the  'relevant  decision'  the
    respondent can only expel the person if there are  "imperative  grounds
    of public security".

9.    The Court of Justice  of  the  European  Union  has  made  clear  that
    permanent residence is a  prerequisite  to  establishing  a  continuous
    period of 10 years' residence to benefit  from  the  highest  level  of
    protection from expulsion: see Vomero. In assessing the 10-year  period
    it is also necessary to consider whether any integrating links with the
    UK might have been broken by periods of imprisonment. One can see  from
    this synopsis of the law that the highest level of  protection  against
    expulsion is not available simply because a person has lived in the  UK
    for  a  chronological  period  of  10  years.  The  protection  against
    expulsion  is  directly  linked  to  the  extent  that  a  person   has
    established rights under EU law and the  extent  of  their  integrating
    links to the UK.

10.   The appellant is a Slovakian national. The exact date when he  entered
    the UK is unclear, but he says that he entered with his parents in 2005
    when he was around 14 years old. It is reasonable  to  infer  that,  at
    that age, the appellant was likely to be living with  his  parents.  At
    that time,  as  Slovakian  nationals,  his  parents  were  required  to
    register under the Accession State Worker Scheme. There is evidence  to
    show that the appellant's parents registered under the scheme in  2005.
    There is some evidence in the form of P60 and P45 certificates to  show
    that his parents may have carried out some work  during  2005-2006  but
    there  is  no  evidence  to  indicate  a  consistent  pattern  of  work
    thereafter. A letter from the appellant's mother to  the  Secretary  of
    State indicates that his father may have worked until 2008 but there is
    no evidence to support this statement. The appellant's mother  asserted
    that he gave up work to care for her but there is little or no evidence
    to show the  extent  of  her  condition  or  to  show  whether  it  was
    sufficiently serious to show a permanent incapacity to work. The weight
    of the evidence indicates  that  it  is  likely  that  the  appellant's
    parents have been largely dependent on state support for most of  their
    time in the UK.

11.   I have considered whether the appellant acquired a right of  permanent
    residence in his own right. The appellant says that he went  to  school
    and then attended Thanet College. He has  produced  evidence  from  the
    school to confirm that he attended The Royal Harbour Academy from 2006-
    2008. Educational certificates from Thanet College indicate that he was
    studying there  from  2009-2011.  The  appellant  was  studying  for  a
    continuous period of five years but there is insufficient  evidence  to
    show that he acquired a permanent right of residence on this basis.  To
    acquire a right of permanent residence the appellant would need to show
    that he  lived  in  the  UK  "in  accordance  with"  the  relevant  EEA
    Regulations for a continuous period of five years. An  EEA  student  is
    only a 'qualified person' for the purpose of the EEA Regulations if  he
    has comprehensive sickness insurance and is not a burden on the  social
    assistance system. There is no evidence to show that the appellant  met
    those requirements  during  the  period  from  2006-2011  when  he  was
    studying in the UK. There is no evidence to show that the appellant has
    worked in the UK or that he has resided  in  accordance  with  the  EEA
    Regulations as a worker for the required period. For  these  reasons  I
    conclude that the appellant has failed to show that he acquired a right
    of permanent residence in his own right.

12.   I have considered whether the appellant might have acquired  permanent
    residence as a 'family member' of EEA nationals  exercising  rights  of
    free movement in the UK either (i) as a direct descendant while he  was
    under 21 years old or (ii) as a dependent. The appellant says that  his
    problems began when he began a relationship with Czech national  called
    [DO], who "got me into drugs". His statement  does  not  say  when  the
    relationship started, but a chronology of events indicates that it  may
    have  been  in  2013.  The  appellant  says  that  he  lived  with  his
    girlfriend, but again, no date is given as to when he moved out of  the
    family home. Although the evidence is vague, it seems likely  that  the
    appellant was living in the family home with his parents until at least
    2013. However, to qualify as a direct descendent under 21 years old  he
    needs to show that his parents were exercising rights of free  movement
    in the UK. Although there  is  some  evidence  to  indicate  that  they
    registered under the Accession State  Worker  Scheme  when  they  first
    arrived in the UK and may have worked for a short period of  time,  the
    evidence falls far short of showing that his parents  exercised  rights
    of free movement or were residing in accordance with other  aspects  of
    the regulations for a  continuous  period  of  five  years.  For  these
    reasons I conclude that the  appellant  has  failed  to  show  that  he
    acquired a right of permanent residence as a 'family member'.

13.   The appellant could only qualify as a dependent of his siblings as  an
    'extended family member' under regulation 8 because he is not a 'direct
    descendent' for the purpose of regulation 7. There is some evidence  to
    show that his brother and sister registered to work, but  the  evidence
    falls far short of showing that he was dependent  upon  either  one  of
    them let alone for a continuous period of five years. Even  if  he  was
    able to show dependency he could only  acquire  a  permanent  right  of
    residence if he had been issued with a residence card as  an  'extended
    family member' and would therefore be treated as a 'family  member'  by
    operation of regulation 7(3). Only those who  are  treated  as  'family
    members' can acquire a right of permanent  residence  under  regulation
    15(1)(b). There is no evidence to show that he  has  ever  been  issued
    with a residence card as an 'extended family member'. For these reasons
    I conclude that the appellant has failed to show  that  he  acquired  a
    right of permanent residence as a dependent of his siblings.

14.   It follows from these findings that  there  is  insufficient  evidence
    before the Tribunal to show that the appellant benefits from the higher
    level of protection from expulsion afforded to those who have  acquired
    a right of permanent residence ("serious grounds").  Having  failed  to
    show that he acquired permanent residence, following Vomero, he is also
    unable to show that he is entitled to the highest level  of  protection
    ("imperative grounds"). The respondent need only show  that  there  are
    grounds of public policy, public security and public health to  justify
    his removal from the UK.

15.   The appellant's antecedents show that he was convicted of  interfering
    with a vehicle in November 2009 and sentenced to a 12-month conditional
    discharge. He was 19 years old at  the  date  of  the  conviction.  The
    appellant's claim that his problems began when he was drawn  into  drug
    use by a girlfriend in 2013 is borne out by his offending  history.  He
    had no further convictions until 2013 when he was convicted for various
    minor offences relating to  handling  stolen  goods,  possession  of  a
    controlled drug, breaches of a conditional discharge and several counts
    of theft (shoplifting). The nature of the offences is  consistent  with
    someone who was thieving to fund a drug habit.  However,  none  of  the
    offences were sufficiently serious  to  be  dealt  with  by  way  of  a
    custodial sentence, nor  are  they  serious  enough,  taken  alone,  to
    justify his expulsion from the UK on public policy grounds.

16.   The offence that prompted the decision  to  remove  the  appellant  on
    public policy grounds was a far more serious conviction in  2016,  when
    he was sentenced to a total of  42  months'  (3  years  and  6  months)
    imprisonment for supply of class A drugs (crack  cocaine)  and  several
    counts of "conceal/disguise/convert/transfer" of criminal property. The
    judge's sentencing remarks indicate that the appellant  pleaded  guilty
    at the first opportunity. They give an indication of the nature of  the
    offences, but  neither  the  sentencing  remarks  nor  the  appellant's
    statement provide any specific  information  about  the  offences.  The
    sentencing remarks were as follows:

         "Class A drugs - little more need be said about the seriousness  of
         that. I apply the guidelines of course, and I take note of the  way
         in which the prosecution put it and it is a lesser role in category
         3. But there is a real seriousness  in  the  persistent  dishonesty
         indicated in many counts of transferring  criminal  property  which
         you were involved in almost on a day-to-day basis; not over a great
         long time, but nevertheless you were very close to  the  wheels  of
         criminality going round, committed no doubt  by  others:  burglary,
         people's cards, people's personal property being  taken,  and  most
         significantly - and this is not addressed in the  guidelines,  [by]
         the taking and use of other people's passports. It  is  well  known
         that  that  gives  rise  to  further  serious  criminality  in  the
         community, and that is a  matter  which  to  my  understanding  and
         judgment is an aggravating feature. So the transferring of criminal
         property counts, given their persistence and the  nature  of  them,
         are very serious offences which cross the custody  threshold  quite
         clearly in themselves. You were very busy over that period of time,
         and in addition of course there is the class A drugs offence.


         Your record is one, sadly, which has the  profile  of  someone  who
         takes drugs himself, and I accept that that is the case, but it  is
         a record nonetheless. You are not a person by any  stretch  of  the
         imagination of previous good character. .....I  do  recognise  that
         you have  made  some  progress  as  far  as  your  drugs  habit  is
         concerned, and that is encouraging.  I  hope  you  can  put  things
         behind you. It won't be easy of course, in particular because I  am
         afraid you are going to prison, but there is it; I have  to  do  my
         duty and that means not just helping you, although of course judges
         help defendants as far as they can all the time, but when it is  as
         serious as this I am afraid there can be no alternative. And I have
         to look to the victims of crime.  Fairness  is  not  always  wholly
         associated with the interests of a defendant but the  interests  of
         victims and of the general public who suffer from these matters."

17.    The  serious  nature  of  drugs  offences  on  society  is   obvious;
    especially in cases involve the supply of class A drugs. In  this  case
    there  was  associated   criminality,   whereby   the   appellant   was
    transferring the property from other criminal offences to fund his drug
    habit. The serious nature of the offences he committed is reflected  in
    the length of the sentence. Until that point,  the  appellant's  record
    involved petty offending, but the criminality funding his drug use  had
    clearly escalated into  far  more  serious  offending  by  2016.  I  am
    satisfied that the serious nature of the later offences  is  sufficient
    to engage the lowest  threshold  for  removal  on  grounds  of  "public
    policy". However, other considerations need to be  taken  into  account
    before removal can be justified.

Other considerations

18.   It is only if the personal conduct of the person  concerned  is  found
    to  represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society that  it  becomes
    relevant to consider whether the decision is proportionate taking  into
    account the considerations identified in regulation 27(5)-(6)  and  the
    further public policy considerations contained in Schedule 1 of the EEA
    Regulations 2016: see SSHD v Straszewski [2015] EWCA Civ  1245  and  MC
    (Essa principles recast) [2015] UKUT 520 in  the  context  of  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006.

19.   The appellant says that he was drawn into drug use by  his  girlfriend
    and it seems clear from his antecedents that this is at the root of his
    offending  behaviour.  Although  his  earlier  convictions  were   less
    serious, they indicate that the appellant  was  willing  to  engage  in
    criminality on a regular basis to fund his drug habit.  The  subsequent
    conviction showed a serious escalation in his offending behaviour.  The
    description of the property offences indicates persistent  and  regular
    criminal behaviour.

20.   The sentencing judge noted that the appellant expressed  an  intention
    to address his addiction.  The  appellant's  statement  says  that  his
    period in prison helped him to realise how things had  gone  wrong.  He
    made a mistake and deeply regretted it. He has realised the  importance
    of his family. He said that he would not take  drugs  or  steal  again.
    There is some evidence to show that the appellant has taken some  steps
    to address his drug use. A letter  from  East  Kent  Drug  and  Alcohol
    Recovery Services dated 04 July 2016 states that  that  he  attended  a
    service called Turning Point between April 2013 and  June  2016.  Their
    electronic records indicated, at that stage, that  he  had  given  drug
    free urine tests since November 2015. This does not mean  that  he  was
    drug free from April 2013 because clearly he wasn't. Nearly all of  his
    convictions were for offences committed during 2013-2015. Nevertheless,
    it is an indication that after he was arrested  for  the  most  serious
    offence he took steps to tackle his drug addiction. There  is  evidence
    to show that he attended a RAPt (Rehabilitation for Addicted  Prisoners
    Trust) rehabilitation course while in prison.

21.   It is unclear when the appellant  was  released  from  prison,  but  a
    rough estimation based on the length of his sentence indicates that  it
    is likely that he was released on licence halfway through his sentenced
    i.e. in early 2018. Correspondence on the court file indicates that  he
    was moved into immigration detention in January 2018 and  was  released
    on immigration bail on 05 February 2018.

22.   At the date of the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  the  appellant  was
    still serving his sentence. Because the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    erroneously concentrated  on  whether  the  appellant's  offending  was
    sufficiently serious to overcome  the  "imperative  grounds"  threshold
    there is no analysis of the appellant's rehabilitation or likelihood of
    reoffending. The appellant would have  been  released  on  licence  but
    there is no information from his Offender Manager  or  any  information
    about the terms of his licence.

23.   It is common for appellants to express regret when faced with the  one
    of the consequences  of  their  criminal  behaviour  i.e.  deportation.
    Whether the appellant's intention to reform is genuine is difficult  to
    assess without hearing from him in person. He chose not to  attend  the
    hearing and did not serve an up to date statement.

24.   There is no evidence to show how he has fared since his  release  from
    prison, when the stresses and strains of ordinary life might  challenge
    any progress he might have made in relation to his drug  addiction.  Mr
    Jarvis accepted that there is no evidence to show  that  the  appellant
    has been convicted of further offences. However, I  take  into  account
    the fact that he has only  been  released  from  detention  for  a  few
    months. In the absence of any up to date evidence from the appellant or
    an opportunity to speak to him to assess his  resolve  to  remain  drug
    free, it is too early to tell whether he  has  been  rehabilitated.  In
    short, I find that the  appellant  has  failed  to  produce  sufficient
    evidence to show that the underlying cause of his  offending  behaviour
    has in fact been addressed to the extent that he no longer represents a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.

25.   The appellant is a 27-year-old Romani man from Slovakia who has  lived
    in the UK for a period of 13 years. He entered the UK when  he  was  14
    years old with other close family members. The appellant says that  his
    mother  wanted  to  move  to  a  place  where  they  would  face   less
    discrimination as Romani people.  The  appellant  attended  school  and
    college, but  the  evidence  indicates  that  he  did  not  obtain  any
    significant qualifications. There is no evidence to show that  he  used
    any skills that he had to obtain regular work after  he  completed  his
    studies in 2011. There is little or no evidence to  show  that  he  has
    engaged any EU rights since he  has  lived  in  the  UK.  Instead,  the
    evidence shows that he was drawn into drug use and  was  likely  to  be
    living  on  the  margins  of  society,  relying  initially   on   petty
    criminality to fund  his  habit,  before  moving  on  to  more  serious
    offending behaviour.

26.   I accept that the focus of the appellant's family life is  in  the  UK
    and that other members of his family seem to  have  formed  integrating
    links to this country. However, apart from the mere fact of his  length
    of residence, there is little evidence to indicate that  the  appellant
    has formed any  significant  integrating  links.  In  contrast  to  the
    situation at the date of the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing,  when  the
    appellant was still in prison, neither the appellant  nor  any  of  his
    family members attended this hearing. The appellant is not married  and
    has no children. There is no evidence to  indicate  that  he  is  in  a
    serious relationship with a person who has a right remain  in  the  UK.
    The evidence indicates that he may have left the country to  travel  to
    Prague. I note that he told Judge Buckwell that his girlfriend, who  he
    claimed he was no longer with, was deported to the Czech Republic.  The
    appellant's life in the UK has not engaged  rights  of  free  movement.
    There is no evidence to show that he has  worked  or  earned  a  living
    here. The evidence shows that for the last five years he has  struggled
    with drug addiction,  and  as  a  result,  became  a  persistent  petty
    offender leading to more serious criminality by 2016.

27.   After having considered the evidence in the round I am satisfied  that
    the nature of  the  appellant's  offending  behaviour  is  sufficiently
    serious to engage the lowest threshold for removal on grounds of public
    policy. The earlier offences, although not sufficient taken alone, form
    part of the picture leading to more serious offending. I conclude  that
    the  nature  of  that  offending  represents  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society. I bear in  mind  that  his  past  convictions  are  not  in
    themselves sufficient to justify the decision. Although there  is  some
    evidence to indicate that the appellant took some steps to address  his
    addiction while in prison his failure  to  attend  the  hearing  or  to
    produce up to date evidence since his release from detention means that
    I cannot be satisfied that he has addressed these problems sufficiently
    to reduce the risk of reoffending. After  having  taken  what  evidence
    there is of the appellant's individual circumstances  into  account,  I
    conclude that the decision to remove him on public  policy  grounds  is
    proportionate on the facts of this case.

28.   For the reasons given above I conclude that  the  'relevant  decision'
    is in accordance with the EEA Regulations 2016.

29.   Although the Home Office notes indicate that the appellant might  have
    left the country, it seems likely that he will come to know the content
    of this decision through his family members. The address on  the  court
    file is that of his family home. The appellant should be aware that the
    effect of the EEA removal decision ('deportation order') dated 05 April
    2017 is to prohibit him from returning to the UK so long as  the  order
    is in force. Regulation 34 of the EEA Regulations 2016  states  that  a
    person may only apply for revocation of the order if there has  been  a
    material change in the circumstances that justified making  the  order.
    Article 32 of the Qualification Directive (2004/38/EC)  states  that  a
    person who is excluded on  grounds  of  public  policy  may  submit  an
    application for lifting an exclusion order after a  reasonable  period,
    depending on the circumstances, and in any  event,  after  three  years
    from enforcement of the final exclusion order.

DECISION

The appeal under the EEA Regulations 2016 is DISMISSED

For the appellant:     Mr T. Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Ms V. Cross of TNA Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    For the sake of convenience, I will refer to the parties as they  were
      before the First-tier Tribunal although  the  Secretary  of  State  is
      technically the appellant before the Upper Tribunal.

2.    The appellant is a Slovakian national who entered the UK in 2005  with
      his parents and siblings. He was  14  years  old.  The  appellant  was
      convicted of several low-level offences in 2009, 2013 and 2015,  which
      did not meet the threshold for imprisonment. In December 2015  he  was
      convicted of supplying a controlled drug, for which he  was  sentenced
      to a total of three and a half years' imprisonment. The  Secretary  of
      State decided to remove the appellant on public policy  grounds  under
      regulation 27 of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
      2016 ("the EEA Regulations 2016") in a decision dated 05 April 2017.

3.    The appellant  appealed  against  the  removal  decision  taken  under
      regulations 23(6)(b) and  27  the  EEA  Regulations  2016.  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Buckwell allowed the appeal in a  decision  promulgated
      on 05 December 2017. The judge made the following findings:

         "60.     ... With respect  to  the  protective  threshold,  I  find
         without any doubt that the evidence confirms that the Appellant has
         spent at least 10 years in this country  and  therefore  Regulation
         27(4)(a) is applicable. The respondent has to show that there [are]
         imperative  grounds  of  public  security  which  apply  and  which
         therefore entitled the Respondent to make the relevant decision  to
         deport the Appellant.


         61.      Based on the totality of the evidence presented I  do  not
         find that the public security threshold has been  successfully  met
         by  the  Respondent.  Mr  Briant  himself  questioned  whether  the
         threshold could be met by the  Respondent  based  on  the  evidence
         which was before me. He was entirely  correct  in  expressing  that
         view. The public security issues have not been strongly asserted on
         behalf of the Respondent. Taking account of all the evidence  I  do
         not find that that risk has  been  established  on  behalf  of  the
         Respondent. I have fully taken into account the principles set  out
         within Regulation 27(5) of the EEA Regulations 2016  in  making  my
         assessment."

4.    The Secretary of State appealed the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on
      the following grounds:

      i) The First-tier Tribunal erred in approaching  the  ten-year  period
         for  enhanced  protection  against  removal  as  a  "purely  binary
         calculation" and failed to have regard to the principles set out in
         relevant case law as to how the ten-year period should be assessed:
         see SSHD v MG [2014] EUECJ C-400/12 and Warsame v SSHD [2016]  EWCA
         Civ 16.


     ii) At the date of the Upper Tribunal hearing the ground was refined to
         include the Opinion of Advocate General Szpunar in the cases of B v
         Land Baden Wï¿½rttemberg (C-316/16)  and  SSHD  v  Vomero  (C-424/16)
         (delivered 24 October 2017).

Legal Framework

5.    In Land Baden Wï¿½rttemberg v Tsakouridis (EU:C:2010:708) the  Court  of
    Justice of the European Union ruled:
         1.  Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive  2004/38/EC  of  the  European
             Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of
             citizens of the Union and their family  members  to  move  and
             reside freely  within  the  territory  of  the  Member  States
             amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing  Directives
             64/221/EEC,  68/360/EEC,  72/194/EEC,  73/148/EEC,  75/34/EEC,
             75/35/EEC,  90/364/EEC,  90/365/EEC  and  93/96/EEC  must   be
             interpreted as meaning that, in order to determine  whether  a
             Union citizen has resided in the host Member State for the  10
             years preceding the expulsion decision, which is the  decisive
             criterion  for  granting  enhanced   protection   under   that
             provision, all the relevant factors must be taken into account
             in each individual case, in particular the  duration  of  each
             period of absence from the host Member State,  the  cumulative
             duration and the frequency of those absences, and the  reasons
             why the person concerned left the host Member  State,  reasons
             which  may  establish  whether  those  absences  involve   the
             transfer to another State  of  the  centre  of  the  personal,
             family or occupational interests of the person concerned.

         2. Should the referring  court  conclude  that  the  Union  citizen
             concerned enjoys the protection of Article 28(3) of  Directive
             2004/38, that provision must be interpreted  as  meaning  that
             the  fight  against  crime  in  connection  with  dealing   in
             narcotics as part of an organised group is  capable  of  being
             covered by  the  concept  of  'imperative  grounds  of  public
             security' which  may  justify  a  measure  expelling  a  Union
             citizen who has resided in  the  host  Member  State  for  the
             preceding 10 years. Should the referring court  conclude  that
             the Union citizen concerned enjoys the protection  of  Article
             28(2) of Directive 2004/38, that provision must be interpreted
             as meaning that the fight against  crime  in  connection  with
             dealing in narcotics as part of an organised group is  covered
             by the concept of 'serious grounds of public policy or  public
             security'.

6.    In SSHD v MG (EU:C:2014:9) the Court of Justice of the European  Union
    ruled:

         1.   On   a   proper   construction   of   Article   28(3)(a)    of
             Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament  and  of  the
             Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union
             and their family members to move and reside freely within  the
             territory of the Member States amending  Regulation  (EEC)  No
             1612/68  and  repealing  Directives  64/221/EEC,   68/360/EEC,
             72/194/EEC,  73/148/EEC,  75/34/EEC,  75/35/EEC,   90/364/EEC,
             90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC,  the  10-year  period  of  residence
             referred  to  in  that  provision  must,  in   principle,   be
             continuous and must be calculated by counting  back  from  the
             date of the decision ordering  the  expulsion  of  the  person
             concerned.


         2. Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38  must  be  interpreted  as
             meaning that  a  period  of  imprisonment  is,  in  principle,
             capable both of interrupting the continuity of the  period  of
             residence for the purposes of that provision and of  affecting
             the decision regarding the grant of  the  enhanced  protection
             provided for  thereunder,  even  where  the  person  concerned
             resided in the host Member State for the  10  years  prior  to
             imprisonment. However, the fact that that  person  resided  in
             the host Member State for the 10 years prior  to  imprisonment
             may be  taken  into  consideration  as  part  of  the  overall
             assessment  required  in  order  to  determine   whether   the
             integrating links previously forged with the host Member State
             have been broken.

7.    In Warsame v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 16 the  Court  of  Appeal  concluded
    that the First-tier Tribunal erred in taking into  account  periods  of
    imprisonment in assessing whether the appellant had a continuous period
    of 10 years' residence in light of the Court of  Justice  decisions  in
    SSHD v MG (Portugal) (C400/12) EU:C:2014:9  and  Onukwere  v  SSHD  (C-
    378/12) EU:C:2014:13.

8.    In SSHD v Franco Vomero [2016] UKSC 49 the Supreme Court decided  that
    it was unable to come to a concluded view as to whether a person  needs
    to  acquire  a  right  of  permanent  residence  before  relying  on  a
    continuous period of 10  years  residence.  Lord  Mance  noted  that  a
    majority of the Court favoured the view that possession of a  right  of
    permanent  residence  is  not  needed  to  benefit  from  the  enhanced
    protection of the 10-year threshold. However, a minority of  the  Court
    regarded the position as unclear. As such, a referral was made  to  the
    Court of Justice for clarification.

9.    The Opinion of Advocate General Szpunar in B v Land Baden  Wï¿½rttemberg
    (C-316/16) and SSHD v Vomero (C-424/16) (EU:C:2017:797) concluded:

         128.     In the light of the foregoing  considerations,  I  propose
         that the Court answer the  questions  referred  for  a  preliminary
         ruling  by  the  Verwaltungsgerichtshof  Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg  (Higher
         Administrative Court, Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg, Germany) and  the  Supreme
         Court of the United Kingdom as follows:


             In Case C-424/16:


             (1) The acquisition of a right of permanent  residence  within
                  the meaning of Article 16 of Directive 2004/38/EC  of  the
                  European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on
                  the right of  citizens  of  the  Union  and  their  family
                  members to move and reside freely within the territory  of
                  the Member States, amending Regulation  (EEC)  No 1612/68
                  and   repealing   Directives    64/221/EEC,    68/360/EEC,
                  72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC,  90/364/EEC,
                  90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC, as amended  by  Regulation  (EU)
                  No 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
                  of 5 April 2011, is a prerequisite of  enjoying  enhanced
                  protection under Article 28(3)(a) of that directive.


             (2) The expression 'the previous 10 years' in Article 28(3)(a)
                  of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as referring to a
                  continuous period, calculated by  looking  back  from  the
                  precise time when the question of expulsion  arises,  that
                  includes any periods of absence or imprisonment,  provided
                  that none of those periods of absence or imprisonment  has
                  had the effect of breaking the integrative links with  the
                  host Member State.


             In Case C-316/16:


             When the question of expulsion arises,  it  is  necessary,  in
             order to determine whether enhanced protection  under  Article
             28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38, as  amended  by  Regulation  No
             492/2011, may or may not be  granted  following  a  period  of
             imprisonment, to carry out an overall assessment  in  concreto
             taking account of all relevant  factors,  in  each  individual
             case, relating to all  periods  of  presence  in  that  Member
             State, including periods of imprisonment, so as  to  ascertain
             whether a  period  of  imprisonment  has  had  the  effect  of
             breaking the integrative links with the host Member State over
             the previous 10 years.

Decision and reasons

10.   On the face of it, the First-tier Tribunal's finding at [60]  amounted
      to no more than a bare statement that the appellant had resided in the
      UK for a chronological period of 10  years.  The  sole  purpose  of  a
      decision is to give reasons for the  First-tier  Tribunal's  findings.
      Failure to give adequate  reasons  to  explain  findings  on  material
      issues is an error of law: see MK  (duty  to  give  reasons)  Pakistan
      [2013] UKUT 00641.

11.   However, in this case, whether the First-tier  Tribunal  was  required
      to give reasons for the bare  finding  depends  on  whether  a  formal
      concession was made by  the  respondent  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      hearing, and if so, what the terms of the concession were.

12.   On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Lindsay argued that  there  is
      no evidence to indicate that a formal concession was made.  On  behalf
      of the appellant, the rule 24 response asserts: "At  the  hearing  the
      SSHD presenting officer did concede that the Respondent met  10  years
      threshold."

13.   There is a distinct lack of evidence  from  both  parties  to  support
      their respective positions. Mr Lindsay did not produce the  Presenting
      Officer's file note of the hearing, which might have clarified whether
      a concession was made. Although Ms Cross said  that  she  was  at  the
      hearing and asserted that a concession was made, it was  inappropriate
      for her to give evidence. She was not  the  legal  representative  who
      presented the case at the First-tier Tribunal  hearing.  There  is  no
      statement from Mr  Ashogbon,  who  was  recorded  as  the  appellant's
      representative. Mr Ashogbon's notes  of  the  hearing  have  not  been
      produced. No evidence is produced of the  nature  or  the  extent  the
      concession.

14.   The judge's note of the proceedings does not clarify whether a  formal
      concession was made. It merely states "10  years  met"  before  taking
      notes of the evidence.  I  have  considered  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      decision in detail.  It  is  also  unclear  as  to  whether  a  formal
      concession was  made,  and  if  so,  the  nature  and  extent  of  the
      concession. The judge summarised the reasons given by  the  respondent
      for removing the appellant  [4-11].  He  went  on  to  summarise  what
      happened at the hearing, including the evidence and  submissions  [17-
      52]. Although the judge mentions preliminary remarks at [18] there  is
      no mention of the Presenting Officer making a formal concession at the
      start of the hearing. When summarising the law the judge stated:

         "Significant in this appeal is whether the Appellant is entitled to
         have the benefit of the 10 year threshold .... If it is found  that
         the 10 year threshold applies then a relevant decision may  not  be
         taken" [55].

15.   The wording in paragraph 55 did not  suggest  that  a  concession  was
      made, but that the issue was to be determined. The only other area  of
      the decision that might indicate whether a concession was made is  the
      judge's summary of the submissions made by the Presenting Officer. The
      relevant part is as follows:

         "45. The Respondent relies upon the reasons for refusal letter.  As
         to the 10 year threshold, assuming that to be satisfied, the nature
         of the offences could justify removal. However it will be necessary
         for the respondent to establish that there were imperative  grounds
         of public security which justified the decision. The issue would be
         the threshold in that respect.


         46. Mr Briant raised issues relating to the  probation  report  and
         the  concerns  as  to  whether  the  Appellant  was  properly   and
         appropriately   engaged   in   that   respect   with   regard    to
         rehabilitation. There was also  reference  to  language  spoken  in
         Slovakia and reference to English. Mr  Briant  accepted  that  such
         aspects of the decision letter were incorrect.


         47. Mr Briant, in expressing concluding views in  relation  to  the
         EEA provisions Mr Briant acknowledged  that  the  Respondent  would
         have  'some  difficulties'  in  persuading  me  that  the  relevant
         threshold had been met. (sic)"

16.   Although there is  some  indication  from  the  judge's  note  of  the
      proceedings and the summary of the submissions  that  the  appellant's
      chronological period of residence was not disputed, the evidence falls
      short of recording a formal concession by the Presenting Officer  that
      the appellant engaged the requirement of  regulation  27(4)(a)  within
      the meaning ascribed to  it  in  the  relevant  case  law.  No  formal
      concession is recorded. The summary of Mr Briant's submission relating
      to  the  10-year  threshold,  "assuming  that  to  be  met",  is   not
      sufficiently clear to conclude that the  Presenting  Officer  conceded
      that regulation 27(4)(a) was engaged.

17.   Even if it was conceded that the appellant had lived in the UK  for  a
      chronological period of 10 years, the extent of the  concession  would
      need to be made clear in the First-tier Tribunal decision.  A  correct
      assessment would require the Presenting Officer to state  whether  the
      respondent conceded that integrative links had not been broken by  the
      appellant's sentence of imprisonment: see regulation 3(4). There is no
      evidence to show that such a concession was made.

18.   Had the judge made clear the nature and the extent of any  concession,
      and made clear that regulation 27(4)(a) was engaged because of a clear
      concession, I would have no hesitation in finding that the  judge  did
      not need to give detailed  reasons  for  the  bare  finding  at  [60].
      However, given the lack of clarity as to whether a  formal  concession
      was made, and the exact nature of any concession, it was incumbent  on
      the judge to explain how and  why  he  concluded  that  the  appellant
      satisfied the requirement of regulation 27(4)(a) and thereby benefited
      from  enhanced  protection  against  removal.  Having  considered  the
      decision as a whole, I find that there  is  a  lack  of  reasoning  to
      explain how and  why  the  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant  was
      entitled to the enhanced protection of regulation 27(4)(a).

19.   The Opinion of Advocate General Szpunar in  the  case  of  Vomero  was
      delivered on 24 October 2017 i.e. around a week before the  First-tier
      Tribunal hearing. Given the proximity of the opinion to the First-tier
      Tribunal hearing it is unsurprising that the parties, and  the  judge,
      might not have been aware of such a recent  development  in  the  law.
      Although an opinion of the Advocate General  is  not  binding,  it  is
      persuasive. The referral in the  case  of  Vomero  came  from  the  UK
      Supreme Court so the parties should have been aware of  the  referral.
      The opinion of Advocate General Szpunar indicates a different position
      to the provisional opinion held by the majority of the Supreme  Court.
      There is no evidence to show that the parties to the  appeal,  or  the
      judge, considered whether  the  appellant  had  acquired  a  right  of
      permanent residence as a prerequisite to assessing the 10-year  period
      for the purpose of  obtaining  enhanced  protection  under  regulation
      27(4)(a).

20.   For the reasons given above, I conclude that the  combination  of  the
      two points is sufficient to find that the First-tier Tribunal involved
      the making of an error of law.  The  judge  heard  evidence  from  the
      appellant and his sister and was clearly impressed by their  evidence.
      Those findings have not  been  challenged  and  shall  stand  [58-59].
      However, the decision must be set aside in so far as the assessment of
      regulation 27(4)(a), and any other relevant aspects of regulation  27,
      is concerned. The decision shall be remade at a resumed hearing.

DIRECTIONS

21.   The resumed hearing will be listed on the first available  date  after
    eight weeks.

The respondent

22.   The respondent did not appear to dispute that the appellant had  lived
    in the UK for a continuous chronological period of 10  years  prior  to
    the date of the removal decision. However,  the  extent  of  any  other
    concessions, if any, is unclear. The respondent shall  provide  written
    clarification of her position in relation  to  the  enhanced  level  of
    protection under regulation 27(4)(a) within 14 days of  the  date  this
    decision is sent.

The appellant

23.   The appellant will need to consider recent developments in the law  as
    set out above. Subject to further argument or concessions, it is likely
    that he will need  to  establish  that  (i)  he  acquired  a  right  of
    permanent residence before accruing a continuous period  of  10  years'
    residence; and (ii) his integrating links with the UK were  not  broken
    by his period of imprisonment.

24.   It is a matter for the appellant what evidence he wishes to adduce  in
    support of  the  appeal,  but  the  following  non-exhaustive  list  of
    evidence is likely to be of assistance to the Upper Tribunal.

      i) Any evidence to show that the appellant resided in accordance  with
         the EEA Regulations for a continuous period of five years,  and  in
         particular, from the date of his arrival in the UK.  The  appellant
         was likely to be dependent on his parents when he  arrived  in  the
         UK. The HMRC is likely to be able  to  provide  a  summary  of  his
         parents' contributions for the relevant period as evidence to  show
         that they were exercising rights of free movement.


     ii) Any evidence to show whether the period of imprisonment impacted on
         the connections that the appellant has in the UK  i.e.  whether  it
         broke integrating links.


    iii) The appellant will also need to consider whether any of the matters
         in  Schedule  1  of  The  Immigration  (European   Economic   Area)
         Regulations 2016 might  apply  to  his  case  and  adduce  evidence
         accordingly.

25.   Any further evidence relied upon by the  parties  shall  be  filed  at
    least seven days before the resumed hearing.
