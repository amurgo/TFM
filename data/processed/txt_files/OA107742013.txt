Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Slatter of Counsel instructed by Abbott
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This appeal comes before me today in order to re-make the  decision  in
    the appeal under Article 8 of the European Convention on  Human  Rights
    pursuant to a decision finding an error of law following the hearing at
    Field House on 9 September 2014.  The error of law decision is a matter
    of record and is appended  hereto,  should  be  read  as  part  of  the
    decision herein.  The background facts are set out  in  the  'error  of
    law' decision and I do not propose to re-rehearse them now.   I  do  no
    more than outline the salient features.


2.   The appeal is against the decision of  the  Respondent  dated  8  April
    2013 to refuse to grant entry clearance as a partner.  As  this  is  an
    entry clearance  decision  the  relevant  date  for  consideration  and
    assessment - even in respect  of  Article  8  -  is  the  date  of  the
    respondent's decision - see AS (Somalia) v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2009] UKHL 32.  This does not mean that  post-decision
    evidence is to be excluded insofar as it pertains  to  matters  at  the
    date of decision.


3.   The Appellant's partner, the sponsor, is Mrs Raqia Shah, date of  birth
    28 August 1991.  The Appellant and the sponsor were married in Pakistan
    on 29 August 2008.  The couple now have two children, the  first  being
    born on 18 April 2013 - so just after the Respondent's decision that is
    the subject of this appeal.


4.   I pause to note that  considerable  reference  has  been  made  to  the
    family circumstances with regard to the position of the  children,  the
    family life enjoyed between the children and the wider  family  in  the
    United Kingdom, and the relationship between  the  children  and  their
    father - the Appellant - who remains in Pakistan.  Such references were
    made both before the First-tier Tribunal and in the witness  statements
    that have been filed before the Upper Tribunal and signed today by each
    of the sponsor and her mother, Mrs Ghulam Sahaira Bano  Shah.   However
    Mr Slatter, presumably duly  instructed  notwithstanding  the  emphasis
    placed on the witness statements, invites me to disregard the  children
    altogether in considering Article 8 as neither had  been  born  at  the
    date of the Respondent's decision.  The only possible relevance is that
    the sponsor's pregnancy at the date  of  decision  and  the  subsequent
    births of two children  underscore  that  this  is  a  genuine  marital
    relationship.


5.   In this latter context Mr Whitwell accepts that a genuine  relationship
    exists, and it is not contested that family life existed at the date of
    the Respondent's decision as between the  Appellant  and  the  sponsor.
    Indeed it is not contested that the  Respondent's  decision  frustrated
    the wish for the couple to cohabit in the United  Kingdom.   In  effect
    there is no dispute that the first two Razgar questions may properly be
    answered in the Appellant's favour.  There  is  no  apparent  issue  in
    respect of the third and fourth Razgar questions and so ultimately  the
    focus  under  Article  8  is  on   the   fifth   Razgar   question   of
    proportionality.


6.   Mr Slatter's principal submission today is that  at  the  date  of  the
    Respondent's decision the sponsor  was  earning  at  a  gross  rate  of
    �21,444 which exceeded the requirement  under  the  Rules  of  �18,600.
    Whilst Mr Slatter does not seek to persuade me to allow the case  under
    the Rules he argues that I should have regard to the Rules as a context
    for considering Article 8.  In  effect,  if  the  Appellant  meets  the
    substantive financial requirements,  the  public  interest  should  not
    defeat his application because of evidential defects in the application
    for entry clearance.  To that extent Mr Slatter sought  to  explore  in
    examination-in-chief the sponsor's employment history and earnings.


7.   I heard evidence both from the sponsor and the sponsor's mother.   Each
    adopted their witness statements signed today at  the  Tribunal  -  the
    sponsor's mother's witness statement being adopted subsequent  to  some
    minor amendments at paragraph 16.  Little  further  was  asked  of  the
    sponsor's mother who did not give any specific evidence in relation  to
    the sponsor's income.  The sponsor was,  however,  asked  a  number  of
    questions both in  examination-in-chief  and  in  cross-examination  in
    respect of her history of employment and her earnings.  I have  made  a
    note of the evidence in the Record of Proceedings which is on file  and
    I have had regard to all that has  been  said  at  the  hearing  before
    reaching my decision.


8.   As  indicated  above  it  is  now  argued  that  at  the  date  of  the
    Respondent's decision the sponsor  was  earning  at  a  gross  rate  of
    �21,444 which exceeded the requirement under the Rules  in  respect  of
    sponsoring a partner.  This level of income is however under  the  rate
    if a child were to be included - which would be a rate of �22,400 - and
    so, of course, if I were to be taking into account the  imminent  birth
    of the first child shown post-decision to have been a  successful  live
    birth, Mr Slatter's principal submission would not be open to him.


9.   Although I emphasise that I am not and indeed am not being  invited  to
    determine the case under the Rules, I agree it is pertinent to consider
    them as a starting point.


10.  Mr Slatter acknowledges that the application for  entry  clearance  was
    deficient by reference to the evidential requirements of  Appendix  FM-
    SE.  Further, he also acknowledges that on the basis of  the  materials
    addressed  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision,  the  analysis   at
    paragraph 40 of that decision that found the funds insufficient to meet
    the �18,600 threshold  was  open  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.
    However, he states that additional materials are now available,  as  it
    were to 'fill the gaps', and in this  context  reliance  is  placed  in
    particular on the documents that appear at  pages  54  and  56  of  the
    Appellant's bundle filed before the Upper Tribunal.


11.  The document at page 54 is a letter  from  Shabab  Restaurant  dated  4
    February 2014 itemising the sponsor's pay in the period 1  August  2012
    to April 2013.  The document at page 56 (it is really a  document  over
    pages 55 and 56) is a bank statement for an account held by the sponsor
    which shows in particular a 'Faster Payment' credit on  8  August  2012
    from Shabab Restaurant in the sum of �1,426.16.


12.  The relevant Rules under Appendix FM-SE - which I again emphasise I  am
    not applying but to which I am nonetheless having regard -  require  at
    paragraph 2 that certain documents are  submitted  in  support  of  any
    claimed income.  In particular there is a requirement to  provide  wage
    slips, a  letter  from  the  employer,  and  personal  bank  statements
    corresponding to the same period as the wage slips.  The relevant Rules
    are a matter of record and I do not propose to set them out  in  detail
    here.


13.  As was explored at the hearing today there is a  disconnection  between
    the wage slips and the bank statements.  In particular the weekly  rate
    shown on the payslips does not equate with the monthly  rate  shown  in
    the bank statements.  So, for example  many  of  the  payslips  show  a
    weekly payment by cheque in the sum of �356.54 - which would equate  to
    a monthly income of �1,545; however the bank  statements  show  monthly
    payments of �1,426.16.   Necessarily  there  is  also  a  disconnection
    between the wage slips and the employer's letter because the employer's
    letter details payments at the same level as the bank statements.


14.  These were matters explored with the  sponsor  in  oral  evidence.   In
    this context I found the sponsor to be a vague and inconsistent witness
    in  respect  of  her  employment  and  earnings,  essentially  for  the
    following reasons, which formed part of Mr Whitwell's submissions.


15.  Over and above the disconnection between the  rates  of  pay  there  is
    also a disconnection in that the wage slips suggest weekly payment  and
    the bank statements suggest  monthly  payment.   Further  there  is  an
    inconsistency as to payment method, the wage slips  indicating  payment
    by  cheque  whereas  the  bank  statements  indicate  payment  by  bank
    transfer.  The sponsor, in my judgment, struggled to offer any adequate
    explanation for any of these discrepancies.  She suggested that she had
    asked for the method of payment to be altered from  weekly  cheques  to
    monthly payments into her bank account because she wished  to  be  paid
    more promptly and did not wish to await the clearing of any cheque that
    she might pay in.  As Mr Whitwell points out, this does not stand up to
    scrutiny.  Having to wait for payment at the end of the month  involves
    waiting longer for money than having pay received weekly and waiting  a
    few days for cheques to be cleared.  In any event this explanation does
    not explain why it continued to be the case that wage slips were issued
    showing payment on a weekly basis by  cheque.   The  sponsor  suggested
    that this was because this was the way other employees  were  paid  and
    that the same practice continued for her.  Without more I do not accept
    that explanation.  Further the supposed change  of  method  of  payment
    seemingly resulted in the sponsor receiving a monthly wage  lower  than
    that that she had previously received.  She stated  that  she  had  not
    questioned  this  with  her  employer,  who  is  also  her  uncle  (the
    restaurant being a family business).  I do not find  this  credible  or
    plausible.  In my judgment, had the sponsor suffered the loss of income
    suggested on the face of the documents, it is a matter that  she  would
    have raised with her uncle in order for some explanation, even  if  not
    remedy.


16.  Furthermore, I found the sponsor to be extremely  vague  in  describing
    her duties in the restaurant which she claims to  manage.  For  example
    when asked about her  role  in  respect  of  the  wages  of  the  other
    employees she simply said that it was her job to pass them  their  wage
    slips once those had  been  calculated  by  her  uncle;  she  otherwise
    described duties which were essentially those of a waitress.  While she
    subsequently added that she also had a role  in  ordering  in  food,  I
    formed the impression that she was making up her evidence as  she  went
    along in this regard.  In the circumstances I do not find her  credible
    in respect of the duties she undertakes in her place of work.


17.   The  evidential  requirements  of  the  Rules  are  there   to   allow
    appropriate scrutiny by a decision-maker.  In my judgment it  does  not
    behold the Appellant now effectively to bypass  those  requirements  by
    submitting materials that when considered alongside the oral  testimony
    of the sponsor lead to considerable doubts as  to  the  nature  of  the
    sponsor's employment and whether her rate of pay has been  artificially
    inflated.  The failure to meet the evidential  requirements  is  not  a
    mere procedural mishap that can readily be disregarded in an Article  8
    submission, but must be considered as something more  substantive  that
    does indeed sound - albeit not inevitably determinatively - in  Article
    8 as being an element of the system of immigration control (and thereby
    a part of the relevant 'public interest').


18.  Be that as it may, and in any event in all the  circumstances  of  this
    particular case, I do not accept that it has  been  demonstrated  on  a
    balance of probabilities that the sponsor was genuinely being  paid  as
    remuneration for employment at a rate in excess of the requirements  of
    the Rules at the date of the Respondent's decision.


19.  The primary factual premise for Mr Slatter's Article  8  submission  is
    thereby not made out.  What is left?


20.  I remind myself of the observations that I  made  in  the  decision  in
    respect of 'error of law', in particular at paragraph 15(iii) and  (iv)
    with regard to the necessity to identify circumstances not sufficiently
    recognised under the Rules in order to succeed on an  Article  8  claim
    outside the wording of the Rules; and that otherwise there was  a  risk
    of disregarding the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  for  no
    identifiable reason beyond the fact of the frustration of the  wish  to
    enjoy married or family life in the United Kingdom.  Given  that  I  am
    being invited to exclude the children from consideration, it  seems  to
    me that nothing of substance has been  advanced  to  indicate  why  the
    Appellant and the sponsor  should  have  an  exception  made  in  their
    particular  case.   Even  if  I  were  able,  or   invited,   to   give
    consideration to the circumstances  of  the  children  I  find  nothing
    remarkable in those circumstances.  Although reference has been made in
    the witness statements to the children suffering  from  ailments  those
    are matters that are said to be only of one week standing and there  is
    no supporting medical evidence in respect of either.


21.  Mr Slatter has made reference to what he described  as  'an  historical
    injustice point' by reason of the circumstance that the sponsor had not
    sponsored the Appellant as her partner at any earlier time because when
    they were married she  was  only  17  and  the  Rules  imposed  an  age
    restriction.  For that point to be made good it would be  necessary  to
    show that but for the way in which the Rules  were  then  drafted,  the
    Appellant would have been in a position to meet the requirements of the
    Rules, in particular in regard to the financial requirements.  No  such
    evidence has been put before me to suggest that that is so, and in  the
    circumstances I do not  consider  the  point  in  respect  of  what  is
    suggested to be an historical injustice is pertinent to  the  facts  of
    this particular case.


22.  For completeness I should note that no particular submission  has  been
    made by either representative in respect of Part 5A of the 2002 Act.  I
    have nonetheless had regard to the provisions  of  sections  117A-117D,
    but consider that they add or detract nothing  of  substance  from  the
    analysis set out above.


23.  In all of the circumstances I find that the Respondent's  decision  was
    entirely proportionate and that it did not breach the Article 8  rights
    of either the Appellant or the sponsor, or any other person.


24.  Further, I am unable to identify any other basis to conclude  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law.

Signed                                  Date: 25 January 2015

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge I A Lewis
                                  APPENDIX

                 TEXT OF 'ERROR OF LAW' DECISION AND REASONS



   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Jackson promulgated on 1 April 2014 allowing Mr Syed's appeal  against
      the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer ('ECO') dated 8 April 2013
      to refuse to grant entry clearance as a partner.


   2. Although  before  me  the  ECO  is  the  appellant  and  Mr  Syed  the
      respondent, for the sake of consistency with  the  proceedings  before
      the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter refer  to  Mr  Syed  as  the
      Appellant and the ECO as the Respondent.


Background

   3. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 5 March  1984.  On  29
      January 2013 he applied for entry clearance as the husband of Ms Raqia
      Fatima Shah ('the sponsor'). The application was refused  for  reasons
      set out in a Notice of Immigration Decision dated 8  April  2013  with
      particular reference to paragraphs S-EC.2.2(b), and E-ECP.2.6 and 2.10
      of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


   4. The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


   5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge rejected  the  Respondent's  case  under
      paragraph S-EC.2.2(b) (determination at paragraph 31), and found  that
      the Appellant met the requirements of paragraphs  E-ECP.2.6  and  2.10
      (paragraph 34).


   6. However, during the course of the hearing the Judge raised an issue in
      respect of the financial requirements of the  Rules,  with  particular
      reference to paragraph E-ECP.3.1(a)(i) and  the  required  documentary
      evidence under Appendix FM-SE. Having directed herself to the decision
      in Kwok on Tong, the  Judge  gave  directions  in  this  regard.  (See
      paragraph 35.) In the event there was no response to those  directions
      received by the Judge (paragraph 36). The Judge went on  to  determine
      the issues now raised under paragraph E-ECP.3.1(a)(i);  she  concluded
      that the Appellant had not provided  all  of  the  relevant  specified
      evidence pursuant to paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE (paragraph 39), and
      in any event concluded that it had not been shown that  the  sponsor's
      income met the substantive requirement  of  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1(a)(i)
      (paragraph 40). Thus the appeal  was  refused  under  the  Immigration
      Rules.


   7. However, the First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the Appellant's  appeal
      under Article 8 of the ECHR for the reasons set out at paragraphs  41-
      44 of the determination.


   8. The Respondent sought permission to appeal which was initially refused
      by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cheales on 20 May 2014, but  subsequently
      granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman on 22 July 2014.


   9. There has  been  no  application  for  permission  to  appeal  by  the
      Appellant  against  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  under   the
      Immigration Rules. Further, there has been no Rule 24  response  filed
      in respect of the Respondent's challenge to  the  decision  under  the
      ECHR.


Consideration: Error of Law

  10. In my judgement there is a lack of clarity in the First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge's reasoning in respect of proportionality such as to  amount  to
      an error of law requiring the decision to be set aside in this regard.


  11. Before addressing the  specific  reasoning  at  paragraph  44,  it  is
      convenient to make some preliminary observations  in  respect  of  the
      sponsor's income and the financial requirements under the  Rules,  and
      in respect of the Judge's consideration of the so-called 'intermediary
      test' disapproved of in MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ  985  (paragraphs
      128-129).


  12. In respect of the sponsor's income, I note the following:

(i) Under the Rules the required income figure was �18,600  (E-ECP.3.1(a)(i)
      - set out at paragraph 2  of  the  determination,  and  emphasised  at
      paragraph 38).

(ii) E-ECP.3.1(a)(ii) and (iii) impose  additional  income  requirements  of
      �3800 for the first child and �2400 for each further child. The  Judge
      made no reference to these additional requirements. In so far  as  the
      Judge was determining the appeal by reference to the circumstances  at
      the date of the Respondent's decision (8 April 2013) - as  indeed  she
      was required to do - such additional  requirements  were  not  engaged
      because the sponsor and the Appellant's first child had not  yet  been
      born.  The  Appellant's  first  child  was  born  on  18  April   2013
      (determination at paragraph 16).

(iii) However, notwithstanding that the requirement to determine the  appeal
      by reference to the circumstances at  the  date  of  the  Respondent's
      decision also applied to any consideration of the case by reference to
      the ECHR, the Judge plainly at paragraphs 41-44 gave  very  particular
      consideration - and attached significant weight to - the  presence  of
      the Appellant's British citizen son in the UK.

(iv) In this context by reference to the date of the  Respondent's  decision
      it could not be said in particular, as the Judge said at paragraph  42
      - "there is established family life  between  the  Appellant  and  the
      Sponsor and also between the Appellant and his child born on 18  April
      2013 in the United Kingdom. The  refusal  of  entry  clearance  as  an
      interference with that family life...".

(v) Even if it were the case that in the context of Article 8 the Judge  was
      entitled to consider that at the date of the Respondent's decision the
      birth of a child to the sponsor was imminent, and therefore  a  proper
      matter for consideration as a circumstance pertaining at the  date  of
      decision, in my judgement it would then have been  incumbent  to  have
      regard to the greater financial requirements imposed by  the  Rules  -
      even in the context of an Article 8 assessment.  I  find  that  it  is
      clear that the Judge had no regard to such a consideration.  (For  the
      avoidance of any doubt, when I state in this context 'have regard to',
      I do not mean 'impose as a requirement'. Rather, it is incumbent  upon
      a decision-maker to take into account the requirements of the Rules as
      a starting point when considering Article 8 beyond the letter  of  the
      Rules.)

(vi) The Judge did, nonetheless, set out with  some  considerable  care  and
      clarity  her  analysis  of  the  sponsor's  income  as  shown  by  the
      supporting  evidence:  see  paragraph  40.  The   alternative   totals
      calculated - �15,392 and �11,560 -  are  substantially  short  of  the
      requirements under the Rules, even allowing for a further  two  months
      salary to be added to the latter figure.


  13.  In  respect  of  the  'intermediary  test',  I  make  the   following
      observations.

(i) The Judge applied the 'intermediary test': see paragraph  41.  She  need
      not have done so. The  fact  that  she  did,  however,  is  immaterial
      because she did not adversely determine the appeal by  application  of
      this unnecessary step.

(ii) However, in considering the intermediary test the Judge had  regard  to
      matters that post-dated the Respondent's decision. Whilst it might  be
      said that it was appropriate to have regard to the imminent  birth  of
      the Appellant's first child, the expected birth of a further child  in
      August 2014 could not have been a relevant consideration at  the  date
      of decision, conception not having taken place until  late  2013  some
      seven or eight months after the Respondent's decision.

(iii) The Judge also had regard to MM [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) - "as to  the
      potential  for  the  maintenance   requirements   to   constitute   an
      unjustified and disproportionate  interference  with  the  ability  of
      spouses to live together". The decision in MM was  overturned  by  the
      Court of Appeal: see MM (Lebanon) (cited above).

(iv)  Although  the  intermediary  test  was  an   unnecessary   step,   the
      introduction by the Judge in considering such a test of the matters at
      (ii) and (iii) above was to introduce into her  overall  consideration
      irrelevant factors.


  14. Paragraph 44 of the determination is in the following terms:

"Although the Sponsor and her son have shown that they  are  able  to  visit
      the  Appellant  in  person  and  maintain  regular  contact  with  the
      Appellant through modern means  of  communication,  I  find  that  the
      refusal  of  entry  clearance  would  amount  to  a   disproportionate
      interference with the family life of the Appellant,  the  Sponsor  and
      their son. I have found that family life has  been  established,  that
      the best interests of the child are to be brought up by  both  parents
      in the same country and the Respondent has conceded  as  a  matter  of
      principle that it is not reasonable to expect British Citizen children
      to leave the United Kingdom. In those circumstances, it would  not  be
      proportionate to expect family life to continue in  Pakistan  (by  the
      Sponsor and her  son  relocating  there)  and  the  refusal  of  entry
      clearance would therefore  be  a  disproportionate  interference  with
      family life. It is not necessary in this case to  go  on  to  consider
      whether  the  maintenance  requirement  alone   would   constitute   a
      disproportionate interference with family life as suggested in  MM.  I
      allow  the  Appellant's  appeal  under  Article  8  of  the   European
      Convention on Human Rights."


  15. I find  that  paragraph  to  be  inadequately  reasoned.  I  note  the
      following:

(i) The first and last sentences do  no  more  than  to  state  the  Judge's
      conclusion. (This is an observation, not a criticism.)

(ii) The use of the word 'would' in "...I find that  the  refusal  of  entry
      clearance would amount  to  a  disproportionate  interference..."  and
      "...the  refusal   of   entry   clearance   would   therefore   be   a
      disproportionate interference...", appears further  to  indicate  that
      the Judge did not confine her consideration to  the  circumstances  at
      the date of the Respondent's decision, but was looking to a continuing
      refusal of entry clearance at the present time and thereby  evaluating
      the case by reference to the circumstances at the date of the hearing.
      (See also the observations at 12(iii) and  (iv),  and  13(ii)  above.)
      This was an error of law.

(iii) The substance of the paragraph - the  second  and  third  sentences  -
      adequately explains that the effect of the refusal of entry  clearance
      is to interfere with the family life of the Appellant, his  wife,  and
      child. In so doing the Judge does not identify any factor  present  in
      this case that is not an inherent aspect of a consideration under  the
      Rules. An application for a partner, or indeed a parent, to enter  the
      UK is premised on the UK partner or child being a British  citizen  or
      settled or  a  refugee  or  a  person  with  humanitarian  protection.
      Similarly,  any  such  application  is  necessarily  premised  on  the
      existence of family life, by virtue of  the  relationship.  The  Judge
      thereby  failed  to  identify  any   'compelling   circumstances   not
      sufficiently recognised under the Rules' - notwithstanding  her  self-
      direction to that effect at paragraph 5 of the determination.

(iv) In any event, whilst the Judge states her conclusion that it would  not
      be proportionate to expect family life  to  continue  in  Pakistan  by
      relocation of the sponsor and her son, this is really to  do  no  more
      than identify that the decision interferes with family life.  It  does
      not  in  itself  render  the  decision  to  refuse   entry   clearance
      disproportionate. The Judge's use of the word 'proportionate'  in  the
      second sentence is not explained, and in my  judgement  is  misplaced.
      Moreover, I find that the Judge does not offer any explanation  as  to
      what it is about the Respondent's decision - or more particularly  the
      Appellant's circumstances - that does render it disproportionate.  The
      effect of the Judge's decision is to disregard the requirements of the
      Immigration Rules for no identifiable reason beyond the  fact  of  the
      frustration of the wish to enjoy family life in the UK.  Without  more
      that does not constitute disproportionality.

(v) The Judge's reference to MM is confusing. In  stating  that  it  is  not
      necessary to consider whether  the  maintenance  requirements  "alone"
      would constitute a disproportionate interference with family life,  it
      is unclear as to whether or to what extent the  Judge  has  considered
      such matters cumulatively.

(vi) In any event, as identified above, I am not satisfied  that  the  Judge
      has had due regard to the financial requirements of  the  Rules  as  a
      starting point for a consideration of proportionality.  If  the  Judge
      did not have due regard to the Rules as a starting point  that  is  an
      error. If the Judge did have regard to the financial requirements,  it
      is unclear whether she did so by reference to the now overturned  High
      Court decision in MM. Or whether in doing so  in  circumstances  where
      she had regard to  the  situation  subsequent  to  the  birth  of  the
      Appellant's son, she  had  due  regard  to  the  additional  financial
      requirements imposed by  E-ECP.3.1(a)(ii).  The  lack  of  clarity  of
      reasoning in this regard is, in my judgement, an error of law.


  16. In all such circumstances I find that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      materially erred in her approach to the  appeal  under  Article  8.  I
      conclude that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in  that  regard
      must be set aside. The decision under the Rules is not the subject  of
      any cross-challenge and stands.


Remaking the Decision / Future Conduct of the Appeal

  17. Both representatives acknowledged that in the event  that  I  were  to
      find  an  error  of  law,  the  appeal  was   suitable   for   further
      consideration by the Upper Tribunal.


  18. Mr Graham indicated that if the decision were to require to be  remade
      he would wish to call both the sponsor and  the  sponsor's  mother  to
      give further evidence. No interpreter  is  required:  English  is  the
      first language of both. No particular directions were sought by either
      party: standard directions will suffice.


Notice of Decision

  19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  under  the  Immigration
      Rules is unchallenged and stands.


  20. Mr Syed's appeal remains dismissed under the Immigration Rules.


  21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge under the ECHR contained
      material errors of law and is set aside.


  22. The decision in the appeal on human rights grounds is  to  be  re-made
      before the Upper Tribunal.
