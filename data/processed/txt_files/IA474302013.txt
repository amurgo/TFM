                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Anonymity

 1. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and I will  refer  to  her  as  the  Claimant.   An
    application for anonymity was made by the Claimant and  I  granted  the
    application because part of this appeal concerns considering  the  best
    interests of the Claimant's minor daughter born 12th April 2013.   The
    Claimant is granted anonymity throughout these proceedings  unless  and
    until  directed  otherwise.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
    directly or indirectly identify  her  or  any  member  of  her  family.
    Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of  court.



Introduction and Background

 2. The Claimant is a female citizen of the United States of  America  born
    in July 1981.  On 15th July 2013 the Claimant applied for  a  residence
    card as confirmation of a right of residence in the United  Kingdom  as
    the spouse of a British citizen, in reliance upon regulation 9  of  The
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (the   2006
    Regulations).  The application  was  based  upon  the  claim  that  the
    Claimant's spouse had been residing and working in an EEA  state,  that
    being Hungary, as a worker, before returning to the United Kingdom.

 3. The application was refused on 7th  November  2013,  the  Secretary  of
    State not being satisfied that the Claimant and  her  spouse  had  been
    residing together in Hungary, nor that the Claimant's spouse  had  been
    working in Hungary, before returning to the United Kingdom.

 4. The appeal was heard on 21st February 2014 by Judge  Davies  who  found
    that the Claimant's spouse was a worker in Hungary and the Claimant and
    her spouse  had  lived  together  and  therefore  the  requirements  of
    regulation 9 of the 2006 Regulations were satisfied.   The  appeal  was
    allowed on that basis.  The judge therefore did not find  it  necessary
    to go on and consider either the Immigration Rules, or Article 8 of the
    1950 European Convention of Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 5. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal contending, in brief summary, that the judge  had  misdirected
    himself in law as to the definition of a worker and had failed to  take
    into account relevant case law.

 6. Full details of the application and the grant of permission are set out
    in my written decision dated 16th June 2014, which followed  a  hearing
    before me on 9th June 2014.  At that hearing I found that the judge had
    erred in his consideration of the 2006 Regulations,  and  full  reasons
    for this finding are set out in my written decision.  The  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal was set aside and the hearing adjourned so that
    the decision could be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.

Re-Making the Decision

Preliminary Issues

 7. Both the Claimant and her spouse attended the  hearing.   The  Claimant
    advised that she did  not  have  legal  representation  and  wished  to
    represent herself.  She told me that she did not intend to give or call
    any further evidence but would rely upon the  evidence  that  had  been
    given before the First-tier  Tribunal  and  that  she  wished  to  make
    representations as to why she should be allowed to remain in the United
    Kingdom based upon Article 8 of the 1950 Convention.

 8. The  Claimant  did  not  appreciate  that  regulation  9  of  the  2006
    Regulations still fell to be considered, as she mistakenly thought that
    had been dismissed at the earlier hearing.  I explained  that  I would
    look at all issues of the appeal again.

 9. I ascertained that I had received  all  documentation  upon  which  the
    parties intended to rely.  I had  the  Respondent's  bundle  containing
    Annexes A-E, and the Claimant had consolidated all documents  that  had
    been prepared on her behalf in a bundle comprising 160 pages which  was
    presented to myself and Miss Johnson.

10. Both the Claimant and Miss Johnson indicated that they  were  ready  to
    proceed and there was no application for an adjournment.

The Claimant's Submissions

11. In relation to the 2006 Regulations, the Claimant stated that  she  had
    nothing to add to what was contained in the documentary evidence, which
    had been placed before the First-tier Tribunal.

12. In relation to Article 8 the Claimant submitted case  law,  MA  and  SM
    Iran [2013] UKUT 00380 (IAC) and Izuazu [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC).

13. The Claimant confirmed that she had  established  both  a  private  and
    family life since arriving in the United Kingdom.  She had married  her
    spouse on 18th September 2011 in the United States.  She had not wished
    to remain in the United States because of difficulties she  experienced
    with her family, and she and her spouse travelled to  Hungary  on  22nd
    August 2012.  It was intended that her spouse would teach English.

14. The couple were let down by an agent, and  employment  which  they  had
    initially anticipated in the Czech Republic  did  not  materialise  but
    there was employment  in  Hungary.   Although  free  accommodation  was
    provided, the Hungarian authorities would not issue a residence permit,
    and because of numerous difficulties which were not the fault of either
    the Claimant or her spouse, including the fact that her spouse was  not
    paid his salary, they left Hungary on 11th September 2012 and travelled
    to the United Kingdom.

15. They have a daughter born in the United Kingdom  on  12th  April  2013.
    Both the Claimant's spouse and her daughter are British citizens.

16. The Claimant referred to Appendix A, of Izuazu and  in  particular  the
    response to question (ii) which asks whether it is reasonable to expect
    a British citizen who has genuine family life in the United Kingdom  to
    relocate permanently abroad if a family member has to leave the  United
    Kingdom.  The Claimant contended that it was conceded by the  Secretary
    of State that it would not be reasonable for a British citizen to  have
    to leave the United Kingdom.  She stated that if she had to  leave  the
    United Kingdom, her daughter would also have to leave with her, as  she
    is the primary carer and is still breast feeding.  Her spouse would not
    be able to adequately look after her daughter in her absence.

17. In relation to her mental health issues, which relate to severe anxiety
    the Claimant pointed out that page 106 of her bundle contained  a  note
    from a clinical psychologist which referred to her suffering from acute
    distress syndrome.  The Claimant had not needed  to  seek  any  medical
    attention since she had been in the United Kingdom.

18. I was asked to take into account both the Claimant's witness  statement
    and that of her spouse, and to note that he  has  been  a  longstanding
    member of the community in Manchester and  to  take  into  account  the
    family and other ties that he has in the  northwest  of  England.   The
    Claimant's spouse had lived with her in the United  States  where  they
    married, but had surrendered his green card when they left  the  United
    States, and therefore he may not be able to return.

19. The Claimant used to be a lawyer in the United States, and wishes to be
    able to work in the United Kingdom but has not worked illegally.

20. When I asked the Claimant whether an  application  had  been  made  for
    leave to remain  under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  she
    confirmed that it had not, because she thought she would be entitled to
    remain under the 2006 Regulations.

The Submissions of the Secretary of State

21. Miss Johnson relied upon the  reasons  for  refusal  letter  dated  7th
    November 2013.  By way of case law she relied upon Begum (EEA - worker -
     jobseeker) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 00275 (IAC)  and  O  v  Minister  voor
    Immigratie, Integratie en Asiel, Case C-456/12.  I was  asked  to  find
    that the Claimant and her spouse had only resided  in  Hungary  between
    22nd August 2012 and 11th September 2012, and it was accepted that  the
    Claimant's spouse had not been paid for any work  undertaken,  and  the
    case law confirmed that the Claimant did not satisfy  regulation  9  of
    the 2006 Regulations.

22. Miss Johnson submitted that the Claimant could have made an  Article  8
    claim pursuant to Appendix FM  but  had  not  done  so.   Miss  Johnson
    accepted that the Claimant was entitled to rely upon  EX.1.(a)  as  she
    has a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a  British
    child.  Miss Johnson's position was that it would not be reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom because she is  a  British
    citizen, but it would be reasonable  for  the  Claimant  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom and return to  the  United  States  and  make  an  entry
    clearance application from abroad.   The  child  could  stay  with  her
    father.

23. Therefore the Article 8 family life  claim  should  be  dismissed  with
    reference to EX.1. of Appendix FM,  and  Miss  Johnson  submitted  that
    there were no arguable  grounds  to  consider  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  However if Article 8  was  considered  outside  the
    rules, I should take into account the factors referred  to  in  section
    117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act)
    and conclude that it would be proportionate for the Claimant  to  leave
    the United Kingdom and apply for entry clearance from abroad.

The Claimant's Response

24. Prior to hearing the Claimant's response I explained to her  the  legal
    issues involved in relation to Appendix FM, and Article 8 of  the  1950
    Convention.  The Claimant explained that if she had to leave the United
    Kingdom she would have to take her daughter with her.

25. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

26. The burden of proof  is  on  the  Claimant  in  relation  to  the  2006
    Regulations and the Immigration Rules.  The  standard  of  proof  is  a
    balance of probability.  As this is not an entry clearance case,  I  am
    not restricted to considering circumstances appertaining at the date of
    decision, and can consider evidence as at the date of hearing.

27. I have taken into account all the documentation placed before me,  even
    if I do not specifically refer to that documentation.  Included  within
    the documentation are  statements  made  by  witnesses  supporting  the
    Claimant, and I have taken those into account.

28. I deal firstly with the application for a residence  card  pursuant  to
    regulation 9 of the 2006 Regulations.  I set out below regulation 9  as
    it was at the date of  decision,  although  it  has  been  subsequently
    amended;

    9.   (1) If the  conditions  in  paragraph  (2)  are  satisfied,  these
             Regulations apply to a person who is the family  member  of  a
             United Kingdom national as if the United Kingdom national were
             an EEA national.
         (2)  The conditions are that -
             (a)  the United Kingdom national is residing in an  EEA  state
                  as a worker or self-employed person  or  was  so  residing
                  before returning to the United Kingdom; and
             (b)  if the family member of the United  Kingdom  national  is
                  his spouse  or  civil  partner,  the  parties  are  living
                  together in the EEA state or had entered into the marriage
                  or civil partnership and  were  living  together  in  that
                  state before the United Kingdom national returned  to  the
                  United Kingdom.
         (3)  Where these Regulations apply to the family member of a United
             Kingdom national the United Kingdom national should be treated
             as holding a valid passport issued by an  EEA  state  for  the
             purpose of the application of regulation  13  to  that  family
             member.

29. I do not find that the Claimant has discharged the burden of proof.   I
    accept that she and her spouse married on 18th September 2011, and that
    they travelled together from the  United  States  to  Hungary  on  22nd
    August 2012.  They initially expected to find employment in  the  Czech
    Republic, but that employment did not materialise and arrangements were
    made for the Claimant's spouse to work in two schools in Hungary.

30. I accept the Claimant's evidence in her  witness  statement,  paragraph
    20, that having arrived in Budapest she was shocked to  hear  that  the
    Czech Republic job was not available, and thereafter for five days  she
    and her spouse "were messed about as to where in Hungary  we  would  be
    working."

31. I accept that the Claimant's spouse commenced  some  training  and  the
    Claimant's evidence at paragraph 27 of her witness statement  that  her
    spouse was due to start teaching  students  on  September  3rd  at  two
    schools.  I accept that the couple were  let  down  by  those  who  had
    promised the employment and although they had accommodation  for  which
    they did not have to pay, the Claimant's spouse  did  not  receive  any
    salary.  I also accept that the Hungarian authorities refused to  issue
    residence documentation.  The couple left  Hungary  on  11th  September
    2012.   Therefore  the  Claimant's  spouse   had   been   working   for
    approximately eight days.

32. The Upper Tribunal in Begum considered Court of Appeal  case  law,  and
    jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union and set out
    in paragraph 6 the features identified by the Court  of  Appeal  for  a
    Union citizen to be regarded as a worker and these are set out below;

    (a)  The terms 'worker' and 'activity as an  employed  person'  have  a
         Community meaning and may  not  be  defined  by  reference  to  the
         national laws of the Member States (see para 11 of Levin, cited  in
         para 18 of the judgment).
    (b)  Since it defines the scope of freedom of movement,  the  Community
         concept of a 'worker' must be interpreted broadly (see para  16  of
         Lawrie-Blum, cited in para 39 of the judgment).
    (c)  The right of residence as a worker is not subject to any condition
         relating to the type of employment  or  to  the  amount  of  income
         derived from it (see para 14 of Levin, cited  in  para  18  of  the
         judgment).
    (d)  A worker is a person who pursues effective and genuine activities,
         to the exclusion of activities on such  a  small  scale  as  to  be
         regarded as purely marginal and ancillary (see para  17  of  Levin,
         cited in paragraph 18 of the judgment).
    (e)  The concept  of  'worker'  must  be  defined  in  accordance  with
         objective criteria which distinguish the employment relationship by
         reference to the rights and duties of the persons  concerned.   The
         essential feature of an  employment  relationship  is  that  for  a
         period of time  a  person  performs  services  for  and  under  the
         direction of  another  person  in  return  for  which  he  receives
         remuneration (see para 17 of Lawrie-Blum, cited in para 39  of  the
         judgment).
    (f)  Such activities must have economic value to the employer (see para
         19 of Lawrie-Blum, cited in para 39 of the judgment).

33. This issue was considered in the Court of Justice of the European Union
    in O who in summary indicated that when considering whether the non-EEA
    family member of an EEA national  is  entitled  to  a  residence  card,
    following the EEA national working in another member  state  this  will
    only arise where the residence of the EEA national in the  host  member
    state has been sufficiently genuine so as to  enable  that  citizen  to
    create or strengthen family life in that member state.  This will apply
    once Article 7 of Directive 2004/38 is engaged, which means  after  the
    initial right of three months' residence has expired.

34. I set out below paragraph 51 of O, and paragraph 54 in part, which were
    both referred to in the Secretary of State's application for permission
    to appeal;

    51.  An obstacle such as that referred to in paragraph  47  above  will
         arise only where the residence of the union  citizen  in  the  host
         Member State has been sufficiently genuine so  as  to  enable  that
         citizen to create or strengthen family life in that  member  state.
         Article 21(1) TFEU does not therefore require that every  residence
         in the host member state by a union citizen accompanied by a family
         member who is  a  third  country  national  necessarily  confers  a
         derived right of residence on that  family  member  in  the  member
         state of which that citizen is a national upon the citizen's return
         to that member state.
    54.  Where, during the genuine residence of the union  citizen  in  the
         host  member  state,  pursuant  to  and  in  conformity  with   the
         conditions set out in Article 7(1) and (2)  of  Directive  2004/38,
         family life is created or strengthened in that  member  state,  the
         effectiveness of the rights  conferred  on  the  union  citizen  by
         Article 21(1) TFEU requires that the citizen's family life  in  the
         host member state may continue on returning to the member of  state
         of which he is a national, through the grant of a derived right  of
         residence to the family member who is a third country national.

    Applying the principles outlined in the case law, I am  satisfied  that
    the Claimant and her spouse lived together in Hungary,  but  I  do  not
    find that it has been proved that the Claimant's spouse  satisfies  the
    definition of a worker such that the Claimant would be  entitled  to  a
    residence card pursuant to regulation 9 of the 2006  Regulations.   The
    Claimant's spouse did  not  receive  any  remuneration,  and  only  had
    employment for approximately eight days, and it could not be said  that
    the period of time spent in  Hungary  created  or  strengthened  family
    life.  Therefore the appeal under the 2006 Regulations fails.

35. I next consider Article 8 of the 1950 Convention, which was raised as a
    ground of appeal before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I  therefore  must
    consider Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules which relates  to  family
    life, and paragraph 276ADE, which relates to private life.

36. It was not contended that the Claimant could satisfy  paragraph  276ADE
    and it is clear from the evidence that she cannot.  This is because she
    has not resided in the United Kingdom for at least twenty years, as she
    has only been resident since 11th September 2012, and it  is  not  the
    case that she has no ties to the United States of America.

37. Appendix FM sets out the requirements for leave to  remain  both  as  a
    parent and as a partner.

38. Section R-LTRP sets out the requirements for limited leave to remain as
    a partner which are as follows;

    R-LTRP.1.1    The requirements to be met for limited leave to remain as
                a partner are -
                (a)    the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;
                (b)    the applicant must have made a valid application  for
                    limited or indefinite leave to remain as a partner;  and
                    either
                (c)    (i)  the applicant must not fall  for  refusal  under
                        section S-LTR;
                        suitability leave to remain; and
                    (ii)   the applicant meets all of  the  requirements  of
                        section E-LTRP: Eligibility for leave to remain  as
                        a partner; or
                (d)    (i)  the applicant must not fall  for  refusal  under
                        section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
                    (ii)    the  applicant   meets   the   requirements   of
                        paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2-1.12 and E-LTRP.2.1;
                    (iii)  paragraph EX.1 applies.

39. The requirements for limited leave to remain as a parent are set out in
    section R-LTRPT;

    R-LTRPT.1.1   The requirements to be met for limited leave to remain as
                a parent are -
                (a)    the applicant and the child must be in the UK;
                (b)    the applicant must have made a valid application  for
                    limited or indefinite leave to remain as  a  parent;  or
                    partner and either
                (c)    (i)  the applicant must not fall  for  refusal  under
                        section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
                    (ii)   the applicant meets all of  the  requirements  of
                        section E-LTRPT: Eligibility for leave to remain as
                        a parent or
                (d)    (i)  the applicant must not fall  for  refusal  under
                        section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
                    (ii)    the  applicant   meets   the   requirements   of
                        paragraphs E-LTRPT.2.2-2.4 and E-LTRPT.3.1;
                    (iii)  paragraph EX.1 applies.

40. The requirement that an applicant must have made  a  valid  application
    for limited or indefinite leave to remain  as  either  a  parent  or  a
    partner does not apply by virtue of GEN.1.9(iv) because Article  8  has
    been raised in an appeal.

41. I conclude that the Claimant cannot satisfy the financial  requirements
    in E-LTRP.3.1 because to satisfy those requirements, specified evidence
    must be provided to the Secretary of State proving there is available a
    specified gross annual income of at least �18,600.   The  Claimant  has
    not made an application to the Secretary of  State,  and  no  financial
    evidence in relation to her spouse's employment has been  submitted  to
    the Tribunal.

42. The Claimant satisfies the suitability requirements set out in Appendix
    FM and the English language requirements.  The Claimant also  satisfies
    the relationship requirements.

43. In relation to the immigration status requirements the Claimant is  not
    in the United Kingdom as a visitor, nor is she here  with  valid  leave
    granted for a period of six months or less, and  I  therefore  conclude
    that she is entitled to rely  upon  section  EX,  which  sets  out  the
    exceptions to certain eligibility requirements for leave to remain as a
    partner or parent.  Miss Johnson  accepted  at  the  hearing  that  the
    Appellant was entitled to rely  upon  EX.1.,  although  Miss  Johnson's
    contention was that the appeal should not succeed because of that.

44. I set out below EX.1.;

    EX.1.    This paragraph applies if
           (a)    (i)  the applicant has a genuine and subsisting  parental
                    relationship with a child who -
                    (aa)   is under the age of 18 years; or  was  under  the
                        age of  18  years  when  the  applicant  was  first
                        granted leave on  the  basis  that  this  paragraph
                        applied
                    (bb)   is in the UK;
                    (cc)   is a British citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                        continuously for at least the 7  years  immediately
                        preceding the date of application; and
                (ii)   it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                    leave the UK; or
           (b)    the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
                with a partner who is in the UK and is  a  British  citizen,
                settled in the UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
                humanitarian  protection,  and  there   are   insurmountable
                obstacles  to  family  life  with  that  partner  continuing
                outside the UK.
    EX.2.     For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX1.1.(b)  "insurmountable
           obstacles" means the very significant difficulties  which  would
           be faced by the applicant or their partner in  continuing  their
           family life together outside the  UK  and  which  could  not  be
           overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the applicant
           or their partner.

45. The Claimant has a British child who is in the United Kingdom.   It  is
    not  disputed  that  she  has  a  genuine   and   subsisting   parental
    relationship with that  child.   The  issue  is  whether  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.

46. This involves considering the best interests of the child.  The Supreme
    Court in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 stated that best  interests  of  a
    child broadly means the well-being of the child, and a consideration of
    where those best interests  lie  will  involve  asking  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect the child to live in another country.  Nationality
    is not a "trump card" but in paragraph 30, it was stated that it is  of
    particular importance in assessing the best  interests  of  any  child.
    When considering proportionality the best interests of the  child  must
    be a primary consideration, and it is accepted that the best  interests
    of a child  can  be  outweighed  by  the  cumulative  effect  of  other
    considerations.

47. The Upper Tribunal in Azimi-Moayed [2013] UKUT  00197  (IAC)  confirmed
    that as a starting point it is in the best interests of children to  be
    with both their parents.  If both parents are  to  be  removed  from  a
    country, it would generally be  in  the  best  interests  of  dependent
    children to be removed with them,  unless  there  are  reasons  to  the
    contrary.

48. It is generally in the interests of children to have both stability and
    continuity of social and  educational  provision  and  the  benefit  of
    growing up in the cultural norms of the society to which they belong.

49. I take into account that the Claimant's daughter is very young, and  it
    could be argued that she could, because of her young age, easily  adapt
    to life in the United States if she had to leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    However, that argument does not attach weight  to  the  fact  that  the
    Claimant's daughter was born in this country and is a British  citizen,
    and therefore is entitled to live in this country.

50. So far as her best interests are concerned, it is clear that those  lie
    in being brought up by both parents in  a  stable  home.   The  present
    situation is that the child's father is in employment and  it  is  said
    that he earns in excess of the required amount  of  �18,600  per  year,
    although no financial evidence was submitted.  I do accept that he  has
    employment with the Cooperative, and  that  he  also  has  a  small  IT
    business.  The Claimant is not working and she does not have permission
    to work although she was a qualified lawyer in the United States.

51. If the Claimant had to leave the United Kingdom, it is my view that  in
    practical terms, her daughter would have to leave with her.   I  accept
    the Claimant is the primary carer and I accept the Claimant's  evidence
    that she is still breast feeding.  If the family left as a unit,  there
    is no guarantee that the Claimant's spouse would  be  admitted  to  the
    United States, although I accept that he previously resided  there  and
    held a green card but that has now been surrendered.

52. I accept that although financial evidence has not  been  produced,  the
    family have an adequate income, and adequate accommodation.   I  accept
    their evidence that they have a joint tenancy.  There  is  no  evidence
    that there has been any  claim  by  the  Claimant  or  her  spouse  for
    benefit.

53. The best interests of the child are to remain with both her parents  in
    the United Kingdom, where  she  has  emotional  support,  and  adequate
    maintenance and accommodation.

54. Therefore I conclude that on the facts of this case, it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the Claimant's child to leave the United  Kingdom,
    and return to the United States,  where  the  Claimant  would  have  no
    immediate prospect of employment, and  I accept  would  not  seek  the
    support of her family  there.   There  has  been  no  detailed  medical
    evidence as to the Claimant's mental health difficulty.  There has been
    a note written  by  a  clinical  psychologist  dated  17th  July  2012,
    requesting that the Claimant have leave of absence from her  employment
    for one month as a result of suffering from an acute distress syndrome.
     I accept the Claimant's evidence that contact with  her  family  makes
    her condition worse,  and  she  therefore  would  not  seek  to  obtain
    assistance from them if she had to return to the United States.

55. In my view it would not be reasonable for the  Claimant  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom and leave her daughter in this country  for  an  unknown
    period of time while an application for entry  clearance  is  made.   I
    therefore conclude this appeal succeeds with reference to EX.1.(a).

56. In relation to EX.1.(b) I accept that the Claimant has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with her spouse who is in  the  United  Kingdom
    and is a British citizen.  There is however  a  different  test  to  be
    considered in this case, the test is not whether it would be reasonable
    for the couple  to  continue  their  family  life  outside  the  United
    Kingdom.  They have to prove  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    difficulties which could not be overcome, or would entail very  serious
    hardship for one or both of them.  I do not allow the  appeal  on  this
    basis.  Although there would be serious difficulties if the family  had
    to relocate to the United States, evidence  submitted  does  not  prove
    that these difficulties could not eventually be overcome.

57. As I allow the appeal under EX.1.(a) of Appendix FM,  I  conclude  that
    there is no need to consider Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules.
    If Article 8 was considered outside the rules, I  would  conclude  that
    family and private life exists, and following  the  five  stage  Razgar
    [2004]  UKHL  27  approach,  the  issue  would  be   whether   proposed
    interference  with  the  Claimant's  family  and   private   life   was
    proportionate.  This would involve considering the best interests of  a
    child, as I have done under the Immigration Rules, and would involve  a
    proportionality test which would involve considering a similar test  to
    that set out in EX.1., whether it would be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    child to leave the United Kingdom, and in addition whether it would  be
    reasonable to expect the Claimant's spouse to leave the United Kingdom.



58. If I had proceeded to carry out that test, I would find  in  favour  of
    the Claimant.  The present situation is that the Claimant's spouse  has
    employment and can financially support  the  family,  the  family  have
    adequate accommodation, and have not needed to  rely  on  benefits.   I
    would therefore have allowed the appeal under  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.  I substitute a fresh decision.

The Claimant's appeal pursuant to The Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
Regulations 2006 is dismissed.

The Claimant's appeal is allowed with reference to section EX.1.(a).

Anonymity

I remind the parties that an anonymity order has been made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the appeal has been allowed I have  considered  whether  to  make  a  fee
award.  The appeal has been allowed because of the  Claimant's  family  life
with her child.  That was not the  application  made  to  the  Secretary  of
State.  The application was for a residence card  and  the  appeal  on  that
issue has been dismissed.  There is no fee award.
