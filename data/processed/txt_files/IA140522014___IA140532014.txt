                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellants born on 12th February 1971 and 29th August 1971 are both
    citizens of Malaysia and are husband  and  wife.   The  Appellants  are
    represented by Mr Gilbert of Counsel.  The Respondent  was  represented
    by Mr Tarlow a Presenting Officer.





Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellants had made application for leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom and this had been refused by the  Respondent.   The  Appellants
    had appealed that decision and their appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Andrew sitting at Birmingham on 9th October  2014.   The
    judge dismissed their appeals under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Appellants made application for  permission  to  appeal  which  was
    initially refused but permission was granted by the Upper Tribunal.  It
    was said that it was  arguable  that  the  judge  had  not  necessarily
    considered all of the evidence to show the nature of the business trips
    made by the first Appellant and that it was arguable that the Article 8
    decision was dependent upon the outcome of the  application  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Directions were issued directing the Upper Tribunal
    firstly to decide whether an error of law had been made in this case or
    not.  The matter comes before me in accordance with those directions.

Submissions on Behalf of the Appellants

 4. It was submitted that the judge had failed to look at Article 8 in this
    case particularly in circumstances where the Immigration Rules  were  a
    strict code and it was submitted there were compelling or good  reasons
    to consider the matter outside of the Rules and I was referred  to  the
    case of SS Congo.

Submissions on Behalf of the Respondent

 5. Mr Tarlow accepted, in my view fairly and properly, that there had been
    a  failure  on  the  part  of  the  judge  to  consider  Article  8  in
    circumstances where it did need to be examined outside of the Rules and
    he accepted that a material  error  of  law  had  been  made  in  those
    circumstances.

 6. It was further agreed between the  representatives  that  in  terms  of
    remaking a decision I  had  before  me  all  the  documents  that  were
    necessary and that there was no requirement for any further evidence to
    be considered  and  therefore  the  matter  could  proceed  by  way  of
    submissions only.  I  agreed  and  heard  those  submissions  and  have
    provided my decision below.

Decision

 7. I find that a material error of law was made by the judge in this  case
    and set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  and  now  remake
    that decision having considered all the documentary evidence  available
    and submissions raised by both parties.

Decision and Reasons

 8. The first Appellant had made  application  on  5th  February  2014  for
    indefinite leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  2  (General)  Migrant.
    The second Appellant was a dependent upon that  claim.   The  case  had
    been considered under paragraph 245HF of the Immigration  Rules.   This
    allowed the first Appellant to succeed if he  had  spent  a  continuous
    period of five years in the UK in any combination set out at  paragraph
    245HF(c).  However paragraph 245AAA(a) defined "continuous  period"  to
    mean that a period of 180 days or less spent outside the UK in any  one
    of the preceding five years would not break the concept  of  continuous
    period.  The Respondent found that  in  the  period  February  2010  to
    February 2011 the first Appellant on his own admission  had  spent  214
    days outside of the UK albeit on business related activities.   It  was
    for that single reason the Respondent had refused the  application  and
    the refusal had been upheld by the First-tier Tribunal.

 9. Further the Respondent at page 2 of the refusal letter appears to  have
    looked outside of the Rules but found  the  statement  from  the  first
    Appellant's employer that he was on business purposes not  sufficiently
    compelling to waive the requirement.

10. There was some discussion  at  the  error  of  law  stage  as  to  what
    documents the First-tier Tribunal Judge had seen.  The employer  letter
    referred to by the Respondent in the refusal letter was a letter  dated
    29th January 2014.  That merely listed the dates in 2010 to  2011  when
    the first Appellant had been to Saudi Arabia for  "business  purposes".
    There was however a later letter dated 11th  September  2014  from  the
    employer which provided rather more detail  as  to  the  valuable  work
    being done by the first Appellant on business in Saudi Arabia  and  the
    contribution to the UK from his involvement.   That  letter  could  not
    have been seen by the Respondent as it postdates their refusal  letter.
    It was in my view seen by the judge (see paragraph 2 decision) although
    unfortunately he did not specifically refer or deal with  that  letter.
    It is possible, had the Respondent  seen  that  letter  that  may  have
    changed his view on discretion although I accept that is speculative.

11. I have looked at the Home Office policy  guidelines  in  terms  of  ILR
    calculating continuous periods.  This appears at pages 88 to 118 of the
    Appellants' bundle.  It is not sadly  the  clearest  written  document.
    However, save and except for compassionate reasons it does appear  that
    the period of 180 days in any twelve month period over  the  past  five
    years, calculating a twelve  month  period  from  date  of  application
    backwards, is the ceiling.  Accordingly in one of those five years  the
    Appellant had 214 days although that was almost wholly  connected  with
    his job based in the UK.  It is enough however to  mean  the  Appellant
    did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

12. Given that those Rules are essentially black and white  and  given  the
    Respondent  herself  looked  at  the  matter   discretionally   it   is
    appropriate to consider  whether  the  Appellants'  case  needs  to  be
    examined outside of the Rules.   In  this  regard  whilst  there  is  a
    plethora of case law I have taken as a useful and recent guide the case
    of SS Congo [2015], which in turn refers back to other  relevant  cases
    including  Nagre.   The  test,  where  a  person  is  not  subject   to
    deportation or unlawfully/precariously in the UK is whether  there  are
    compelling reasons to look outside of the  Rules.   I  find  there  are
    compelling reasons in this case for two specific reasons.

13. However I make it clear at the outset that I accept that Article  8  of
    the ECHR cannot be used simply in a "near miss case".  That is not  its
    function.

14. The first reason is as follows.  There  are  many  cases  where  it  is
    necessary to have looked at  all  of  the  first  Appellant's  relevant
    personal circumstances to decide  in  the  first  instance  whether  an
    Appellant falls within or without of the Immigration Rules.  If he does
    not fall within the Rules then an examination separately under  Article
    8 of the ECHR is in many respects simply rehashing the same  debate  on
    the same set of facts  which  have  already  been  examined.   Such  an
    exercise in my view is far less likely to  provide  compelling  reasons
    for deciding the case needs to be examined outside of the Rules.   That
    however is not the situation before me.  Essentially the only  relevant
    factor in the first Appellant's circumstances that was, or needed to be
    examined for the purposes of these Immigration Rules,  was  whether  he
    had or had not spent more than 180 days outside of the UK in any twelve
    months of the previous five year period.  Nothing else about the  first
    Appellant's case was in reality considered.  In those circumstances  it
    becomes somewhat more compelling to go to a second  stage  (outside  of
    Rules) to enable all the first Appellant's relevant circumstances to be
    considered essentially for the first time.

15. Secondly there are in  this  case  several  reasons  why  the  specific
    circumstances compel a proper review of his case.   Indeed  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph 13 of his decision had raised some  of
    those factors.  Broadly the following points can be noted:

         "(1) The fact that it was only in one of the  five  years  and  the
             earliest in time that the Appellant went over the 180 days.

         (2)  That excess period was wholly as a result of a specific job he
             was undertaking for his employers in the UK, work for which he
             was granted a visa.

         (3)  That work was providing a  valuable  contribution  to  the  UK
             economy."

16. For all  of  the  above  reasons  I  find  compelling  reasons  for  an
    examination of  the  first  Appellant's  (and  dependent  wife's)  case
    outside of the Rules.  In any such examination outside of the Rules the
    test is one of proportionality as set out in the  five  stage  test  in
    Razgar.  I find the first four stages met  in  Razgar  and  accordingly
    move to that examination of proportionality at  the  final  stage.   In
    assessing proportionality the  starting  point  is  to  have  full  and
    careful regard to Section 117B of the 2002 Act  set  out  in  statutory
    form, the public interest.  The public interest in  such  cases  is  of
    great importance when conducting a proportionality  exercise,  and  its
    rendition in statue is a reminder of such.  Further all aspects need to
    be considered (Dube [2015]).

17. Section 117B(i) reminds one that immigration control is in  the  public
    interest.  Section 117B(ii) refers to the ability to speak English  for
    good reasons that are further set out in (ii)(a) and  (b).   The  first
    Appellant and his wife speak good English.  They have integrated within
    society  and  are  not  a  burden.   Indeed  they  are   valuable   net
    contributors.  Section 117B(iii) refers to financial independence.   It
    is clear that in  this  case  both  the  Appellants  work.   The  first
    Appellant works for Aecom and the second Appellant works as a  property
    consultant with CBRE Ltd.  Further both Appellants  have  been  working
    continuously for the seven years  that  they  have  lived  in  the  UK.
    Section 117B(iv) and (v) rightly refer to little weight being given  to
    private life if developed when in the UK  unlawfully  or  precariously.
    That sentiment  is  echoed  in  SS  Congo  where  the  requirement  for
    consideration of such a person under Article 8, is  exceptional  rather
    than the test of compelling in other circumstances.  In this case  both
    Appellants have at all times lawfully been within the UK and  they  are
    entitled therefore to have their private life examined  with  care  and
    due regard.  Finally Section 117B(vi) does not apply.

18. Thus an examination of the public  interest  demonstrates  that  it  is
    important, that these Appellants do not fit  into  any  category  which
    underscores the importance and raison d'�tre behind the public interest
    and it cannot be said therefore that  the  balance  of  proportionality
    obviously tilts towards the Respondent.

19. The Appellants have spent seven lawful years in the UK, where they have
    both  completely  integrated  into  society  and  both  have  been   in
    continuous employment contributing to the UK economy in a valuable  and
    positive way.  It is clear that that will continue in both their cases.
     The first Appellant has in four of the five year periods including the
    latest four periods been out of the UK for substantially less than  the
    180 days allowed.  The year he went beyond by twenty  or  so  days  was
    solely because he was sent to Saudi Arabia by his company to perform  a
    job that they believed he was, for a variety of  reasons,  best  suited
    to, and which was part of a project worth  seven  billion  US  dollars.
    The first Appellant further is a higher rate taxpayer.

20. In summary the Appellants have resided here for some time lawfully  and
    have made and continue to make a worthy and  valuable  contribution  to
    the UK and therefore to the public interest.  I find that a removal  is
    not in  the  pubic  interest  and  would  be  disproportionate  in  the
    circumstances of this case.

21. Finally I would observe the perhaps obvious point  that  there  are  no
    doubt many hundreds more worthy cases for consideration of  removal  by
    the Home Office and the utilisation of their resources in that respect.

Decision

22. In remaking this decision I dismiss the appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules but allow the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

23. No anonymity direction is made.
