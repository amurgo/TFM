For the Appellant:     Ms Fitzsimons, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis &
                    Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born in 1997.  He appeals to
    this Tribunal, on protection and  human  rights  grounds,  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision to refuse to grant him leave to remain.


 2. The Appellant has lived in this country since he was 12 years  old.  He
    arrived in October 2009 having made the  journey  from  Afghanistan  by
    land and sea and sought protection.  Although asylum was refused he was
    between  2010  and  2013  granted  a  period  of  Discretionary  Leave,
    subsequently extended by virtue of s3C of the Immigration Act 1971. The
    Appellant has however been without any leave to remain in this  country
    since he became 'appeal rights exhausted' on the 20th April  2016,  his
    appeal against the refusal of asylum having been dismissed by the First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Bennett).

 3. The history of the present proceedings  is  as  follows.  On  the  25th
    October  2016  the  Appellant  made  further  representations  to   the
    Secretary of State.  By  her  letter  of  the  18th  October  2019  the
    Secretary of State agreed to treat those representations  as  a  'fresh
    claim' on both protection and human rights grounds; she was not however
    prepared to grant leave.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. On the 12th  December  2019  the  matter  came  before  Judge
    Minhas, who by his decision of  the  9th  January  2020  dismissed  the
    appeal on all grounds. On the 6th  February  2020  First-tier  Tribunal
    Gumsley granted the Appellant permission to appeal  to  this  Tribunal.
    The matter was unfortunately then adjourned  because  of  the  Covid-19
    pandemic. It was not heard until the  15th  September  2020,  when  the
    'error of law' hearing was conducted via  remote  means.  On  the  28th
    October 2020 I handed down a decision setting  the  decision  of  Judge
    Minhas aside on all grounds. That decision  is  appended.   I  directed
    that the matter would be brought back before me for a  further  hearing
    in order that I could 're-make' the decision in the Appellant's appeal.
      In order to best facilitate the giving of live evidence this  was  to
    be a 'face to face'  hearing.   On  the  3rd  January  2021  the  Prime
    Minister announced that from Monday the 4th January the  country  would
    once again go into 'lockdown'.  I contacted the parties to see if  they
    wished to go ahead with a hearing at this time, particularly  since  it
    required travel into central London. The Appellant's solicitor informed
    me that both Counsel and the Appellant wished the appeal to  go  ahead,
    and Mr Lindsey for the Secretary of State similarly had no objection.




    Preliminary Issues


 4. At the outset of the hearing Mr Lindsey raised two preliminary issues.


 5. The first was that he did not consider it appropriate for the matter to
    proceed without the parties, or Tribunal, having had sight of the  2016
    decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bennett.  This  decision  is
    referred to in the Secretary of State's  refusal  letter,  and  in  the
    decision of Judge Minhas, but was not on the court file.    I  entirely
    agree. This issue was resolved by Ms Fitzsimons who was able to provide
    me with an electronic copy, and a hard copy to Mr Lindsey, who was then
    given time to read the decision.

 6. The second concerned a report in  the  Appellant's  bundle  dated  31st
    December 2020 by  Consultant  Psychiatrist  Dr  Nuwan  Galathappie.  At
    paragraph 10 there is a list  of  documents  that  Dr  Galathappie  had
    before him when he made his assessment.  The list does not include  the
    Secretary of State's reasons for refusal letter.   Mr Lindsey submitted
    that this was contrary to part 10.1 of the Practice Direction[1]:

         10.1. A party who  instructs  an  expert  must  provide  clear  and
         precise instructions to the  expert,  together  with  all  relevant
         information  concerning  the  nature  of  the   appellant's   case,
         including the appellant's immigration history, the reasons why  the
         appellant's claim or application has been refused by the respondent
         and copies of any relevant previous reports prepared in respect  of
         the appellant.

    Given the apparent failure of the Appellant's solicitors to provide  Dr
    Galathappie with a copy of the refusal letter, he  submitted  that  his
    expert report should be excluded from the evidence.

 7. I have had regard to The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    Rule 15(2):


         (2) The Upper Tribunal may-

         (a) admit evidence whether or not-

           (i) the evidence would be admissible in a civil trial in the
           United Kingdom; or

           (ii) the evidence was available to a previous decision maker; or

         (b) exclude evidence that would otherwise be admissible where-

           (i) the evidence was not provided within the time allowed by a
           direction or a practice direction;

           (ii) the evidence was otherwise provided in a manner that did
           not comply with a direction or a practice direction; or

           (iii) it would otherwise be unfair to admit the evidence.


 8. I accept that if there was indeed a failure to give the refusal  letter
    to Dr Galathappie this could potentially be contrary  to  the  Practice
    Direction. I am however mindful that Dr Galathappie was well  aware  of
    the why the Appellant has been refused asylum. That is because  he  was
    supplied with both of the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal, wherein
    extensive negative credibility findings are made, largely  echoing  the
    Respondent's position on  the  historical  narrative  advanced  by  the
    Appellant.  The Practice Direction requires that  the  expert  is  made
    aware of the "reasons why the appellant's claim or application has been
    refused by the respondent":  given  the  clear  terms  in  which  Judge
    Bennett in  particular  expressed  himself,  I  am  satisfied  that  Dr
    Galathappie was so aware.  For that reason, I do not consider it to  be
    in the interests of justice to exclude the  report  of  the  Consultant
    Psychiatrist.  I add for the sake of completeness that  Ms  Fitzsimons'
    instructions are that contrary to the face of the report, the  'reasons
    for refusal 'letter was included in the papers sent to the  doctor:  it
    is omitted from his list in error.


 9. Ms Fitzsimons raised a preliminary  issue  of  her  own.  She  made  an
    application for the Appellant to be treated as a vulnerable witness for
    the purpose of the Joint Presidential Practice Note No  2  of  2010.  I
    accept, in light of the medical evidence, that the Appellant should  be
    so treated.




    Matters in Issue

10. The Appellant maintains that he should be given further leave to remain
    on protection and human rights grounds.  Notwithstanding that there  is
    already a significant finding  in  the  Appellant's  favour  on  a  key
    protection issue [see �15 below] Ms Fitzsimons pursued the  Appellant's
    case on all available grounds[2]. That was of course a matter for  her,
    but that litigation strategy has resulted in this  decision  being  the
    length that it is, and in taking the time that it  has  to  make:  both
    parties have my apologies for any ensuing delay.  Here I summarise  the
    matters in issue, which I will discuss and resolve under  the  thematic
    headings below.


    The Refugee Claim


11. Notwithstanding the conclusions reached to the contrary  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Bennett in  2016,  the  Appellant  asserts  that  he  is
    entitled to protection as a refugee. He  has  a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution for reasons of his membership of a particular social group,
    namely a member of his own  family.  The  Appellant  asserts  that  his
    parents were killed in 2008 and that he would be at risk from the  same
    people who killed them.  This is a  matter  in  issue.  The  Respondent
    rejects the historical narrative about  what  happened  in  Afghanistan
    before the Appellant left as not  credible.   In  the  alternative  the
    Respondent submits that any risk that might have existed in 2008 is now
    negligible.


12. Alternatively, the Appellant submits that if he  returned  to  Nangahar
    today he would face a  real  risk  of  persecution  for  his  perceived
    political opinion, because he would be seen as 'westernized'. This  too
    is a matter in issue. The  Respondent  relies  on  the  extant  country
    guidance to submit that no such objective risk arises.

13. Finally, it is submitted that as an orphaned young  man  the  Appellant
    would be particularly vulnerable to forced recruitment by armed  groups
    operating in Nangahar, including  the  Taliban  and  Islamic  State  in
    Khurasan (ISIK or Daesh).

14. Each of these limbs require the Appellant to demonstrate that it  would
    be 'unduly harsh' to expect him to  internally  relocate.  This  is  in
    issue between the parties.  The submissions on this point were confined
    to the situation in Kabul: it is not  suggested  that  he  go  anywhere
    else.


    The Humanitarian Protection Claim

15.  Having  had  regard  to  the  Respondent's  policy  published  in  the
    Afghanistan CPIN Security and Humanitarian Situation  (July  2019)  the
    First-tier Tribunal accepted that the Appellant could not  be  returned
    to Nangahar because there exists there an internal armed conflict  such
    that he would face a real  risk  of  indiscriminate  violence.  At  the
    'error of law' hearing on the 15th  September  2020  Senior  Presenting
    Officer Mr McVeety indicated that this was the  Respondent's  position,
    and before  me  Mr  Lindsay  accepted  that  this  concession  set  the
    parameters of my enquiry.


16. The issue between the parties is whether it would be  unduly  harsh  to
    expect the Appellant to relocate within Afghanistan in order  to  avoid
    serious harm/indiscriminate violence.  As above, my enquiry is confined
    to the situation in Kabul.

    Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules

17. The Appellant asserts that he should be given leave to  remain  because
    there  are  "very  significant  obstacles"  to   his   integration   in
    Afghanistan generally, but in particular Kabul.


18. The Secretary of State does not accept that such obstacles exist.

    The Article 8 Claim

19. Beyond paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) the Appellant asserts that  his  removal
    from the United  Kingdom  today  would  amount  to  a  disproportionate
    interference with the family/private life that he has established  here
    in the past twelve years and so a breach of Article 8 ECHR.


20. The Respondent accepts that the Appellant  has  established  a  private
    life in the time that he has spent in the United Kingdom, but not  that
    the refusal to grant any further leave amounts  to  a  disproportionate
    interference, given the public  interest  considerations  expressed  in
    Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.




    The Evidence


21. The evidence falls into three parts.


22. First there is the Appellant's own evidence, supported to  some  degree
    by  the  written  evidence  of  his  cousin,  about  what  happened  in
    Afghanistan and why he left.

23. The second is subjective evidence about the Appellant's long residence,
    life and relationships in the United Kingdom.   This includes not  only
    the Appellant's own evidence,  but  the  compelling  and  helpful  oral
    testimony of his (former) foster mother, Mrs Din.    There are  also  a
    number of medico-legal reports that I have taken into account.


24. Finally, there is the  evidence  relating  to  the  Appellant's  likely
    circumstances should he be returned  to  Kabul.  I  must  consider  the
    'objective' country background material, the expert opinions  provided,
    and the more subjective evidence pertinent to how the  Appellant  might
    fare.

25. I have read, and have taken into account, all of  the  evidence  before
    me,   carefully   and   helpfully   presented   by   the    Appellant's
    representatives into a composite bundle. I have also had regard to  the
    2016 decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Bennett, which I must  treat
    as my starting point.



    The Refugee Claim

26. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in October 2009. There does
    not appear to have been any dispute about his age at the time, since he
    was placed in suitable  care  and  subsequently  granted  Discretionary
    Leave to Remain: he was then 12 years old.


27. He was interviewed on the 1st February 2010 with the  assistance  of  a
    Pushto interpreter.  He told officers he was  from  a  village  in  the
    Shershai  district  of  Nangahar:  he  was  able  to  name  surrounding
    localities and so that was accepted to be true.  He said  that  he  had
    left Afghanistan because he was afraid of the people who had killed his
    parents. Who they were, he did not know.

28. The Appellant was then questioned about  the  detail  of  his  parents'
    deaths for approximately two and  a  half  hours,  with  a  five-minute
    break. He was asked to describe the details of their injuries, how  the
    people who gathered in the aftermath came to be  there,  where  he  had
    been at the time, where he was going, how long it took him to get  back
    to the house and  who  he  thinks  might  have  done  it.  The  officer
    revisited areas of questioning and pressed  the  Appellant  on  certain
    matters, such as whether there had been signs of  "forced  entry  "into
    his house, and exactly how many bullet  wounds  he  could  see  on  the
    bodies of his dead parents.  I interpolate that this  kind  of  lengthy
    and intense questioning of a 12 year-old would, or  should,  not  occur
    today.  I have not however been asked to exclude that interview record,
    and what emerges from it is this.

29. The Appellant explained that on the day in question he was on  his  way
    to the mosque in order to attend midday prayers  when  he  met  with  a
    friend, who was also on  his  way  to  mosque.  This  friend  told  the
    Appellant that gunshots had been heard near to his  house.  The  friend
    carried on his way, but the Appellant was  curious  to  know  what  the
    shots might have been, so cautiously made his way  back  to  his  home.
    When he arrived, he saw that a crowd  of  people  had  gathered  there,
    including his maternal uncle. The Appellant went  inside  and  saw  the
    body of his father lying on the floor of the 'guestroom' (I  understand
    this to be a reference to the baytak, a  room  traditionally  found  in
    Pukhtun homes where the men of the house can receive  outside  visitors
    without them entering the main house itself). His mother's body was  in
    the kitchen. He was unable  to  say  whether  there  had  been  "forced
    entry".   Asked who he thought might have done this, he was  unable  to
    say.  In response to the officer's questions the  Appellant  said  that
    his father used to receive regular visits from men with  "long  beards"
    but he never heard the conversation as he was playing in the courtyard.
      In the aftermath of the killings his uncle  took  the  decision,  and
    made the appropriate  arrangements,  to  send  the  Appellant  and  his
    brother away.  They stayed with this uncle for some weeks before  being
    sent on their way to Europe.


30. As Tim Foxley[3] notes in his report of the 19th February 2016, all  of
    this was entirely unremarkable. Nangahar was at  the  material  time  a
    Taliban stronghold, and the group has been responsible for  the  deaths
    of thousands of civilians.  The account was therefore plausible in  the
    context of the background material.  Mr Foxley further comments that it
    was plausible in light of his knowledge of Afghani society: it would in
    his view be unlikely that the Appellant would be able to give any  more
    information than he did about the men with long beards,  or  what  they
    might have been discussing with his father.  Similarly  he  would  have
    been expected to follow his uncle's instructions without question.

31. The Appellant's claim was not however free of difficulties.

32. Prior to the interview he had completed an 'Statement of Evidence Form'
    (SEF) with his then representative. This had said that he was  actually
    in the mosque  when  he  received  the  news.  At  the  interview  this
    discrepancy had been put to him and he had said that the statement  was
    wrong - this was a mistake.  The Respondent, and  then  Judge  Bennett,
    found this discrepancy to weigh against him. In his decision of the 5th
    April 2016 Judge Bennett found "a boy of  twelve  might  ordinarily  be
    expected to have no difficulty in remembering  where  he  was  when  an
    event occurred that saw the start  of  a  very  significant  series  of
    events in his life...".

33. A second matter found by Judge Bennett to weigh against  the  Appellant
    arose from the claimed actions of his  uncle  after  the  killing.  The
    Appellant had said that his uncle  had  taken  the  Appellant  and  his
    brother back to his house, and told  them  to  stay  indoors,  but  had
    himself gone somewhere because he was afraid. Judge Bennett found  this
    to make little sense: if the uncle believed his home to  be  a  target,
    why would he leave his nephews there?

34. The decision makers who have gone before have  further  had  regard  to
    other material not available to me. I note from the decision  of  Judge
    Bennett that the original refusal letter had identified  a  discrepancy
    between the Appellant's account, and that given by his brother who also
    claimed asylum in the UK.  It appears that one of them (it is not clear
    to me which) described their destination that day as the madrassa,  the
    other said it was the mosque. One thought that it took half an hour  to
    walk from there to their home, the other thought it was  one  and  half
    hours.   The brother's appeal had been dismissed by a Judge  Broe,  who
    had found that the claim lacked credibility, as I understand it because
    the brother had produced a 'death card' indicating that his mother  had
    died of her injuries in hospital:  when  it  was  pointed  out  to  the
    brother that this was inconsistent with his account he had changed  his
    story, a development which as Judge Bennett put it, "sowed the seeds of
    his own destruction",  at  least  insofar  as  his  asylum  appeal  was
    concerned.  There was confusion over how the boys' uncle came to arrive
    at the house that day.  A further discrepancy  arose  between  the  two
    claims in that the Appellant did not think that they had ever known the
    telephone number of that maternal uncle; his brother  claimed  to  have
    had the number, tried it twice, but then it had gone dead.  All of this
    led Judge Bennett to conclude that  the  account  was  not  capable  of
    discharging the burden of proof and the appeal was dismissed.


35. In evaluating the  narrative  today  my  starting  point  must  be  the
    findings of Judge Bennett which stand as an authoritative determination
    of the claim as it was presented on the 5th April  2016:  Devaseelan  v
    Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2002]  UKIAT  00702.   I
    should only depart from those findings if there is some  reason  to  do
    so.


36. Ms Fitzsimons asked me to do so on the basis of the new evidence  which
    had led the Secretary of State to accept the further  submissions  made
    on behalf of the Appellant as a 'fresh claim' under  paragraph  353  of
    the Immigration Rules.

37. The first item was an updated report by Mr Foxley dated 6th July  2017.
    I have not derived any real assistance from this report. Although I  do
    not in any way doubt Mr Foxley's expertise, its contents -  insofar  as
    they relate to the  plausibility  of  the  Appellant's  account  -  add
    nothing to the report already prepared by Mr Foxley and  placed  before
    Judge Bennett in 2016.    That the account was plausible in the context
    of the background material does not appear to have ever been in doubt.

38. The second item  was  a  statement  dated  4th  December  2019  by  the
    Appellant's cousin Ajmal Ali,  who  provided  a  copy  of  his  British
    passport as evidence of identity. There are two matters that limit  the
    weight that I can attach to this evidence. The first is  that  although
    Mr Ali did attend the hearing before Judge  Minhas  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, he did not attend the hearing before me, and so  I  have  not
    seen his evidence tested.  The second is  that  Mr  Ali  is  unable  to
    confirm any specific detail of the Appellant's account, since he was in
    the UK at all material times. I note however that he is able to confirm
    was that it is his belief that both of  the  Appellant's  parents  were
    killed in Afghanistan in 2009.  He states that he  does  not  know  who
    killed his uncle and his wife, but the family believe it to  have  been
    the Taliban.

39. The third tranche of evidence relates to the Appellant's mental health.
    I am provided with a report from Consultant Psychiatrist Dr Galathappie
    dated the 31st December 2020,  and  a  report  by  Consultant  Clinical
    Psychologist Dr  Rachel  Thomas  dated  the  4th  December  2019.   The
    headline conclusion of both of these well  qualified  professionals  is
    that the Appellant is suffering from  severe  depression,  anxiety  and
    post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  Much  was  said  about  both
    advocates before me about the weight  that  I  could  attach  to  these
    diagnoses when I consider whether to depart from the findings of  Judge
    Bennett.

40. Ms Fitzsimons pointed to Dr Galathappie's  view  that  the  Appellant's
    account of events  in  Afghanistan  is  consistent  with  his  reported
    symptoms which  include  flashbacks,  nightmares,  low  mood,  anxiety,
    tearfulness, poor concentration,  intrusive  distressing  memories  and
    fearfulness.  In his opinion the trauma  of  losing  his  parents,  and
    seeing their dead bodies, "would have directly  caused  his  PTSD"  [at
    �87].  Dr Thomas reaches similar conclusions. Ms Fitzsimons accordingly
    asks me to place considerable weight on these reports in my  Devaseelan
    analysis of whether the account advanced by the Appellant  can  now  be
    accepted to be true.

41. In his submissions Mr Lindsay reiterated his complaint about a  failure
    to comply with the Practice Direction, which I have already dealt  with
    [see above at my �6-8]. He further suggested that  neither  doctor  had
    addressed what might be called the countervailing factors - namely  the
    discrepancies identified by Judge Bennett. That failure,  submitted  Mr
    Lindsay, mean that Dr Galathappie's views should "not  carry  any  real
    weight at all".  Insofar as both doctors had, in  compliance  with  the
    Istanbul Protocol and the caselaw of this Tribunal, directed themselves
    to consider whether  the  Appellant  could  be  feigning  symptoms,  Mr
    Lindsay asked me to  reject  their  professional  evaluations  on  this
    matter as "wholly  unsustainable",  because  neither  had  referred  to
    academic  sources.  Dr  Thomas  had  not,  for  instance,  offered  any
    objective support for her view that many of the  symptoms  reported  by
    the Appellant,  such  as  appetite  disturbance,  are  not  immediately
    obvious to the layperson as being symptoms of psychiatric disorder.

42. I am satisfied that both doctors are suitably qualified and  that  they
    have generally presented fair reports in compliance with their  Ikarian
    Reefer duties to this Tribunal. They both make a point of  saying  that
    they have assessed that the Appellant is not exaggerating  or  feigning
    symptoms, and as experienced professionals, that is a matter for  them.
    I found nothing inappropriate in the comments made by  Dr  Thomas,  who
    noted that the Appellant presented a "considered and balanced  view  of
    his psychiatric symptoms", and that this would  be  "most  unusual  for
    someone attempting to fabricate  psychiatric  disorder"  who  would  be
    expected to exaggerate. She also recorded her own observations  of  the
    Appellant's low mood and  "markedly  flattened  emotional  affect".   I
    entirely reject Mr Lindsay's  submission  that  these  comments  should
    attract  no  weight  because  they  were  not  supported  by   academic
    reference: Dr Thomas is the expert. She is  a  Consultant  Psychologist
    with 18 years PQE and long experience in assessing survivors of trauma.
     She need not footnote every comment or observation in her report.

43. That said, I must accept the criticism made by Mr Lindsay that  neither
    Dr Thomas  or  Dr  Galathappie  appears  to  have  weighed  into  their
    evaluation the evidence that the Appellant  reported  being  happy  and
    settled with Mrs Din and her late  husband  in  the  years  immediately
    following his arrival.   In her evidence Mrs Din reported that  at  the
    time the Appellant had told a social worker that  he  was  "in  heaven"
    living in her home, and Mr Lindsay is entitled  to  wonder  whether  Dr
    Galathappie would have drawn such a direct  line  between  the  claimed
    murder of the Appellant's parents and his PTSD, had he  been  aware  of
    that evidence, relating as it does to a period more proximate  in  time
    to the claimed events than today.  I further accept that Dr Galathappie
    has not expressly considered whether  the  Appellant's  symptoms  might
    have  other  causes.  He  refers,  for  instance,  to  the  Appellant's
    detention in an Immigration Removal Centre, and is plainly  aware  that
    he traversed Asia and Europe as a young child, but  does  not  squarely
    address the very real possibility that either or both of this matters -
    what Dr Thomas summarises as "cumulatively  traumatic  life  events"  -
    could have given  rise  to  the  mental  health  issues  faced  by  the
    Appellant today.


44. I do not however think  for  one  moment  that  any  of  the  diagnoses
    presented in these reports, and produced  by  clinical  assessment,  is
    wrong. The Appellant arrived in this country on his own, aged  12.  The
    Respondent has never challenged the evidence that in order to get  here
    the Appellant spent many  months  in  the  company  of  violent  people
    traffickers. Implicit in that is an acceptance that whatever the  truth
    might be about why he left Afghanistan, the  Appellant  was  dislocated
    from his immediate family at a young age and has never seen them again.
    Although he found happiness and some measure of security in the home of
    his foster family the Dins, it is  hard  to  imagine  that  these  life
    events would not take their toll  on  the  Appellant's  mental  health.
    Add to this the incessant insecurity that he has experienced since  his
    last grant of leave expired in 2013, including a period in  immigration
    detention, and it is clear to see, even for the layperson, why he might
    be  suffering  from  depression,  anxiety  and  post-traumatic   stress
    disorder.   It is for that reason that the general diagnoses  made  add
    little to my Devaseelan enquiry.  Had they been known to Judge  Bennett
    in 2016 they would have been of the same probative value  as  they  are
    today: limited.  Whilst they are wholly  consistent  with  his  claimed
    history, there are many other possible causes.   The  Appellant's  PTSD
    cannot in these circumstances logically establish that his parents were
    killed in the manner he describes.


45. There is however one specific point arising from  the  medical  reports
    which does merit considerably more weight in my evaluation. That is the
    evidence  of  Dr  Thomas  that  such  narrative  discrepancies  as  are
    identified by the Respondent (and Judge Bennett) could be explained  by
    reference to the Appellant's conditions. She writes [from her �66] that
    the Appellant:

         "....is  showing  considerable  cognitive  impairment  and  slowing
         consequent  on  a  severe  depressive  disorder  and  I   consider,
         therefore, that psychiatric  factors  are  of  real  importance  in
         relation to inconsistency  of  narrative  and  if  these  have  not
         previously been considered in  determining  credibility  then  this
         needs to be undertaken.


         There are also factors relating to age and developmental trauma and
         its impact on memory that may well have impacted on the information
         [the Appellant] is able to recall from his time in Afghanistan.  He
         instructs that he was 12 years old when his  parents  were  killed,
         that he saw their dead  bodies  and  that  he  was  made  to  leave
         Afghanistan rapidly thereafter with an agent and endure a long  and
         arduous journey as an unaccompanied minor to the UK. It can readily
         be seen how the cumulatively traumatic nature of these  experiences
         at a very young age will have contributed to [the Appellant]  being
         liable to forget details of this time.


         Indeed, [he] stated at interview, as described above, that  he  has
         blocked out memories of his time in Afghanistan in a form of  post-
         traumatic avoidance because these have been so traumatic to him"


46. That expert opinion was not available to Judge Bennett in 2016. Nor,  I
    note, was the decision of the Court of Appeal  in  AM  (Afghanistan)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1123,  which
    was handed down the  following  year.  Given  the  terms  in  which  he
    expressed himself, I cannot be satisfied that Judge Bennett's  decision
    would have been as it was, had the medical evidence, and  the  decision
    in AM, been before him. Had the procedural fairness issues canvassed in
    AM been raised here, the Appellant would undoubtedly have been  treated
    as a vulnerable witness, and his evidence assessed accordingly.   Judge
    Bennett's formulation "a boy of twelve might ordinarily be expected  to
    have no difficulty in remembering..." is now, in light  of  Dr  Thomas'
    evidence, obviously problematic.   As her report makes clear, it is not
    in fact in the case that a boy of twelve would ordinarily  be  able  to
    accurately recall all the details of a deeply traumatic event:  to  the
    contrary the human brain will deliberately block  memories  or  certain
    details as a  self-protection  mechanism.  This  phenomena,  of  "post-
    traumatic avoidance", could be one explanation  for  the  matters  that
    troubled Judge Bennett.  Another  could  be  the  Appellant's  personal
    characteristics:  he  is  found,  on  clinical  assessment,   to   have
    "considerable cognitive impairment".


47. I have given consideration to the countervailing factors identified  by
    the Respondent and by Judge Bennett.   As I wrote in my 'error of  law'
    decision I attach no weight  at  all  to  the  Appellant's  fluctuating
    evidence on how long it might have taken him to walk from A to B on the
    day in question.  It may be reasonable to expect an  adult  witness  to
    accurately state the time span of  a  journey  taken  with  regularity,
    since the time that such a  journey  will  take  will  inevitably  have
    significance in the ordering of that  adult's  daily  life.  I  am  not
    however prepared to accept that a 12 year  old  wandering  through  the
    Afghan countryside with his brother could  accurately  be  expected  to
    recount journey times, particularly on a day where, if the  account  is
    true,  he  suffered  the  greatest  trauma  of  his  life.  As  to  his
    inconsistent evidence on the point, I bear in mind  that  children  are
    apt to say whatever comes into their head  rather  than  simply  saying
    that they do not know.   For the same reason I attach minimal weight to
    the Appellant's flustered attempts to say how  and  when  his  maternal
    uncle arrived on the scene. Mr Foxley rightly notes that  it  would  be
    culturally inappropriate for an Afghan  child  to  question  his  uncle
    about decisions pertaining directly to him: it seems very unlikely that
    the Appellant would then have cross-examined his  uncle  about  how  he
    came to have arrived at the murder scene so quickly.


48. As to where the Appellant was when he was told about  the  gunshots,  I
    recognise the difference in the accounts given, but read that  them  in
    light of the expert opinion of Dr Thomas  about  the  unreliability  of
    memory in such circumstances.

49. Weighing in the Appellant's favour are the following matters. That  the
    account has been, at its core, consistent over many retellings over  an
    eleven-year period. It is an account wholly consonant with the  country
    background material: as Mr Foxley explains, Nangahar, and in particular
    the rural areas,  were  in  2009  firmly  in  the  grip  of  a  Taliban
    insurgency which claimed many thousands of  civilian  lives.  The  very
    young age of the Appellant when he embarked on his journey  would  tend
    to indicate that there was some  pressing  reason  for  him  to  leave.
    Although there is a limit to the weight that I can place  on  Mr  Ali's
    evidence, I have taken into account  the  fact  that  he  attended  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal to confirm his belief  that  his
    uncle and aunt were  indeed  shot  dead.  Some  small  weight  is  also
    attracted by the Appellant's mental health sequalae of trauma. Applying
    the lower standard of proof and bearing in mind the  Appellant's  youth
    at the time that the account was originally given, I am satisfied  that
    it is reasonably likely that the account given is at its core  true.  I
    accept that the Appellant's parents were killed by  unknown  assailants
    and that an uncle made arrangements for him to leave the country.


50. That does not mean, however, that he has made out a real  risk  arising
    from these facts today. These events took place  11  years  ago.    The
    Appellant has no real idea of who might have  killed  his  parents,  or
    why. Nor, according to Mr Ali, does anyone else in the family, who  can
    only speculate that  it  was  the  Taliban.   Whilst  that  supposition
    accords with the  background  material,  which  demonstrates  that  the
    Taliban take brutal reprisals against those  they  perceive  to  oppose
    them, there is no indication in the evidence that this was in fact  the
    case. The fact that men with beards visited the family home to sit  and
    talk with the Appellant's father takes  the  analysis  nowhere.  I  was
    taken to no evidence supporting the notion that the Taliban in Nangahar
    would seek to kill the son of a family who got in their  way  11  years
    ago, particularly since that son was a young boy  at  the  time.   Even
    applying the lower standard of proof, and the Demirkaya presumption  in
    paragraph 339K of the Immigration Rules, I am unable to accept that the
    Appellant faces a real risk of harm from his parents' murderers today.

51. It  is  no  doubt  because  of  that  difficulty  that  Ms  Fitzsimons'
    submissions on the Refugee Convention were in the  alternative  put  on
    two other bases.

52. The first was that the  Appellant  would  attract  the  enmity  of  the
    Taliban, or possibly the new threat in the area, Islamic State, because
    he is "westernized".  A considerable amount of energy  is  expended  in
    the Appellant's statement on this topic, but I am unable to do any more
    than point to the fact  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  recently,  and
    categorically, rejected the assertion  that  "westernised"  individuals
    face a real risk of harm in Afghanistan for that reason. This  was  the
    finding of the Tribunal in AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG  [2018]
    UKUT 118 (IAC) at [�187]:


         We do not find a person on return  to  Kabul,  or  more  widely  to
         Afghanistan, to be at risk on the basis of 'Westernisation'.  There
         is simply a lack of any cogent or consistent evidence of  incidents
         of such harm on which it could be concluded that there was  a  real
         risk to a person who has spent time in the west being targeted  for
         that reason, either because  of  appearance,  perceived  or  actual
         attitudes of such a person.  At most, there is some evidence  of  a
         possible adverse social impact or suspicion  affecting  social  and
         family interactions, and evidence from a very small number of  fear
         based on 'Westernisation', but we find that the evidence before  us
         falls far short of establishing and objective fear  of  persecution
         on this basis for the purposes of the Refugee Convention.

53. This finding was not challenged to  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  so  is
    expressly upheld in AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2020] UKUT 130
    (IAC) at �7.  I should say that it is not entirely clear to me on what
    basis the Tribunal extended the scope of its enquiry to "more widely in
    Afghanistan": as far as I can tell the evidence and submissions in  the
    appeal before it related solely  to  Kabul.    Ms  Fitzsimons  did  not
    however ask me to depart from that country guidance, and so by  law  am
    bound to apply it.

54. The final basis upon which refugee protection is sought is that  as  an
    unattached young man - that is to say exposed by his lack of  family  -
    the Appellant would today face a real risk  of  forced  recruitment  or
    exploitation by armed groups operating in his home area of Nangahar.


55. I am unable to draw any assistance from AS on  this  point.   It  would
    appear that the last time this  risk  was  considered,  albeit  in  the
    context of children, was in HK  and  others  (minors  -  indiscriminate
    violence - forced recruitment by Taliban - contact with family members)
    Afghanistan CG [2010] UKUT 378 (IAC) where the guidance given was this:


          While forcible recruitment by the Taliban cannot be discounted  as
         a risk, particularly in areas of high militant activity or militant
         control, evidence is required to show that it is a  real  risk  for
         the particular child concerned and not a mere possibility.

56. Nothing in the evidence produced before me suggests that this situation
    has changed.


57. In his report of the 19th February 2016 Mr Foxley writes that "coercion
    is not the Taliban's  preferred  method  of  recruitment.  The  Taliban
    generally prefer to appeal - with some success,  given  that  they  are
    maintaining a strong insurgency force in its 11th year -  to  potential
    recruits' sense of pride, xenophobia, nationalism or Islam" [at  Foxley
    �51].   In  his  second  report,  of  the  6th  July  2017,  Mr  Foxley
    acknowledges that it is possible that the  Appellant  could  fall  into
    that group of "vulnerable, suggestible and immature Pushtun youth"  [at
    �56], but I find it to be clear from the evidence that this is not  so:
    the Appellant makes clear that he regards himself as "westernized" with
    no political or religious leaning towards extremism. It is in  my  view
    extremely unlikely that he would fall under the sway of the Taliban  in
    the manner outlined by Mr Foxley, and if he did, as a man of  23  years
    old, that is a matter for which he would be responsible.

58. I am therefore not satisfied that the Appellant has made  out  a  claim
    under the Refugee Convention for any of the three reasons  advanced  by
    his representatives.



    Humanitarian Protection

59. Notwithstanding the  United  Kingdom's  withdrawal  from  the  European
    Union,  the  'minimum  standards'  of  protection  set   out   in   the
    Qualification Directive continue to find expression in the  Immigration
    Rules:

         339C. A person will be granted humanitarian protection in the
         United Kingdom if the Secretary of State is satisfied that:


           (i) they are in the United Kingdom or have arrived at a port of
           entry in the United Kingdom;
           (ii) they do not qualify as a refugee as defined in regulation 2
           of The Refugee or Person in Need of International Protection
           (Qualification) Regulations 2006;
           (iii) substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the
           person concerned, if returned to the country of return, would
           face a real risk of suffering serious harm and is unable, or,
           owing to such risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the
           protection of that country; and
           (iv) they are not excluded from a grant of humanitarian
         protection.


         339CA. For the purposes of paragraph 339C, serious harm consists
         of:


           (i) the death penalty or execution;
           (ii) unlawful killing;
           (iii) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of
           a person in the country of return; or
           (iv) serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or
           person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of
           international or internal armed conflict.


60. The First-tier  Tribunal  found,  in  unchallenged  findings,  that  in
    Nangahar the Appellant would face a serious and  individual  threat  to
    his life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in a  situation
    of internal armed conflict.  The question remains whether it  would  be
    reasonable to expect the Appellant to avoid such  harms  by  internally
    relocating to Kabul.


61. In my assessment of whether it would be 'unduly harsh'  to  expect  the
    Appellant to live in Kabul Ms Fitzsimons asks me to have regard to  the
    following factors:


              i) The Appellant has never lived in Kabul  and  has  no  known
                 connection to the city


             ii) He has never lived in Afghanistan as an adult  and  so  has
                 little to no understanding of how things 'work' in terms of
                 the job market, obtaining housing etc

            iii)  Although  falling  short  of  Article  15(c)   conditions,
                 security and crime remain significant problems in Kabul

             iv) The Appellant  is  already  suffering  from  mental  health
                 difficulties and returning him to  the  country  where  his
                 trauma occurred would likely exacerbate those problems

              v) The objective evidence indicates that he would be  unlikely
                 to be able to access meaningful mental health treatment  or
                 support

             vi) His mental illness will make him stand out, and render  him
                 vulnerable

            vii) He would face societal hostility (albeit falling  short  of
                 persecution) because he will be perceived as 'westernized'

           viii) As  an  internally  displaced  person  (IDP)  he  would  be
                 particularly vulnerable to Covid-19

             ix) The pandemic should further be considered in  that  it  has
                 placed  a  considerable  burden  on  the  already  strained
                 resources available to IDPs in Kabul


62. For his part Mr Lindsay asked me to take  into  account  the  following
    submissions:


              i) The Appellant is a physically healthy adult male


             ii) The extent of his mental health issues is exaggerated


            iii) The Appellant said  in  oral  evidence  that  he  would  be
                 prepared to work as a builder if he could find a  job,  and
                 he has had some vocational training in construction work

             iv) He speaks Pushto, and to the extent that he may  have  lost
                 familiarity with it through a lack of daily use,  it  would
                 not take him long to recover it

              v) Mrs Din could  provide  him  with  some  financial  support
                 whilst he 'got on his feet'

             vi) Although he may not be a devout Muslim he has  demonstrated
                 his ability to 'fit in' by the evidence of how  he  manages
                 to meet the expectations of Mrs Din in this regard


63. My starting point is the recent country guidance in AS [2020]:


         Having regard to the security and humanitarian situation  in  Kabul
         as well as the difficulties faced by the  population  living  there
         (primarily the urban poor but also IDPs and other returnees,  which
         are not dissimilar to the conditions faced  throughout  many  other
         parts of Afghanistan) it will not, in general, be  unreasonable  or
         unduly harsh for a single adult male in good health to relocate  to
         Kabul even if he does not have any specific connections or  support
         network in Kabul and even if he does not have a Tazkera.


         However, the particular circumstances of  an  individual  applicant
         must be taken into account in the  context  of  conditions  in  the
         place of relocation, including a person's age, nature  and  quality
         of  support  network/connections  with   Kabul/Afghanistan,   their
         physical and mental  health,  and  their  language,  education  and
         vocational skills when determining whether a  person  falls  within
         the general position set out above. Given the limited  options  for
         employment, capability to undertake manual work may be relevant.


         A person with a support network or specific connections in Kabul is
         likely to be in a more advantageous position on return,  which  may
         counter a particular vulnerability of an individual  on  return.  A
         person without a network may  be  able  to  develop  one  following
         return. A person's familiarity with the cultural and societal norms
         of Afghanistan (which may be affected by the age at which  he  left
         the country and his length of absence) will be relevant to whether,
         and if so how quickly and successfully, he will be able to build  a
         network.


64. Having regard to that guidance I  note  that  it  is  not  in  general,
    unreasonable to expect a returnee to settle in Kabul.  I  must  however
    examine, cumulatively, each of  the  specific  factors  raised  by  the
    representatives as being relevant to the Appellant. I  begin  with  the
    external, that is to say the social, economic and security situation in
    which the Appellant will find himself.


65. The security situation in Kabul is poor.  Although the Tribunal  in  AS
    rejected the submission that conditions in the city  have  deteriorated
    to the extent that Article 15(c) is engaged,  its  clear  findings  are
    that it can still be a dangerous place:


         201. Kabul (both the city and province) is  significantly  affected
         by widespread and longstanding conflict-related  violence  and  has
         been - at a relatively consistent level - since at least 2016. Some
         of the violence is targeted (e.g. at police,  embassies  or  ethnic
         groups) but  much  of  it  is  indiscriminate.  Even  the  targeted
         violence affects civilians in an indiscriminate way, because people
         can be killed or injured as bystanders. There is also a significant
         problem of violent crime.


66. In respect of political violence, the Tribunal found that the  risk  to
    the civilian depended on behaviour: someone who stays at home  all  the
    time is at far lower risk than someone who is economically  active  and
    must be out on the streets looking for work in crowded places.  Further
    "someone who has an understanding of the culture and  society  will  be
    more adept at  avoiding  violence  than  someone  who  is  ignorant  of
    societal norms" [�202].  In respect of crime,  the  Tribunal  cite  the
    2019 findings of the Asia Foundation Survey which reported that 15%  of
    the population were affected by crime during the year.


67.  The  city  itself  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  in  the  world.
    Approximately 8% of the population are IDPs. The Tribunal  acknowledges
    the concern expressed by the UNCHR and human rights organisations  that
    the "influx of IDPs and refugees has  put  a  huge  strain  on  Kabul's
    infrastructure, and that the city is, or is  close  to  being,  at  the
    limits of its capacity to absorb any further  people"  [�220].   It  is
    against that background,  the  panel  finds,  that  the  socio-economic
    situation conditions are extremely challenging:

            224. The Panel in the 2018  UT  decision  found  that  much  of
            Kabul's population lives in inadequate  informal  housing  with
            limited access to basic services such as sanitation and potable
            water. They noted that healthcare provision, although poor,  is
            better in Kabul than elsewhere.




            225. The evidence before us  indicates  that  the  position  is
            unchanged. As was the case when the Panel made its findings  in
            the 2018 UT decision, most of Kabul's population is poor, lives
            in inadequate housing with inadequate sanitation, lacks  access
            to potable water, and struggles to earn  sufficient  income  to
            sustain itself in a society without any safety net.


68. Ms Fitzsimons asked me to note that these findings were  based  on  the
    evidence as it stood in 2019. She points to the evidence of  Dr  Ayesha
    Ahmad to submit that during the course of the past year the  impact  of
    the Covid-19 pandemic has made a bad situation  for  IDPs  considerably
    worse.  Before I consider Dr Ahmad's evidence  on  this  point,  it  is
    appropriate that I comment generally on the evidence she has  given  in
    her two reports, dated 4th December 2019 and the 4th January 2021.


69. Dr Ahmad lectures at St  Georges,  and  at  the  Institute  for  Global
    Health, both part of the University of London.    Her expertise  is  in
    global health and she was, at the date  of  writing,  involved  in  two
    projects examining  the  mental  health  sequalae  of  trauma,  with  a
    particular focus on Afghanistan.  She has published numerous  articles,
    edited books and is a contributor to The Lancet.    She  describes  her
    areas of expertise as psychological trauma  and  mental  health  during
    post-conflict, disability, gender-based violence,  gender  in  conflict
    and extreme settings, mental health,  and  the  impact  of  culture  on
    mental illness.   Insofar as Dr Ahmad's  reports  address  sociological
    issues relating to mental health, and health generally, in Afghanistan,
    I wholly accept her expertise. This is  her  area  of  study,  and  her
    reports are well referenced; she has drawn on a wide variety of sources
    and brought her own expertise to  bear  on  the  raw  data  to  provide
    helpful analysis.

70. What is less clear is why Dr Ahmad has been asked to comment on matters
    such as the current security situation in Nangahar, and  whether  there
    is a 'sufficiency of protection' provided by the state.  I do not doubt
    that Dr Ahmad has a general familiarity with the security background to
    her work, but she is not an expert on  these  matters,  as  her  report
    illustrates: in  response  to  these  instructions  she  can  offer  no
    meaningful contribution other than to cite other reports, all of  which
    are available to the Tribunal, and in many cases already dealt with  in
    the country guidance.   This is a case where the Appellant's solicitors
    had, at the point that they instructed Dr Ahmad, already  obtained  two
    country reports by Mr Foxley. Mr Foxley is, as the Secretary  of  State
    has repeatedly accepted before this  Tribunal,  an  eminent  expert  on
    security matters in Afghanistan. There was no point at all in asking Dr
    Ahmad to re-cover this ground. She is not, and does not claim to be, an
    expert on matters such as "the current risk to civilians in  Nangahar",
    and  her  instructions  should  not  have  included  such  questions  -
    particularly since, in the case of the most recent report,  that was  a
    matter already settled by the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    make no criticism of Dr Ahmad for attempting to set her work in context
    by answering the questions put to her, but those instructing  Dr  Ahmad
    may wish to reflect on the utility of obtaining, and paying  for,  such
    extraneous evidence.


71. I return to Dr Ahmad's work on healthcare below, but in the context  of
    the humanitarian situation generally I note her January  2021  evidence
    that the significant challenges and  obstacles  already  faced  by  the
    population have been magnified by the pandemic.  She reports  that  the
    Assessment Capabilities Project Taskforce estimate that over the winter
    of 2020-21 there will be a significant increase in the number of people
    facing 'crisis' or 'high' levels of food insecurity in Afghanistan,  up
    from 11.1 million to 13.1 million.  The risk of humanitarian crisis  is
    very high with Afghanistan scoring 8/10 on the  INFORM  risk  scale[4].
    I accept that the effects of the pandemic, bad everywhere,  are  likely
    to be severe in a country such  as  Afghanistan,  and  that  this  will
    necessarily exacerbate the socio-economic challenges already  found  to
    exist at the time of AS.

72. As to the ability of individual returnees to  survive  economically  in
    such challenging circumstances, the Tribunal in AS found that family or
    other  social  networks  are  an  important  advantage,  but  are   not
    essential. A lone male may be able, in time, to build his own  network.
    At [�229] the Tribunal further noted: "even a person who is  unable  to
    form any such connections, and who must survive without the benefit  of
    a network, will ordinarily be able to find inexpensive accommodation in
    a 'chai khana' and (depending on physical abilities, health  and  other
    individual characteristics) be able work  as  a  day  labourer  in  the
    informal labour market in Kabul".  The reality of  a  'chai  khana'  is
    described as involving "sharing a (dirty and unlocked) room and washing
    facilities- and would lack privacy"; having regard  to  the  conditions
    generally in Kabul the Tribunal  found  that  for  a  single  man  such
    readily  available  and  cheap   accommodation   would   be   adequate.
    Returnees are on arrival provided with sufficient funds - approximately
    �125 - to pay for a few weeks of such accommodation.

73. In  respect  of  the  attitude  of  the  population  generally  towards
    returnees the Tribunal in AS was  referred  to  a  German  study  which
    concluded that they can face violence  and  hostility.  At  [�246]  the
    Tribunal accepted that "some people in  Kabul  are  suspicious  of  and
    hostile towards returnees. However, the evidence before us,  considered
    together and  as  a  whole,  points  to  returnees  facing  challenging
    circumstances not because they have returned from the west  (risk  from
    westernisation was categorically rejected in the 2018 UT  decision  (at
    para. 187) and this finding was not appealed), but primarily because of
    poverty,  lack  of  accommodation  and  the   absence   of   employment
    opportunities, as well as the security situation.

74. I now turn to the evidence on mental health. In its 2018 decision in AS
    (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT  118  (IAC)  the  Tribunal
    made the following undisturbed finding:

          142.  In terms of mental  health  care,  the  same  EASO  Report
         recorded very high levels of mental health problems in  Afghanistan
         (particularly depression, anxiety and  PTSD)  creating  significant
         needs  but  that  there  was  a  lack  of   trained   professionals
         (psychiatrists, social workers, psychologists)  and  an  inadequate
         infrastructure.  Although the Public Health Minister reported  that
         psychological services were available at some 1,500 health  centres
         around the country with 300 dedicated mental health clinics;  there
         was only one dedicated mental health hospital in Kabul  and  Samual
         Hall's study in 2016 referred to there  being  only  three  trained
         psychiatrists and ten psychologists in the whole of Afghanistan.


75. To that bleak picture Dr Ahmad adds that mental  health  provision  has
    suffered disproportionately because of  the  poor  security  situation.
    Targeted attacks against healthcare facilities "are  a  further  reason
    why mental  health  fails  to  be  prioritized  because  accessing  any
    healthcare treatment has to be balanced against the risk of  travelling
    and attending to treatment clinics".  In June  2019  the  World  Health
    Organisation published statistics to the effect that 1 in 5  people  in
    post-conflict settings are suffering from  "depression,  anxiety,  post
    traumatic stress disorder, bipolar  disorder  or  schizophrenia":  this
    needs to be contrasted with the figure  of  1  in  14  for  the  global
    population at large.   This is the context in which the lack of  mental
    health provision in Afghanistan needs to be seen: 40 years of  conflict
    has left behind a "mental health epidemic".


76. That prevalence notwithstanding, the literature review conducted by  Dr
    Ahmad demonstrates that mental health issues continue to be stigmatized
    and misunderstood. In the absence  of  formal  or  effective  treatment
    Afghanis tend to characterise mental distress  either  in  non-clinical
    terms - just being 'sad' -  or,  as  the  possession  of  the  body  by
    malevolent  spirits.    A  2016  study  (Ahmad  and  Dein)  found   the
    stigmatisation of poor mental health in  Afghanistan  arises  from  the
    individual being perceived as having a weak faith, or having  committed
    a morally wrongful act, such a spiritual deficiency allowing  the  jinn
    to take over.  Once an individual is perceived to be so possessed -  to
    be in a state of peryan - the obvious solution is  simply  to  turn  to
    prayer. Dr Ahmad reports on the harrowing  practice  of  the  seriously
    mentally ill being chained in shrines for 40 days, the length  of  time
    considered to be required for a person to heal  from  jinn  possession.
    During such confinement they are provided with  a  particular  diet  of
    bread, water and black pepper, which must be eaten near to the grave of
    a saint  or  pir.   Efforts  by  the  Afghan  government  to  implement
    'western' style mental health treatments  such  as  talking  therapies,
    have been stymied  by  such  beliefs:  talking  openly  about  personal
    matters in counselling is not considered culturally  appropriate.  That
    these attitudes are widely held, Dr Ahmad writes,  is  one  reason  why
    services  continue  to  be  so  lacking  and  under-prioritized:    WHO
    reported in 2019 that care providers in both the  formal  and  informal
    sectors found themselves subject to stigma and human rights  violations
    because they undertake that work.  Dr Ahmad cites a 2017 academic study
    (Wildt et al) to summarise the situation on the ground:


         "primary care physicians and primary health care workers often have
         little or no training in mental health, may  not  recognise  mental
         disorders, have limited access to psychiatric  medicine,  and  have
         few outside mental health agencies to whom they can refer".


77. Against that background I consider the personal characteristics of  the
    Appellant.

78. The Appellant grew up speaking Pushto  and  has  by  his  own  evidence
    continued to speak that  language  with  friends,  and  family  members
    living in the United Kingdom. Although he says that he  has  lost  some
    proficiency in it, I agree with Mr Lindsay that this is something  that
    he could remedy within a short time after arriving back in the country.

79. He is physically healthy and told me frankly that he would be able  and
    willing to undertake construction work were it available.

80. I accept that on the evidence before me there is no indication  at  all
    that the Appellant has any connection to Kabul. He has never been there
    and has no family there. Nor, on my own  findings,  does  he  have  any
    immediate family to whom he could turn in his home province.   Even  if
    he has more distant relatives  living  somewhere  in  the  country,  it
    appears doubtful, given the level of extreme  poverty  in  Afghanistan,
    that they would be willing  or  able  to  offer  financial  support  to
    someone who has just come back from the West, after the family spent  a
    considerable amount of money getting him out. That would simply be good
    money after bad.  I note in this regard that Dr  Ahmad  cites  academic
    research indicating  that  there  is  significant  stigma  attached  to
    'failed migration'.  He would however receive  �125  on  arrival  which
    would provide a short-term cushion, and Mrs  Din  acknowledged  in  her
    evidence that she would help in some way if she could.


81. Applying the country guidance I have  rejected  'westernisation'  as  a
    risk factor, but I accept that its flip side - a  lack  of  familiarity
    with Afghan culture and norms - is relevant to the 'reasonableness'  of
    internal relocation.  It is perhaps  self-evident  that  the  practical
    challenges set out above - work, food, accommodation,  creating  social
    networks - would all be  far  easier  to  navigate  for  an  individual
    familiar with those norms. Mr Lindsay placed great emphasis on the fact
    that the Appellant lived in Afghanistan until he was 12,  and  that  he
    has not been entirely divorced from Afghan culture since his arrival in
    the United Kingdom,  having  had  contact,  if  sporadic,  with  family
    members here.  The  Appellant  confesses  that  he  no  longer  regards
    himself as  a  practising  Muslim.  He  describes  his  own  lifestyle,
    behaviour and values as being 'Western'. He no longer  fasts  or  prays
    regularly - when he does it is out of respect for Mrs Din, who is  very
    traditional and devout.

82. I have taken those matters into account.  I  find  that  the  Appellant
    would not be a fish completely out of the water in Kabul. He knows  how
    to pray,  and  how  to  behave  as  if  he  is  observant.  As  he  has
    demonstrated in his behaviour under Mrs Din's roof, he is  prepared  to
    do that in order to comply with social expectations. He speaks  Pushto,
    and will, I accept, have retained  some  understanding  of  how  people
    carry themselves, and behave, in Afghan society.  That said, I consider
    it likely that it would be evident to any close observer  that  he  was
    not a native Kabuli. Experience of life as a boy in a village does  not
    necessarily equate to life as a man in the city. This will mark him out
    as different.  Dr Ahmad also  emphasises  that  the  relevance  of  the
    Appellant's decade long absence from Afghanistan is  not  just  in  how
    others perceive him, but in how he is  likely  to  feel  himself.   She
    cites research documenting how  those  returned  to  Afghanistan  after
    migrating as children experience common difficulties in "reconnecting".

83. In his statement the  Appellant  states  that  he  is  very  afraid  of
    returning to Afghanistan. Having accepted that his parents were  killed
    in the manner he describes, I have no reason to doubt that that is  the
    case.   Dr Ahmad writes that current academic  literature  has  shifted
    from previous narrow definitions of conflict  related  stressors  (such
    as, as I understand her, trauma arising from  a  particular  event)  to
    understanding the impact on mental health as a "continued process",  in
    which  stressful  social  and  material  conditions  will  continue  to
    contribute to mental distress.  As Dr Ahmad puts it, the Appellant will
    bear the "dual burden of reintegration plus war exposure".  He  further
    lives with the psychological consequences of "migratory stressors":  in
    his case such stressors have included not just the  long,  arduous  and
    dangerous journey he made as a child, but the period of insecurity  and
    instability he has experienced in the years  he  has  spent  trying  to
    regularise his position in the United Kingdom.

84. It is against this evidential background that  I  assess  Mr  Lindsay's
    submission that  the  Appellant  was  exaggerating  his  mental  health
    issues. I have already rejected the suggestion that he is feigning them
    entirely. For the reasons I set out  above  [�44]  common  sense  would
    dictate that a young child dislocated from his family and  tasked  with
    making a 6000km journey by land and sea would  likely  to  suffer  some
    psychological consequences. What  Dr  Ahmad  refers  to  as  "migratory
    stressors" must also be taken into account. Mr Lindsay's submission  is
    that the conclusions  of  Dr  Galathappie  and  Dr  Thomas  are  to  be
    contrasted with the  evidence  of  Mrs  Din  that  as  a  teenager  the
    Appellant reported that he was "in heaven" living in her home, and that
    he did not apparently seek help from  his  GP  for  any  mental  health
    concerns until approximately 2018.

85. I have given careful consideration to those submissions, and I have re-
    read the medico-legal reports before  me  in  the  context  of  the  GP
    records, and the evidence of Mrs Din.

86. The evidence of Mrs Din was - I return to this below in greater  detail
    - wholly credible and compelling. The Appellant came to live  with  Mrs
    Din and her husband in 2012. As registered foster carers he was not the
    first Afghan boy they had looked after: although  Mrs  Din  is  herself
    from East Africa, her late husband was from Peshawar and spoke  Pushto.
    They had therefore considerable experience in  looking  after  troubled
    boys, and in making them feel secure. The Appellant immediately  bonded
    with Mr and Mrs Din. He was extremely happy in their home and no doubt,
    relieved to have found some measure of security. Mrs Din describes  him
    as being "kind and content", and in her oral evidence proudly  recalled
    him telling a visiting social worker that he felt he had come  to  live
    "in heaven" in their house.  Unfortunately, Mr Din died  very  suddenly
    in 2013. Mrs Din described this as a "terrible blow"  to  her  and  the
    Appellant.  Presumably because she did not have Pushto, social services
    subsequently tried to remove the Appellant from her care - a move  that
    she and the Appellant  fiercely  resisted.  The  Appellant  desperately
    wanted to remain with her and they fought the proposed  transfer  until
    they won out.   During this period the  Appellant  had  an  outstanding
    application with the Home Office for further leave to  remain.  It  was
    when that was refused in 2015 that Mrs Din really started to notice the
    Appellant exhibiting signs of depression.  He eventually went to the GP
    in 2018 upon her insistence.


87. So, in the period closest to his childhood trauma the Appellant appears
    contented and happy, and it is only later, when faced with the prospect
    of removal from the United Kingdom, that the Appellant begins  to  show
    symptoms of depression. It is possible, as Mr  Lindsay  suggests,  that
    the visit to the GP in 2018 was part of a strategy on the part  of  the
    Appellant to create the evidence necessary to prevent  his  removal,  a
    strategy that has culminated in him giving fabricated evidence  to  Drs
    Galathappie and Thomas. It is possible. But  I  do  not  regard  it  as
    likely.   It seems to me that  there  is  nothing  remarkable  about  a
    traumatised child appearing happy because he has  found  a  secure  and
    loving home, nor in that child facing the sequalae of his trauma  later
    in life, when challenge piles upon challenge. Nor is there anything out
    of the ordinary in there being a delay between the onset  of  symptoms,
    as described by Mrs Din, and the Appellant seeking  help.   I  conclude
    that Mr Lindsay is correct to describe this evidence as  contradictory:
    in other words, it's just like real life.

88. For reasons I have already set out  above,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    conclusions reached by  Dr  Galathappie  and  Dr  Thomas  are  entirely
    consistent with the sad and troubled life history of the Appellant.  He
    has lost his parents in a brutal murder, been  trafficked  across  Asia
    and Europe, become dislocated from the few family  members  he  has  in
    this country, suffered the sudden loss of Mr Din, had to fight  removal
    from Mrs Din's home, and has ever since had the threat of removal  from
    the  United  Kingdom  hanging  over  his  head.     Both  doctors  have
    considered, and discounted,  the  possibility  that  the  Appellant  is
    feigning his reported symptoms which include recurrent and  distressing
    memories, flashbacks, fearfulness, auditory hallucination, feeling that
    the room around him is spinning, tension, feeling 'jumpy', being unable
    to eat or sleep properly. He shakes and sweats when  he  feels  anxious
    and has experienced heart palpitations. All of that is consistent  with
    what is recorded by the GP, and the Brent mental care team to whom  the
    Appellant was referred.  Mrs  Din,  the  person  best  placed  to  have
    observed the Appellant over a long period of time, has credibly told me
    about how withdrawn and listless he is, and how worried  she  is  about
    him. He is demonstrably, and visibly, suffering from mental ill health.




89. The formal conclusion of Consultant Psychiatrist Dr Galathappie,  which
    I accept, is that the Appellant is suffering  from  severe  depression,
    severe generalised anxiety disorder and PTSD.  He  requires  continuing
    medication (he is already on Mirtazapine), psychological  therapy,  and
    crucially, stability in order to recover. In Dr  Galathappie's  opinion
    the ongoing uncertainty over the Appellant's status here is  having  an
    adverse impact on his mental health, and  the  efficacy  of  treatments
    that he is being offered.  If he is permitted to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom, and continues to access treatment,  Dr  Galathappie  considers
    that the Appellant could make a meaningful recovery (although he  notes
    that the extent of the Appellant's difficulties  mean  that  this  will
    likely take several years).  Should  he  be  removed  from  the  United
    Kingdom,  and  from  his  support  networks  including  Mrs   Din,   Dr
    Galathappie writes that this will:

          "...significantly worsen his mental  health.  In  my  opinion  his
         mental health is likely to deteriorate if returned  to  Afghanistan
         and  he  is  likely  to  find   being   returned   to   Afghanistan
         traumatising.  His  depression  would  impair  his  problem-solving
         skills and lower his self-confidence. His anxiety  and  PTSD  would
         make him anxious and fearful such that he would lack the confidence
         and ability to trust others and would  therefore  not  be  able  to
         build supportive networks within Afghanistan with family, community
         members or professionals".

90. Drawing all of this together I conclude as follows. The  Tribunal  held
    in AS that it is not in general unreasonable to expect a  single  adult
    male in good health to settle in Kabul.  The Appellant is not  such  an
    individual. His life experiences thus far have left him  in  very  poor
    mental health. He is currently living with a kind and  supportive  lady
    whom he loves and trusts, but he is still very unwell. He  has  a  roof
    over his head and medical treatment for his conditions, but he is still
    very unwell.    It is perhaps self-evident - and this is  the  view  of
    both Dr Thomas and Dr  Galathappie  -  that  should  that  security  be
    removed, the Appellant's condition will significantly deteriorate.


91. What that means on the ground in Kabul is easy to  see.  The  Appellant
    will on arrival have to go to a 'chai khana' where he will be  required
    to share a dirty and unlocked room and washing facilities. His lack  of
    familiarity about life in Kabul, his nightmares and anxiety  will  mark
    him out to fellow residents. The stigma attached to mental  health,  to
    'failed migration' and the societal hostility  towards  returnees  will
    make it very hard to make friends, to build  a  network.  This  coupled
    with his terror of return, the sudden dislocation  from  Mrs  Din,  and
    from the country that he has grown  up  in,  is  likely  to  drive  the
    Appellant into a downward spiral.  He may, on a good day,  be  able  to
    find some labouring work. Mrs Din might be able to send him  a  bit  of
    cash where she can. But the reality is that the Appellant's  life  will
    be far from normal. It will in the  short  term  be  lonely,  isolated,
    deeply distressing and wretched.  In the longer  term  it  is  unlikely
    that the Appellant will be able to access any effective  treatment  for
    his mental illnesses, and I find it unlikely that he will  be  able  to
    build for himself a meaningful  private  or  family  life.  On  a  more
    practical level the Appellant knows nothing about Kabul, about  places,
    areas or people to avoid. His behaviour and  isolation  will  make  him
    easy prey to criminals.  Although I accept that the  bar  for  what  is
    'normal' in Kabul is set fairly low - insecurity, poor  sanitation  and
    unremittingly dire poverty have all been held to be quite  'reasonable'
    -  the  Appellant's  particular  characteristics  are  such  that   his
    suffering is likely to be far worse than that  endured  by  most  other
    residents of the city. Taking into account all of the  factors  I  have
    set out above, I find that it would  be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
    Appellant to avoid the violence in Nangahar by relocating to Kabul.


92. The appeal is therefore allowed on protection (humanitarian protection)
    grounds.


    Article 8

93. Given my findings above I can here be brief.


94. My starting point  is  the  Immigration  Rules.  Paragraph  276ADE  (1)
    provides that leave to remain will be granted on private  life  grounds
    where the claimant can demonstrate that one or more of four alternative
    criteria are met:

         276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the
         date of application, the applicant:


         (i) does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in Section S-
         LTR 1.1 to S-LTR 2.2. and S-LTR.3.1. to S-LTR.4.5. in Appendix FM;
         and
         (ii) has made a valid application for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life in the UK; and
         (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years
         (discounting any period of imprisonment); or
         (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the
         UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of imprisonment)
         and it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to leave the
         UK; or
         (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent at
         least half of his life living continuously in the UK (discounting
         any period of imprisonment); or
         (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or above, has
         lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years (discounting
         any period of imprisonment) but there would be very significant
         obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country to which
         he would have to go if required to leave the UK.

95. The Appellant cannot qualify under sub-paragraph (iii) because  he  has
    not lived here for 20 years.  He  has  never  been  able  to  meet  the
    requirements at (iv) because he is today over the age of 18 and reached
    that point  shortly  before  he  had  accrued  seven  years  continuous
    residence.   There is similar 'near miss' in  respect  of  (v)  because
    although the Appellant has, on a rough calculus, spent  half  his  life
    here, under the exacting terms of the rule he will not  in  fact  reach
    that point until a few weeks after  his  25th  birthday.   That  leaves
    (vi). The test of "very  significant  obstacles"  is  a  high  one.  It
    requires the claimant to demonstrate not just that he  faces  practical
    difficulties in re-establishing himself in his country  of  origin  but
    that there are there obstacles to him in time  rebuilding  the  private
    life that he has lost in the United Kingdom. For the reasons I have set
    out above, in my consideration of internal flight, I find that  on  the
    particular facts here that high test is met.  The appeal  is  therefore
    allowed on Article 8 (private life) grounds.
96. I wish to add this. Mrs Din told me that she came to  this  country  in
    the 1970s as part of the exodus of persons of South Asian descent  from
    East Africa.  She met and married her Pakistani husband and they had  a
    very happy marriage but never had children of their own. Although  they
    both worked full time - Mrs  Din  continues  to  do  so  as  a  science
    technician in a school - they decided to open their  home  to  children
    who needed it, and to take on the very challenging  task  of  providing
    those troubled young people with  support  and  stability.    Over  the
    years they  fostered  a  great  number  of  children,  including  other
    unaccompanied minors seeking protection.   In her evidence she movingly
    described how devastated she and the Appellant were at the loss of  her
    husband, and how she and the Appellant came to lean on each  other  for
    support:


         "[The Appellant] is very helpful to me around the house.  He  helps
         with the shopping, cleaning, cooking  etc.  He  has  been  my  only
         family since my husband passed away in 2013. He has been  the  only
         consistent person in my life  since  I  lost  my  husband...I  have
         family but they are busy with their  own  lives.  I  consider  [the
         Appellant] to be my immediate family member. Sometimes  people  ask
         me how I cope without my husband as I do not have  children  of  my
         own, but I always say that I have my foster children. I  have  [the
         Appellant]. Without [the Appellant] my life would be very different
         and lonely. I have meaning in my life when  he  is  around.  He  is
         there when I come home from work. He is  someone  to  talk  to,  to
         share stories with, to have dinner with. Fostering means a  lot  to
         me. My husband died of cancer, but I  have  heard  that  loneliness
         kills people more than cancer. Without  [the  Appellant],  my  life
         would be very lonely".


97. From the Appellant's  perspective  the  relationship  is  described  in
    similarly warm terms. Having explained in detail how he avoids  hurting
    her feelings by shielding her from behaviour that she might  regard  as
    'un-Islamic' the Appellant says this:


         "She is like a mother to  me.  I  call  her  'auntie'  and  I  have
         continued to live with her since 2012 even though I have become  an
         adult. She is always there for me and supports and  encourages  me.
         She knows when I am feeling down and depressed and will always help
         keep my spirits up - just like a mother would do.... My auntie  has
         provided a loving and happy home to me all these years, and I  will
         always be grateful to her. She lost her husband,  and  this  was  a
         difficult time for her, but we supported each other like a  family.
         She treats me as her son..."


98. Judge  Bennett  did  not  apparently  give  any  consideration  to  the
    possibility that what the Appellant shared with Mrs Din might be called
    'family life'. On the evidence before me I am quite satisfied that this
    is what it is. The Appellant might now be an adult but he continues  to
    live in a house with this woman who has cared for him since  he  was  a
    child, and I am wholly satisfied that they were both telling the  truth
    about their relationship.  They have both suffered  terrible  loss  but
    found support and solace in  each  other.   I  am  satisfied  that  the
    refusal to grant the Appellant any further leave, a decision  with  the
    consequence that he is required to leave the United Kingdom, will be an
    interference with that family life.


99. Whilst I am satisfied  that  the  decision  is  in  law  one  that  the
    Secretary of State is empowered to take, I must consider whether it  is
    in all the circumstances proportionate.

100. I have taken account of the public  interest  as  it  is  expressed  at
    s117B of Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

101. The maintenance of immigration control is in the  public  interest.   I
    note in this regard that the Appellant has not have leave to remain  in
    this country for a number of years, and that his status has always been
    precarious: these are matters that weigh against  him    I  also  note,
    however, that the account which I have today accepted would likely,  if
    accepted back in 2009, have resulted in the Appellant then being placed
    on a path to settlement by a grant of refugee status.

102. It is in the public interest that those  who  wish  to  settle  in  the
    United Kingdom speak English. The Appellant does speak English.

103. It is in the public interest that those  who  wish  to  settle  in  the
    United Kingdom are  financially  independent.  Although  there  was  no
    evidence before me to indicate that the  Appellant  is  in  receipt  of
    public funds, I find that he is not financially independent.   This  is
    therefore a matter that weighs against him.

104. In the context of this exercise I exclude my own findings under  276ADE
    (1)  and  acknowledge  that  the  Appellant's  private  life  has  been
    established when his status has been precarious.

105. In the Appellant's favour weighs the  following  factors.  He  came  to
    this country as a young child seeking protection.  I  am  satisfied  in
    retrospect that had his account been accepted  at  the  time,  that  he
    would have been granted refugee status, but even if I  am  wrong  about
    that, the point is that his journey here was for a lawful purpose under
    international law.   He is a former child migrant who is suffering from
    serious mental health issues, who has grown up  here  and  regards  the
    United Kingdom as his home.  The consequences for  him  of  dislocation
    from this country, and for Mrs Din, would be tragic and severe.

106. The family life that he shares with Mrs Din means  a  lot  to  both  of
    them. I accept her evidence that her life without the  Appellant  would
    be "very different and lonely" and find that she would be devastated if
    he were to leave the United Kingdom. Having  come  here  herself  as  a
    young woman (in a situation of forced migration)  Mrs  Din  has  worked
    hard to 'give back' to this country. She has been  employed  over  many
    years in a state school and told me how much she enjoys that work.  She
    has moreover done what many, if  not  all,  members  of  society  would
    regard as something incredible. She has opened her home to children  in
    the care system, children who are by definition those who  others  have
    let down, and who are left with the physical and mental trauma of those
    failures.  Although with her pleasant nature Mrs Din betrayed  none  of
    this, it cannot always have been easy. She and her  husband  must  have
    encountered  some  tough  and  challenging  situations.  Now  that  her
    fostering days are over, the legacy of that work is her warm and loving
    relationship with the Appellant, who she looks forward to  coming  home
    to at the end of the working day. After all these  years  it  does  not
    seem to me that it  can  today  be  rationally  said  that  the  public
    interest requires an interference with this family  life.    It  rather
    seems to me that society in general would wish to recognise the debt of
    gratitude that we owe to Mrs Din, (and others  like  her).   For  those
    reasons I would, in the alternative, allow this  appeal  on  Article  8
    (family life) grounds.


    Anonymity Order


107. The Appellant is entitled to protection. Having had regard to  Rule  14
    of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and   the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him.  This direction  applies
        to, amongst others, both the Appellant and the Respondent.  Failure
        to comply with this direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court
        proceedings"



    Decision and Directions


108. The appeal is dismissed on protection (Refugee Convention) grounds.


109. The appeal is allowed on protection (humanitarian protection) grounds.

110. The appeal is allowed on human rights (Article 8) grounds.

111. There is an order for anonymity.

                           'ERROR OF LAW' DECISION
                             DECISION TO ADJOURN

   1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born in  1997.  He  appeals
      with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge
      N. Minhas) to dismiss  his  appeal  on  protection  and  human  rights
      grounds.


 2. The short history of this appeal is as follows. The  Appellant  arrived
    in the United Kingdom in 2009 when he  was  12  years  old.  He  sought
    international protection and although this was refused he  was  between
    2010 and 2016 granted Discretionary Leave. As he reached adulthood  the
    Respondent decided that his circumstances had changed and  that  he  no
    longer required leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.  The  Appellant
    made a 'fresh claim' for asylum and leave on human rights grounds,  and
    following a successfully judicial review the matter  came  back  before
    the First-tier Tribunal in  the  shape  of  a  protection/human  rights
    appeal.

 3.  Before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  there  were  three  limbs  to   the
    Appellant's case:

              i) Notwithstanding the conclusions reached to the contrary  by
                 the First-tier Tribunal in 2016 (First-tier Tribunal  Judge
                 Bennett), he was entitled to protection as  a  refugee.  He
                 has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons  of  his
                 membership of a particular social group, namely a member of
                 his own family. The Appellant asserts that his parents were
                 killed in 2008 and that he would be at risk from  the  same
                 people who killed them.  In the alternative:


             ii) He could not be expected to return  to  his  home  area  of
                 Nangahar, because the  security  situation  was  such  that
                 simply by virtue of his presence there he would be at  risk
                 of indiscriminate violence. Accordingly he  submitted  that
                 Article  15(c)  of  the  Qualification   Directive[5]   was
                 engaged.   Further he submitted that protection  could  not
                 be withheld with reference to Article 8 of the QD, since it
                 would, having regard to his  personal  characteristics  and
                 the many years that he has been absent from Afghanistan, be
                 unreasonable to  expect  him  to  live  elsewhere  in  that
                 country. Further and in the alternative:


            iii) His removal from the United Kingdom today would amount to a
                 disproportionate interference with the private life that he
                 has established here in the past  twelve  years  and  so  a
                 breach of  Article  8  ECHR.  That  this  is  so  could  be
                 illustrated  inter  alia  with   reference   to   paragraph
                 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules which stipulates that he
                 should be granted leave  if  there  are  "very  significant
                 obstacles to his integration" in Afghanistan.

 4. The Tribunal found against him on all three limbs and  the  appeal  was
    dismissed.  Permission to appeal was sought and granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Gumsley on the 6th February 2020.




    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings


 5. Mark Twain famously said that it takes a long time  to  write  a  short
    letter but the same principle does not apply to grounds of appeal.   As
    became apparent at the hearing before me the  8  grounds  committed  to
    writing by Ms Fitzsimons (in pleadings as long as the decision  itself)
    were completely unnecessary and in fact boiled down to just  3  points.
    It is almost invariably the case that  errors  of  the  magnitude  that
    warrant interference by this Tribunal  can  be  stated  succinctly.  By
    contrast very lengthy argument in the  grounds  gives  the  unfortunate
    impression that there is not really any error  at  all,  and  that  the
    writer is simply disagreeing with the outcome of the appeal.


 6. As it happens that is not the case here. The decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal is flawed for error of law in respect  of  all  three  of  the
    limbs of the Appellant's claim.


    The Asylum Claim: Credibility

 7. In respect of the Appellant's asylum claim the  Judge,  and  apparently
    the Judge who preceded him in 2016[6],  draws  the  rather  astonishing
    conclusion that this protection claim can be safely  dismissed  on  the
    ground that the Appellant cannot clearly remember how long it took  him
    to walk home on a day 12 years ago, when he was 12 years old and on his
    account his parents had both just been shot dead. On  one  telling  the
    Appellant thought it had taken him 15 minutes; in another he thought it
    was 30 minutes.  I am satisfied that it  is  wholly  perverse  to  draw
    adverse inference from such a discrepancy. A great  many  12  year-olds
    would find it difficult to give an exact time for the length of a  walk
    they did last week, never mind a  decade  ago  in  extremely  traumatic
    circumstances. There is little wonder that  the  Appellant  is  unclear
    about events that day.

 8. I am also satisfied that Judge Minhas erred  in  his  approach  to  the
    evidence of a supporting witness, the Appellant's cousin. At  paragraph
    17 of the decision the Judge says:


         "I place little weight on the evidence of the  Appellant's  cousin,
         he was already in the United Kingdom at the time of the Appellant's
         parents' alleged killing and cannot provide reliable evidence as to
         how the Appellant's parents died or who killed them".


    I am satisfied that this reasoning is flawed for two reasons: a failure
    of logic and a failure to take material evidence into account. It is no
    doubt correct to say that this man could not say  who  had  killed  his
    uncle and aunt, but that was not  why  he  was  being  called:  he  was
    obviously able to speak to his belief that his uncle and  aunt  had  in
    fact been killed in Nangahar in 2008 and absent  any  reason  to  doubt
    that it was his genuinely held belief that they had, that was  evidence
    which lent support to the Appellant's claim.

 9. It follows that I need not dwell  on  the  complaint  articulated  over
    another 14 paragraphs of the grounds, namely that in its assessment the
    Tribunal failed to have regard to the expert evidence of two additional
    witnesses. The first was a  doctor  who  opined  that  the  Appellant's
    memory of these  events  would  be  hazy.  The  second  was  a  country
    background specialist who points out that an uneducated Afghan child is
    unlikely to have a firm grasp of dates, and that in view  of  the  fact
    that Nangahar was at all material  times  in  the  grip  of  a  Taliban
    insurgency which cost the lives of many civilians,  there  was  nothing
    implausible in the  account  given.   I  intend  no  criticism  of  the
    Appellant's representatives, who have obviously  prepared  this  appeal
    with great diligence and have sought to ensure that  the  Tribunal  had
    before it the best  evidence  possible,   and  I  certainly  intend  no
    respect to the experts concerned, but this evidence  simply  served  to
    confirm what should have been obvious to any reasonable decision maker.
       It is with that in mind that I accept that it was an  error  of  law
    for the First-tier Tribunal to fail to weigh these  expert  reports  in
    the balance when  assessing  the  credibility  of  the  claim,  and  in
    particular, applying the Devaseelan principles[7],  whether  there  was
    reason to depart from the findings of Judge Bennett.


10. Mr McVeety submitted that notwithstanding any error in the approach  to
    credibility a real risk could not, after so long, be made out: even  if
    the historical  narrative  is  accepted  the  Appellant  is  unable  to
    articulate who he is afraid of  and  why.  In  the  final  analysis  Mr
    McVeety's  submission  may  be  proved  correct.  It  is  however   not
    satisfactory for a risk assessment to be built  on  shaky  foundations,
    and even if a current risk is not proven, the question of what happened
    to this Appellant's family remains relevant to the question of internal
    relocation, to which I now turn.


    Humanitarian Protection: Internal Flight


11. The First-tier Tribunal  accepted  that  the  Appellant  could  not  be
    returned to Nangahar because  there  exists  there  an  internal  armed
    conflict such  that  he  would  face  a  real  risk  of  indiscriminate
    violence. Although the Presenting Officer did not concede  that  to  be
    so, the First-tier Tribunal properly had  regard  to  the  Respondent's
    published policy which made  that  very  concession:  Afghanistan  CPIN
    Security and Humanitarian Situation July 2019.  Before  me  Mr  McVeety
    agreed that this was the Respondent's position.


12. The only matter left to  be  determined,  therefore,  was  whether  the
    Appellant could reasonably be expected to relocate within Afghanistan.

13. Mr McVeety accepted that the Tribunal did not expressly  direct  itself
    to consider either of the acceptable  formulations  -  'reasonable'  or
    'unduly harsh' -  to be applied in this context: Ms  Fitzsimons'  first
    complaint.  He further accepted her second, namely that the  Tribunal's
    conclusion that the Appellant would not be at risk of serious  harm  in
    Kabul could not be determinative of the issue of internal  flight.   It
    is also right to say, as articulated under the  heading  of  ground  1,
    that the Tribunal appeared to view the Appellant's mental health issues
    exclusively through the prism of Article 3 when  that  was  beside  the
    point.   All of these  arguments  are  made  out.  In  the  context  of
    internal flight  claimants are under no obligation to  show  that  they
    would suffer serious harm in the area of relocation.  The  question  is
    whether in all the circumstances, it is reasonable to  expect  them  to
    live there. The Tribunal  failed  to  ask  itself  that  question,  and
    perhaps for that reason failed  to  take  all  relevant  evidence  into
    account. That evidence included the extensive medical  opinion  offered
    on the Appellant's precarious mental health. In this country  he  feels
    stable, safe and supported. He has mental health professionals to  whom
    he can turn; family members and indeed his former  foster  carer  rally
    around him.  He has a private life in the true sense of the term  under
    the Convention: he enjoys meaningful  relationships  with  other  human
    beings.  In Kabul, it is submitted, he will have none of that.  He may,
    as the First-tier Tribunal finds, be able to eat, and (even  though  he
    has absolutely no life experience  of  value  in  that  country)  could
    conceivably hustle his way into receiving some form  of  mental  health
    support, but those matters are not the only relevant considerations. It
    was incumbent on the Tribunal to consider whether there was a real risk
    that this very vulnerable young  man  would  not  be  able  to  lead  a
    "relatively normal life" if returned to Kabul. That it did not do,  and
    so its reasoning on internal flight must  be  set  aside  for,  amongst
    other things,  misdirection.


    Private Life: Very Significant Obstacles


14. As I have already alluded to at my �12 above, in this  case  there  was
    considerable  overlap  between  the  Article  8  considerations   under
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules and the internal flight  analysis.
    As above, I am satisfied that in its  assessment  of  this  matter  the
    Tribunal erred.  I further find that in its assessment of private  life
    'outside of the rules' the Tribunal manifestly failed to  have  regard,
    at all, to the 11 years that the Appellant has spent in  this  country.
    Its consideration of this  aspect  of  the  claim  is  confined  to  an
    iteration of the public interest as  expressed  at  s117B  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   That was an important  part  of  its
    assessment,  but  to  only  weigh  one  side  of  the  scale   in   the
    proportionality balancing exercise was a serious error.




    Anonymity Order


15. The Appellant seeks international protection. Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"



    Decision and Directions


16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for material error of
    law and it is set aside.


17. The decision in the appeal will be remade following a  further  hearing
    in the Upper Tribunal.


18. There is an order for anonymity.

[2] I note that in her 96 paragraph 'skeleton' argument Ms Fitzsimons has,
in addition to the matters addressed in this decision, submitted that the
Appellant has a discrete Article 3 claim based on a risk of suicide.
Although that skeleton is dated the 11th December 2019, and has therefore
been taken over by events, I was asked to take its contents into account.
Given that neither party made any submissions on such an Article 3 claim I
have assumed that it is no longer pursued and have not addressed it in this
decision.
[3] Mr Tim Foxley MBE has prepared two reports for the purposes of this
appeal. He is a political and military expert who has specialised on
Afghanistan for twenty years. He served in the British Army in Afghanistan
and has latterly been employed by the Ministry of Defence.  His expertise
is accepted by this Tribunal, and uncontested by the Secretary of State.
