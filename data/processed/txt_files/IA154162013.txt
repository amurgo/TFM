Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Ndubuisi, Drummond Miller LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal with permission against a  decision  by  Judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal J C Grant-Hutchison dismissing the appeal  under  the
   Immigration Rules and under Article 8.  In a decision dated 23 April 2013
   the respondent refused the appellant leave to  remain  as  a  partner  of
   Coralle Walker McDonald.  The judge found that the appellant and  sponsor
   had a joint income below the �18,600  threshold  under  Appendix  FM  and
   therefore could not meet the maintenance requirement.  The appellant  did
   not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules.
   Accordingly the judge went on to consider the appeal under Article 8  and
   found the refusal decision was not disproportionate.

2) The judge  found  that  a  removal  decision  under  section  47  of  the
   Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 was unlawful  but  this  did
   not affect the substantive decision.

3) Permission to appeal was granted on  several  grounds.   The  application
   giving rise to the refusal decision was made in January  2012  and  there
   was a question as to whether the rules introduced  in  July  2012  should
   have been applied.  There was also a question as to the judge's reasoning
   under Article 8.

4) The first question which arose at the hearing before me was  whether  the
   application should have been considered under the pre-July 2012 Rules  or
   the new Rules.  Mr Ndubuisi explained that the application was  submitted
   in January 2012 under the rule then in force, which was  paragraph  295D.
   For the respondent, however, Mr Matthews  indicated  that  the  appellant
   could not have succeeded  under  the  old  paragraph  295D  because  this
   required that an applicant already had leave under the Immigration  Rules
   whereas the only leave the appellant had at time of his  application  was
   discretionary leave  outwith  the  Rules.   The  appellant  had  obtained
   discretionary leave at a time when he was pursuing contact proceedings in
   the Sheriff Court but he had not been awarded contact  so  it  would  not
   have been appropriate for his discretionary leave to have been  extended.
   It was therefore proper to have considered the application under Appendix
   FM.

5) Mr Ndubuisi pointed out that the respondent had requested documents  from
   the appellant in October 2012 in order to see whether the  appellant  met
   the financial requirements of Appendix FM.  The appellant  provided  this
   documentation for a 12 month period but the respondent then excluded part
   of this period in making the calculation  of  the  couple's  income.   Mr
   Ndubuisi said that the relevant requirement of the rules was to be  found
   at Appendix FM-SE, paragraph 2(c)(ii), which stated that wage slips  must
   be provided covering any period of salaried employment in the  period  of
   12 months prior to the date of the application if the applicant has  been
   employed by their current employer for less than 6 months.

6) Mr Ndubuisi continued that this still left a question over  the  date  of
   the application.  This was in  January  2012  and  Appendix  FM  was  not
   retrospective.  If, however, Appendix FM was applied, then  the  relevant
   time for consideration was the date when  the  respondent  requested  the
   documents.

7) In addition, Mr Ndubuisi submitted  that  it  was  not  reasonable  under
   Article 8 to expect the appellant to leave the  UK  to  apply  for  entry
   clearance and the judge took the wrong approach on this  issue.   Whether
   or not the parties had an intention to marry was not a  relevant  factor,
   although the judge appeared to have taken this into  account.   Reference
   was made to the cases of Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 and Zhang  [2013]  EWHC
   891 (Admin).

8) For the respondent Mr Matthew submitted that if was  the  rules  enforced
   at the date of decision which had  to  be  applied,  in  accordance  with
   Odelola [2009] UKHL 25, subject  to  any  transitional  provisions.   The
   cases of Zhang and Chikwamba did not assist the appellant.   The  outcome
   of the appeal depended upon the  application  of  Appendix  FM.   If  the
   appellant failed under the financial requirements on  the  basis  of  the
   evidence then he would fail on the financial requirements if  he  applied
   for entry clearance from Pakistan.  The rule required an annual income of
   �18,600.  The judge found that the couple had an income of about �15,000.
    The appellant was self-employed at the time.  His earnings over a period
   of 3 months were enough to raise the couple's  income  over  �18,600  but
   this was not an annual income.  Their annual income  was  still  �15,000.
   The relevant provisions to be followed  were  paragraphs  18  and  19  of
   Appendix FM-SE.  On the application of MM [2013] EWHC  1900  (Admin),  Mr
   Matthews relied on Gulshan (Article 8 - new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
   [2013] UKUT 640.

9) Mr Matthews continued that the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
   entitled to assess the strength and  quality  of  the  relationship  when
   considering  proportionality  under  Article  8.   The  judge  considered
   whether it was reasonable to expect the couple to relocate  to  Pakistan.
   That might have been an  error  but  the  error  was  in  favour  of  the
   appellant.  There was no error of law such that the  decision  should  be
   set aside and remade.

10) For the appellant, Mr Ndubuisi submitted  that  the  respondent  had  no
   issue with  the  relationship  between  the  couple  although  the  judge
   questioned the relationship in her determination.  The  couple  had  been
   cohabiting from 2010 until 2014.  The judge appeared to have been looking
   for the couple's intention to marry but she should have been  looking  at
   the period of cohabitation.  The question of  marriage  should  not  have
   been an issue at all.  The decision should be re-made in  favour  of  the
   appellant.  The question  of  whether  a  further  hearing  was  required
   depended on the application of Appendix  FM.   If  the  evidence  of  the
   appellant's  self-employed  income  was  taken  into  account  then   the
   financial requirements were met.

11) In relation  to  the  determination  by  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal I have two concerns about  what  is  otherwise  a  thorough  and
   carefully written determination.  The first concern relates to the period
   of time in respect of  which  the  couple's  earnings  should  have  been
   assessed.  The second relates to the judge's  approach  to  the  couple's
   relationship when considering the application of Article 8.

12) In relation to the question of dates, the background to the  application
   is important.  The application was made in January 2012, before  the  new
   Rules, which include Appendix FM, came into force on 9  July  2012.    In
   theory, therefore, the application fell to be considered  under  the  old
   rules and, in particular, paragraph 295D.  As Mr  Matthews  pointed  out,
   however, the appellant could not succeed under paragraph 295D because  he
   did not have leave under the Immigration Rules at the time  he  made  his
   application.  He had  discretionary  leave  outwith  the  Rules  for  the
   purpose of pursuing contact proceedings in respect of his  child  of  his
   previous marriage.  The appellant therefore could not succeed  under  the
   old Rules.

13) By the time the respondent came to  consider  the  application  the  new
   Rules were in force.  The application could  not  succeed  as  originally
   made but only under Article 8 in respect  of  the  appellant's  right  to
   respect for his private or family life.  When considering an  application
   under Article 8 the respondent  will  apply  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
   276ADE because these are intended to provide for consideration of  issues
   relating to private and family  life.   Accordingly  the  respondent  was
   entitled to proceed  under  Appendix  FM,  not  on  the  basis  that  the
   application as originally made fell under Appendix FM, but on  the  basis
   that the appellant was claiming a right to remain in the UK on the  basis
   of private and family life.

14) Nevertheless,  the  financial  assessment  required  under  Appendix  FM
   contains a provision which causes some considerable  difficulty.   As  Mr
   Ndubuisi pointed out, paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE, which sets  out  the
   evidence of financial requirements which must be provided, refers to wage
   slips being provided for periods prior to the date  of  the  application.
   In respect of this  particular  application,  however,  it  was  made  in
   January 2012, before Appendix FM came into force.   Similarly,  paragraph
   12A, which appears to be directly applicable to this application were  it
   made under Appendix FM, again refers to wage slips  for  a  period  of  6
   months prior to the date of application.

15) In considering the application under Appendix FM the respondent  appears
   to have taken a pragmatic approach in writing  to  the  appellant  on  26
   September  2012  (pages  193-194  of  the  appellant's  first  Inventory)
   requesting financial documents from the appellant and his  partner.   The
   appellant's position, which the judge set out  at  paragraph  17  of  her
   determination, was that between September 2011  and  September  2012  the
   appellant's partner earned  approximately  �15,100  per  annum.   In  the
   period from February to April 2012 the appellant himself  earned  �4,500.
   These two sums together made a joint income of approximately �19,600  for
   the period September 2011 to September 2012.

16) In making  a  financial  assessment  under  Appendix  FM,  however,  the
   respondent took the P60s for the appellant and his partner for  the  year
   ending 5 April 2012 and found a combined annual income  of  �18,  441.14.
   This included the appellant's earnings for  the  month  of  February  and
   March but not for the month of April, hence the shortfall.

17) To  summarise,  at  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
   respective  positions  of  the  parties  in  respect  of  the   financial
   requirements were as follows.   The  appellant  sought  to  rely  on  his
   partner's earning for the year up to September 2012 and his own  earnings
   for the 3 months from  February  to  April  2012.   If  the  year  up  to
   September  2012  was  taken  as  the  period  over  which  earnings  were
   calculated then the appellant  and  his  partner  satisfied  the  minimum
   income threshold of �18,600.  The respondent sought to take the  couple's
   earnings for the tax  year  ending  5  April  2012,  which  excluded  the
   appellant's earnings for April 2012, and therefore  produced  a  combined
   income of just below the threshold of �18,600.  The Judge of  the  First-
   tier Tribunal pointed out, however, at paragraph 18 of the determination,
   that Appendix FM-SE generally  requires  that  financial  information  is
   taken into account from a period of 6 months prior to  the  date  of  the
   application.  In other words, neither the appellant's  approach  nor  the
   respondent's  approach  complied  with  the  evidential  requirements  of
   Appendix FM-SE.

18) Having pointed out this anomaly, the Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   did not pursue it.  Instead she had regard to the couple's earnings up to
   the date of the hearing, including the  appellant's  evidence  about  his
   anticipated earnings from self employment.   The  judge  found  that  the
   couple's income was below the �18,600 threshold apart  from  during  a  3
   month period from February to April 2012.

19) In making this finding the judge fell into error.   There  was  no  more
   justification for the judge to consider the couple's  income  up  to  the
   date of the hearing than there was for the Secretary of State to consider
   the income for the tax year up  to  5  April  2012.   Both  periods  were
   outwith the scope of Appendix FM-SE.

20) It might be argued that the alternative period would  have  been  the  6
   months prior to the application in January 2012.  However, the difficulty
   with this proposal, as Mr Ndubuisi pointed out, is that  Appendix  FM  is
   not  retrospective.   The  application  of  January  2012  preceded   the
   introduction of Appendix FM.  There is no basis in  Appendix  FM  or  its
   transitional provisions which would permit an application made in January
   2012 to be considered as if it were made on or after 9 July 2012.   There
   the matter appears to rest.

21) Accordingly, as far as the application under the  Immigration  Rules  is
   concerned, the application falls between two stools.  It  cannot  succeed
   under paragraph 295D for the reasons already set out  above.   It  cannot
   succeed under Appendix FM because the financial requirements in  Appendix
   FM do not provide a mechanism for calculating  the  income  of  a  couple
   whose application was made prior to 9 July 2012.   Accordingly  it  would
   seem the application cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules.

22) Quite rightly the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal went on consider  the
   appeal under Article 8 outwith the Rules.  Once again, her  consideration
   is thorough but, as I have already indicated, her reasoning  includes  an
   irrelevant consideration.  The judge records at  paragraph  35  that  the
   couple met four years ago and have been in  a  relationship  since  then.
   The judge then comments that the couple are not married or engaged.   She
   states they have what she regards  as  vague  plans  for  the  future  of
   marrying and settling down and having their own family.  The  judge  then
   records that she had only their own evidence  that  they  met  some  four
   years ago and have been in a relationship since, although this was  never
   questioned up until this point.

23) Mr Matthews submitted that the judge was entitled to assess the  quality
   of the relationship in her consideration of  Article  8.   As  a  general
   proposition this is correct but I have two difficulties with the  judge's
   approach.  The first is that she has questioned the relationship for  the
   first time in her determination and the couple had no notice that it  was
   to  be  questioned.   The  second  issue  is  that  when  assessing   the
   relationship of an unmarried couple there is  no  requirement  that  they
   should intend to marry or have plans  to  marry  in  the  future.   I  am
   satisfied that the judge's reasoning in respect  of  Article  8  contains
   errors of law and for this reason her decision must be set aside.

24) Mr Matthew submitted that the principle of Chikwamba  would  not  assist
   the appellant as if he returned to Pakistan he would still be  unable  to
   meet the relevant financial requirements in  Appendix  FM.   I  consider,
   however, that this submission requires to be qualified in two ways.   The
   first arises from what the Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  stated  at
   paragraph 39 of her determination where she pointed out that the  sponsor
   had increased her income previously and could do so again  to  raise  her
   above the �18,600 threshold.  In other words, the sponsor's income is not
   fixed  were  an  application  be  made  in  the   future.    The   second
   qualification relates to the past.  The application was  not  made  under
   Appendix FM but was made under the old Immigration Rules before  Appendix
   FM came into force.  As already pointed out, the provisions  of  Appendix
   FM-SE do not provide a clear mechanism for calculating  income  where  an
   application  was  made  before  9th  July  2012.   Furthermore,  in   the
   circumstances of this appeal the  question  of  the  adequacy  of  income
   depends to a large extent on the period taken for assessment.

25) As is clear from  Zhang,  the  Chikwamba  principle  still  applies,  in
   particular, in respect of applications made  before  9  July  2012.   The
   basic question, as put succinctly in  Hayat  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1054,  is
   whether there is a sensible reason to require the appellant to return  to
   Pakistan to apply for entry clearance.  If there is not then it will be a
   disproportionate interference with family life to require him to do this.
    Mr Matthews' answer to this question would be that the reason is for the
   appellant to demonstrate that the requirements of Appendix  FM  are  met,
   particularly the financial requirements.  To  this  the  appellant  might
   respond that these financial requirements were not in force at  the  time
   the application was made.  More significantly in my view,  the  financial
   requirements in Appendix FM provide no mechanism for  assessing  evidence
   of financial requirements where an application was made prior to  9  July
   2012 and, on one assessment, the requirements were indeed met.  In  other
   words, why should the appellant be expected  to  return  to  Pakistan  to
   provide evidence of financial requirements which was not necessary at the
   time he originally made his  application  and  which,  depending  on  the
   period of assessment, was satisfied anyway?

26) There  is,  of  course,  a  public  interest  in  maintaining  effective
   immigration control and this must be  balanced  against  the  appellant's
   right to private and family life.  The chief stumbling  block  preventing
   the appellant from succeeding under Appendix FM was  the  �18,600  income
   threshold.   Depending  on  the  period  taken  for  calculating  income,
   however,  the  appellant  either  satisfied  or  did  not  satisfy   this
   requirement.  If the period taken by the respondent up to  5  April  2012
   was used, then the appellant  fell  slightly  short  but  if  the  period
   preferred by the appellant, for the year up to September 2012 was  taken,
   then he met the requirement.  Neither of these periods is contemplated by
   the terms of Appendix FM-SE because neither of them falls  prior  to  the
   date of the application.  There is no good reason  for  choosing  one  of
   these periods rather than the other.   Both  are  outwith  the  terms  of
   Appendix FM but one favours the appellant and the  other  does  not.   In
   these circumstances it is difficult to see how  the  public  interest  in
   maintaining immigration control is to be served  when  by  a  calculation
   under one period the appellant meets the  threshold  and  by  calculation
   under another period he does not, but neither period is  contemplated  by
   the Rules.

27) In these circumstances I am satisfied that to require the  appellant  to
   return to Pakistan to make an application for entry clearance would be  a
   disproportionate interference with his right to respect for  private  and
   family life.  Accordingly, the appeal will succeed under Article 8.

28) The comments by the Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of
   section 47 are correct in law but as the appeal falls to be allowed under
   Article 8 the removal decision will fall away.

29) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  made  no  fee  award  because  the
   appeal was dismissed.  In allowing the appeal I have to consider  whether
   a fee award should be made.  In  the  circumstances  of  this  appeal  it
   cannot be said that there was  clear  evidence  available  prior  to  the
   respondent's decision  on  which  the  application  ought  to  have  been
   granted.  Accordingly I make no fee award.

Conclusions

30) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve  the
   making of an error on a point of law.

31) I set aside the decision.

32) I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it under Article 8.

Anonymity

33) The First-tier Tribunal did not make a direction  for  anonymity  and  I
   consider that no order requires to be made.

Fee Award            Note: This is not part of the determination

In the light of my decision  to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered whether to make  a  fee  award  and  for  the
reasons set out above I make no fee award.
