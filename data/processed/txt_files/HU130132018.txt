Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Ahmed of Counsel instructed by Courtney Smith
Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer






                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal against the decision of first-tier Tribunal  Judge
       Jones QC, promulgated on 2 May 2019 in which he dismissed the appeal
       of Miss Limbu, an adult dependant of a former Gurkha.



    2. For the purposes of this decision, we shall hereinafter refer to the
       Secretary  of  State  as  the  respondent  and  Miss  Limbu  as  the
       appellant, reflecting their positions as they  were  in  the  appeal
       before the First-tier Tribunal.


    3. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal who  made  her  application  for
       settlement when she was 31 years of age on the basis that she is the
       daughter of an ex-Gurkha soldier now  present  and  settled  in  the
       United Kingdom.


    4. The entry clearance officer refused the application and that refusal
       was maintained by the entry clearance manager on 11 April 2018.


    5. The appellant appealed against that decision under section 82 of the
       Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on the grounds  set  out
       in section 84, an Article 8 appeal. Her appeal was heard on 30 April
       2019 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Jones QC.  Before  the  first-tier
       Tribunal the appellant's father gave oral evidence.   The  appellant
       also provided a witness statement.


    6. The judge found that the appellant was 32 years of age  but  at  the
       time Annex K of the  Immigration  Rules  was  amended  to  apply  to
       children of ex Gurkha soldiers under 31, she was only 28.  He  found
       that the appellant's father had been discharged  from  the  army  in
       August 1985 and "chose to settle"  in  this  country  in  July  2011
       having been granted settlement in May 2011.  The  judge  also  found
       that the appellant resided in the family home in  Nepal  but  stated
       that to the  extent  that  she  lived  there  rent  free,  then  the
       provision of that accommodation contributed to her  maintenance  but
       did not make her financially dependent on her father. He found  that
       from around October 2015 the appellant's father  began  sending  her
       remittances in varying amounts.


    7. The judge did not accept the evidence of the appellant's father that
       he would have settled in the UK with his then family forthwith  upon
       his discharge from the army if able to do so.  The  judge  took  the
       view that the appellant's father was prepared to give  "evidence  of
       convenience"  designed  to  procure  the  outcome  desired  by   the
       appellant. The judge stated that the appellant's father  was  not  a
       "careful or reliable witness". He did not accept his  evidence  that
       the appellant had never lived separately from him, at least not  for
       more than two years.


    8. Although the judge accepted that the appellant resided in the family
       home, the judge concluded that he did not consider it  to  be  "more
       probable than not" that the appellant was financially dependent upon
       her mother and/or father. The judge said that  the  amounts  of  the
       remittances were in "modest amounts" which in his judgement would be
       inadequate to provide for the appellant's maintenance even  allowing
       for a very much lower cost of living in Nepal. He said that he could
       not "give credence" to the implied assertion that �100  -  �200  per
       calendar month  was  sufficient  for  the  appellant's  maintenance.
       Further he stated that the family home "like all family homes around
       the world" was likely to  need  "routine  repairs  and  maintenance"
       which would need to be funded by remittances  from  the  appellant's
       father.


    9. The judge did not accept  the  evidence  "to  the  effect  that  the
       appellant does nothing on a day-to-day basis  in  Nepal  other  than
       undertake studies relating to care work". The judge stated that  the
       appellant did not say why she did not work, whether she applied  for
       jobs and whether she earns money from any kind  of  self-employment.
       He said, "she does not explain how a  fit  and  healthy  32-year-old
       woman, in the prime of life, spends her time, day by day."


   10. The judge found that the appellant was not "in any meaningful sense"
       emotionally dependent upon her father. He said  that  the  emotional
       dependency asserted by her father and the appellant was an "entirely
       self-serving assertion, detached from reality".


   11. The judge said that he kept in mind the judgment  of  the  Court  of
       Appeal in Rai v ECO (New Delhi) [2017] EWCA Civ 320 and the ultimate
       question of whether family life within  the  meaning  of  Article  8
       exists is to be tested against a careful consideration  of  all  the
       relevant facts.


   12. The judge held that the telephone contact between the appellant  and
       her parents was part  of  family  life  but  did  not  lead  to  the
       conclusion that there  was  family  life  sufficient  to  cross  the
       relevant threshold. In relation to the visits on three occasions  by
       the appellant's father,  the  judge  held  that  this  was  "equally
       commonplace" and insufficient to justify a finding  of  family  life
       within the meaning of Article 8.


   13.  Finally  the  judge  concluded  that  even  if  the  appellant  had
       established that there was family life, her appeal would still  have
       failed. He  referred  to  the  decision  in  Ghising  (Gurkhas/BOCs:
       historic wrong: weight) [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC) but stated that that
       decision was made prior to the 2015 amendment to annex K. The  judge
       said: "it is that  Annex  that  now  sets  out  this  country's  and
       government's policy which has been specifically designed... to  meet
       the perceived historic wrong. It may well be that there  will  still
       be factual circumstances in which weight should be attached  to  the
       perceived historic wrong even  where  an  appellant  does  not  come
       within the policy  specifically  designed  to  meet  that  perceived
       historic wrong.... However in the instant appeal I can  perceive  of
       no injustice to the  appellant,  whether  historical  or  otherwise,
       given that (sic) my finding set out  in  paragraph  15  (vii)  above
       [that he did not accept the appellant's father's assertion  that  he
       would have settled in the UK with his then family forthwith upon the
       discharge from the army if able to do so.]"


   14. Permission to appeal was sought on the grounds that  (i)  there  was
       actual or apparent bias on  the  part  of  the  first-tier  Tribunal
       Judge; (ii) the judge  misdirected  himself  as  to  the  principles
       governing the assessment of the existence of family life; (iii)  the
       judge erred in his approach to proportionality under  article  8  by
       failing to attach any or any adequate weight to historical injustice
       caused to Gurkhas  and  their  families  and  failed  to  apply  the
       principles set out in Gurung [2013] EWCA Civ 8 at [40] to  [42]  and
       Ghising (Gurkhas/BOCs: historic wrong:  weight)  [2013]  UKUT  00567
       (IAC).


   15. Permission to appeal was granted on 22  October  2019.  In  granting
       permission for  the  appeal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Stephen  Smith
       stated, amongst other things, that it was arguable  that  the  judge
       erred when assessing whether family life existed for the purposes of
       Article 8. The judge said that there was  "no  evidence"  concerning
       various planks of the appellant's case whereas there was evidence in
       the appellant's witness statement and the  sponsor's  oral  evidence
       given at the hearing. If the judge meant  that  there  was  no  oral
       evidence that he  accepted  or  documentary  evidence,  arguably  he
       should have explained why. The judge's dismissal of the unchallenged
       financial evidence was arguably based on his speculation  concerning
       the cost of living in Nepal. Upper Tribunal  Judge  Smith  therefore
       concluded that it was arguable that by  failing  to  articulate  the
       specific issues which lay at the heart of the operative reasons  for
       dismissing the appeal, the judge failed to give  sufficient  reasons
       for reaching his findings.


   16. Before this tribunal the ground  of  apparent/actual  bias  was  not
       pursued in oral  submissions.  Instead  counsel  for  the  appellant
       focused on the failure to engage with the evidence as to whether  or
       not there was family life and the approach to proportionality.


   17. It was submitted for the appellant that no questions were put to the
       appellant's father  in  relation  to  matters  on  which  the  judge
       subsequently made adverse  findings.  In  relation  to  the  judge's
       findings in relation to remittances it was submitted that the  judge
       referred only to remittances being sent from  October  2015  whereas
       the evidence of the appellant's father in his witness statement  was
       that he started sending monies to the  appellant  immediately  after
       her return to  Nepal  (in  January  2014).  It  was  submitted  that
       therefore  the  judge's  conclusion  that   the   remittances   were
       inadequate was not based on the totality of  the  evidence.  It  was
       further submitted that the conclusion on the need for maintenance of
       the family home was entirely speculative.


   18. It was submitted that the judge was wrong to reject the evidence  of
       the appellant's father on  the  basis  that  he  asserted  that  his
       daughter had never lived separately from him, at least not for  more
       than two years in the light of the evidence in the father's  witness
       statement.


   19. It was submitted that it was clear from the  record  of  proceedings
       that no questions had been asked by the judge as to whether  or  not
       the appellant was in fact working.


   20. Finally it was submitted that the judge's finding that she  was  not
       emotionally dependent did not deal with the evidence  that  she  was
       the only child in  the  family  who  remained  in  Nepal  the  other
       (surviving) children being in Australia, serving in the British Army
       and in the UK.


   21. As to the conclusion on proportionality, it was  submitted  for  the
       appellant that the conclusion was wrong and  demonstrated  that  the
       judge had failed to grasp the principles to  be  applied  in  Gurkha
       cases.


   22. For the respondent it was submitted that the appellant had not shown
       evidence of her needs and outgoings and that  it  was  open  to  the
       judge to conclude that the amount which was being sent by her father
       was not sufficient. Further it was submitted that the fact that  the
       appellant had studied in the UK in 2010 demonstrated that she wished
       to be  independent.  It  was  submitted  that  the  visits  did  not
       establish family life and the onus was on the appellant to show that
       the requirements were met.


   23. In relation to proportionality, it was accepted for  the  respondent
       that if family life was  found,  then  it  needed  something  "quite
       extraordinary" to take away from  the  historic  injustice.  It  was
       accepted that the judge's approach to the Article 8  proportionality
       assessment was not sustainable and that it would need something like
       a criminal conviction to outweigh the factors bearing in  favour  of
       granting leave in Gurkha cases.


   24. The approach to  relationships  between  adult  children  and  their
       parents has been considered  in  a  line  of  cases  beginning  with
       Kugathas v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2003]  EWCA
       Civ 31 and which include Singh & Anor v Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  630,  PT  (Sri  Lanka)  v  Entry
       Clearance Officer, Chennai [2016] EWCA Civ 612 , Butt v Secretary of
       State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 184 , and Rai v  Entry
       Clearance Officer, New Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320.



   25.   The courts have given  guidance  on  assessing  the  existence  of
       family life where the separation of the parties has been exacerbated
       by a "historic injustice".




   26. In Patel [2010] EWCA Civ 17, Sedley LJ stated at [14] that "what may
       constitute  an  extant  family  life  falls  well  short   of   what
       constitutes dependency, and a good many adult children ... may still
       have a family life with parents who are  now  settled  here  not  by
       leave or by force of circumstance but by long-delayed right".




   27.  In Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320 at [36]-[37] Lindblom LJ found that  the
       Upper Tribunal had erred in law in assessing the existence of family
       life by "looking not just for a sufficient degree of  financial  and
       emotional dependence to constitute family life, but  also  for  some
       extraordinary, or exceptional, feature in the appellant's dependence
       upon his parents as a necessary determinant of the existence of  his
       family life with them."




   28. " In the case of adults, in  the  context  of  immigration  control,
       there is no legal or factual presumption  as  to  the  existence  or
       absence of family life for the purposes  of  Article  8....  It  all
       depends on the facts." ( see Singh, at [24]).




   29. It is clear from paragraph 17 of Rai which references Kugathas  that
       if dependency is read down as  meaning  "support"  in  the  personal
       sense and if one added echoing Strasbourg's jurisprudence "real"  or
       "committed" or "effective" to the word "support" then it  represents
       the irreducible minimum of what family life  implies.  Therefore  in
       determining the nature and quality of the relationship  between  the
       appellant and the sponsor the FtTJ was  required  to  asked  himself
       whether the sponsor provided her with "support" which was "real"  or
       "committed" or "effective" (see, for example, paragraph 36  of  Rai)
       and whether there were further elements of dependency involving more
       than the normal emotional ties.


   30. At paragraph 16 of the judgement, the first-tier Tribunal  correctly
       noted that the question of whether  family  life  exists  is  to  be
       tested against  a  careful  consideration  of  the  relevant  facts.
       However the judge appears to have started from the proposition  that
       she was "a woman in the  prime  of  life  who,  absent  debilitating
       physical or mental deficits, would  ordinarily  be  expected  to  be
       living a meaningful independent  life."  Having  started  from  that
       position he then  rejected  the  evidence  that  the  appellant  was
       financially and/or emotionally dependent upon her parents.


   31. The unchallenged evidence was that the sponsor  had  provided  money
       remittances to the appellant from 2015. The judge  referred  to  the
       remittances as "quite  inadequate.".  This  was  based  on  his  two
       assertions; firstly, that  even  allowing  for  the  lower  cost  of
       living, the sums of �100-�200 were insufficient for the  appellant's
       maintenance needs in Nepal and secondly, further sums of money  were
       required for repairs and maintenance on the family home.



   32. We are satisfied that there was no evidential foundation for  either
       of those findings on the evidence before the judge and were  in  our
       view wholly speculative.




   33. In addition, in his assessment of the " adequacy" of the maintenance
       provided, the judge failed to take account of other evidence  before
       him set out in the witness statement of the  sponsor  (at  paragraph
       [16]) which made reference to other  amounts  of  financial  support
       sent through the traditional transfer system of HUNDI and that  sums
       were also sent via family and friends who were visiting Nepal.




   34. He also left  out  of  his  consideration  other  relevant  evidence
       capable of supporting the claimed " family life" which was that  she
       has no family in  Nepal,   she  is  living  in  a  house  rent  free
       supported by her father and she is unmarried and not working. If the
       judge did not accept that evidence, it was incumbent on the judge to
       set out his reasoning.


   35. The  second  error  relates  to  the  FtTJ's  consideration  of  the
       sponsor's evidence relevant to the issue  of  "historic  injustice".
       Under the policy the following is cited:



       "Historical Injustice

       17. In order to qualify for settlement under this  policy  the  Home
       Office needs to be satisfied  that  the  former  Gurkha  would  have
       applied to settle in the UK upon discharge with the dependent  child
       if they had been born by then (but otherwise the  child  would  have
       been born here). If a sponsor states that he intended to  settle  in
       the UK on discharge, then, in  the  absence  of  any  countervailing
       evidence, this requirement will normally be considered to have  been
       met.

       18. Examples of countervailing  evidence  might  include  situations
       where:

               the sponsor did not apply promptly  when  the  discretionary
       police was announced; or

               the sponsor has a history of dishonesty;

              the former Gurkha did not return to his family  in  Nepal  on
       discharge (e.g. because he went to work elsewhere).

       If the decision  maker  does  not  feel  that  this  requirement  is
       satisfied and they have referred the matter  to  a  senior  decision
       maker, they should normally propose refusal of  the  application  on
       this ground.

   36. At paragraph 15(vii) the judge set out that he did not  accept  that
       the sponsor would have settled in the UK upon his discharge from the
       army, if able to do so, based on his assessment that the sponsor had
       given  "evidence  of  convenience"  concerning  the  financial   and
       emotional dependence of the appellant  upon  the  sponsor  and  that
       sponsor had stated that he had not lived apart  from  the  appellant
       for more than two years.




   37. We are satisfied that the basis on  which  the  judge  rejected  the
       evidence of the sponsor is inadequately reasoned. As set out  above,
       the assessment made of dependency  between  the  appellant  and  the
       sponsor was flawed. Furthermore, when making that finding the  judge
       failed to take into account the sponsor's evidence  in  his  witness
       statement on this issue and  also  failed  to  have  regard  to  the
       chronology of events in this context. The appellant had been  living
       with her parents in Nepal prior to her entering the UK as a  student
       on the 20 October 2010. She was supported by her  parents  whilst  a
       student. When the sponsor entered  the  UK  on  21  July  2011,  the
       appellant and the sponsor resumed family life together and  in  2013
       her mother entered the UK and the family lived  together  until  the
       appellant retuned to Nepal in 2014 and the  visits had been made  to
       Nepal where the sponsor and the appellant had  lived  together.  The
       reference to not living apart for two years was a reference to  that
       chronology.


   38. Further the basis on which the judge rejected the  evidence  of  the
       father that he would have settled in the UK on  discharge  from  the
       army is not in our view adequately reasoned  in  the  light  of  his
       clear evidence.


   39. Accordingly, we find that in this case the first-tier Tribunal judge
       fell into error in that he failed properly to consider the  evidence
       in reaching a conclusion on the existence of family life.


   40. As the first Tier Tribunal judge concluded that there was no  family
       life, his conclusion on proportionality was obiter.  However as  was
       conceded in oral submissions for the respondent, it is difficult  to
       understand the approach  of  the  judge  to  proportionality  having
       regard to Annex K (Adult Children of Former Gurkhas) which states:

              "26. Where  an  application  falls  for  refusal  under  this
             policy, the decision maker must  consider  whether  Article  8
             otherwise requires them to be granted leave on  the  basis  of
             exceptional circumstances  in  accordance  with  the  guidance
             contained in Appendix FM 1.0b: Family Life (as  a  Partner  or
             Parent) and Private Life: 10-year Routes.
             27.As   part   of   any   proportionality   aspect   of   this
             consideration,  decision  makers  must  take  account  of  the
             following relevant case law:
             The Court of Appeal confirmed in  Gurung  &  Ors,  R  (on  the
             application of) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
             [2013] ECWA Civ 8 (21 January 2013) that the "normal  position
             is that they (adult dependent relatives) are expected to apply
             for leave to enter or remain under the relevant provisions  of
             the Rules or under the provisions of Article 8 of the European
             Convention on Human Rights". The Court  also  found  that  the
             historical injustice faced by Gurkhas who  were  not  able  to
             settle in the UK until  2009  should  be  taken  into  account
             during the Article 8 consideration of the  case  but  was  not
             determinative. If a Gurkha can show that, but for the historic
             injustice, he would have settled in the UK at a time when  his
             dependant (now) adult child would have been able to  accompany
             him as a dependant child under the age of 18, that is a strong
             reason for holding that it  is  proportionate  to  permit  the
             adult child to join his family now". The Upper  Tier  Tribunal
             found in Ghising and others [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC) that where
             it is found that  Article  8  is  engaged  and,  but  for  the
             historic wrong, the Appellant would have been settled  in  the
             UK long ago, this will ordinarily determine the outcome of the
             Article  8  proportionality  assessment  in  the   Appellant's
             favour, where the matters relied  upon  by  the  Secretary  of
             State/entry clearance officer  (ECO)  consist  solely  of  the
             public interest in maintaining a firm immigration  policy.  If
             the Secretary of State/ECO can point to matters over and above
             the public interest in maintaining a firm immigration  policy,
             which argue in favour of removal or the refusal  of  leave  to
             enter, these matters must be given appropriate weight  in  the
             balance in the Secretary of State/ECO's favour.  Thus,  a  bad
             immigration history and/or criminal  behaviour  may  still  be
             sufficient to outweigh the powerful  factors  bearing  on  the
             Appellant's side of the balance." [emphasis added]


   41. In our view, this was not a case where the Secretary of State  could
       point to matters such as a bad immigration history  and/or  criminal
       behaviour which outweighed the "powerful  factors"  bearing  on  the
       appellant's side of the balance.




   42. Accordingly, the error in relation  to  family  life  was  material,
       since the outcome  of  any  proportionality  balance  would  in  the
       circumstances of this case come down in favour of the appellant.


   43. For the reasons set out above we are satisfied that the decision  of
       the first-tier tribunal involved the making of an error on  a  point
       of law and set aside the decision of the first-tier Tribunal.



   44. We now proceed to remake  the  decision,  no  fresh  evidence  being
       required or relied upon.



   45. We accept that it was for the  appellant  to  show  that  there  was
       family life between the appellant and her father  and  the  question
       whether an individual enjoys family life is one of factor depends on
       a careful consideration of the facts. We  also  accept  that  it  is
       unclear why the appellant is not working in Nepal but  the  evidence
       is that amounts are being sent on a regular basis by the appellant's
       father and that she is not  working.  There  is  no  evidence  which
       rebuts that evidence and we note that Annex K states:

       "evidence of financial dependency may  include  the  fact  that  the
       applicant has not been supporting him or herself and working but has
       been financially supported, out of necessity by his  or  her  former
       Gurkhas sponsor, who has sent money regularly from the UK".




   46. We also take into account that the pre-migration position  was  that
       the appellant had lived with the sponsor as a family unit  prior  to
       her entry as a student in 2010 and upon both  her  parents  arrival,
       her father shortly thereafter in July 211 and her  mother  in  2013,
       the parties lived together as a family unit with them continuing  to
       provide support, both in a financial and emotional sense.




   47. Since their separation, the evidence also supports a conclusion that
       she is emotionally  dependent  upon  her  father:  the  evidence  of
       emotional dependency is not just  the  visits  and  telephone  calls
       referred to in the judgement of the first-tier Tribunal but also the
       evidence that there is no other family members in Nepal.




   48. In our view  on  the  evidence  when  considered  holistically,  the
       appellant has demonstrated that she is financially  and  emotionally
       dependant on the sponsor and that that the support provided is  that
       which is 'real' or 'committed' and 'effective'. We find  that  there
       is family life between the sponsor and the appellant.


   49. Accordingly we then proceed  to  consider  proportionality.  If  the
       appellant falls for refusal under the policy by reason of  the  fact
       that she does not meet the requirement not to have lived  apart  for
       more than 2 years, then Annex K requires  consideration  of  whether
       Article 8 requires the appellant to be granted leave on the basis of
       exceptional circumstances. As noted  above,  Annex  K  requires  the
       decision maker to have regard to the case law and "where it is found
       engaged and, but for the historic wrong, the  appellant  would  have
       been settled in the UK long ago, this will ordinarily determine  the
       outcome  of  the  article  8  proportionality  assessment   in   the
       appellant's favour, where the matters relied upon by  the  Secretary
       of  State/entry  clearance  officer  consists  only  of  the  public
       interest in maintaining a firm immigration policy".


   50. The evidence of the sponsor is that he  applied  for  settlement  in
       2011, at that time the appellant was already in the UK but  she  was
       an adult. When the policy changed in 2015 to allow  adult  dependent
       children of former Gurkha soldiers up to the age of 30 to apply  for
       settlement, the appellant did not  do  so  on  the  basis  that  the
       appellant's name was not mentioned in the  official  family  records
       (the "kindred roll"). Although the First Tier  judge  rejected  that
       explanation on the basis that there was nothing  within  the  policy
       which referred to any requirement to appear in the  family  records,
       this has no bearing on her entitlement and  there  was  no  evidence
       which would justify a finding that the appellant's  father  was  not
       credible in this regard. The policy does state that the relation  to
       the sponsor has to be adequately demonstrated.


   51. Accordingly we find that but for the historic wrong,  the  appellant
       would have settled in the UK and in this case there are  no  factors
       such as a bad immigration history or criminal behaviour to  outweigh
       the "powerful factors"  bearing  on  the  appellant's  side  of  the
       balance.


   52. We therefore conclude that the appellant's Article 8 rights outweigh
       the interests of the  Secretary  of  State  in  maintaining  a  firm
       immigration policy and we remake the decision by allowing the appeal
       against the decision of the respondent to refuse entry clearance for
       settlement.
