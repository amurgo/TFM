                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and


                             ANASTASIYA KRATSOVA

                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Mrs Anastasiya Kratsova is a citizen of Belarus  who  appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal against the decision of the respondent refusing her
    a permanent residence card as the family member  of  an  EEA  National.
    Following discussion at the  hearing,  the  appeal  was  allowed.   The
    Secretary of State now has permission to appeal.

 2. Following the grant of permission I wrote to the parties seeking  their
    comments on my proposal to dismiss the appeal,  for  the  reasons  that
    follow.

        "I note that the judge allowed the appeal simply on the basis  that
        "the  decision  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  law",  "as  the
        Respondent has not considered Regulation 10(5)  and  14(3)  of  the
        2006 Regulations".  Contrary to what is suggested in the  Secretary
        of State's grounds, the  judge  made  no  finding  on  whether  the
        requirements of those or any other regulations were fulfilled.


        The effect of his determination is that the appellant's application
        remains  outstanding  awaiting  a  lawful  decision.   That,  as  I
        understand the Secretary of State's position, is exactly  what  was
        agreed at the hearing".


 3. Neither party has, within the time allowed  for  response,  raised  any
    objection.

 4. There was no  error  of  law.   The  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  is
    dismissed.
