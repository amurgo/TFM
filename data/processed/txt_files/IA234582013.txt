                                   Between

                          Mr Vyacheslav Ovdyeyenko
                        (No Anonymity Direction Made)

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Bazini, instructed by Gulbenkian Andonian
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. At the hearing before me Mr Bazini submitted that one of the witnesses
      for the appellant had been taken to hospital and would be unable to
      attend.  Mr Melvin did not challenge an adjournment.


   2. Mr Bazini accepted that the IS 151 notice had been served on the
      appellant in 1998.  He now submitted that the evidence disclosed that
      the appellant had a relationship within the UK with Ms Galitcki which
      was not previously argued.

   3. Having found an error of law in the First Tier Tribunal determination
      the matter is remitted to the First Tier Tribunal in accordance with
      Practice Direction 7.2(b) of the Presidential Practice Statement dated
      25 September 2012.  Having regard to the nature and extent of the
      judicial fact finding necessary in order for the decision in the
      appeal to be re-made in the light of  the overriding objective in rule
      2, it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.


Signed                                       Date 29th September 2014


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington
