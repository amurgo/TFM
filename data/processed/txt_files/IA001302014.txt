For the respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1. The appellant is Muhammad  Waqas  Khalid,  a  national  of  Pakistan.  He
   appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary
   of State dated 4 December 2013 to refuse his  application  for  leave  to
   remain as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant  under  the  Points  Based
   System. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Braybrook dismissed his  appeal.
   He now appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

2. The background to this appeal is that the appellant entered the UK  on  a
   Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant in April 2011 with leave to enter  until
   30 October 2012. He applied to extend his leave before the expiry of  his
   leave to enter, electing to pay the specified fee through  a  bank  card.
   That application was rejected by the respondent as invalid  in  a  letter
   from the respondent dated 17 December 2012 on the basis that the required
   fee had not been paid. The appellant  made  a  fresh  application  on  21
   December 2012. This time the fee was collected  from  his  bank  account.
   That application was refused on 4 December 2013  and  the  appellant  was
   informed that he had no right of appeal as the application had been  made
   out of time. The application was  refused  because  the  bank  statements
   submitted, which  were  the  same  as  those  submitted  with  the  first
   application and ended on 16 October 2013, were, by the time of the second
   application, dated more than a month prior to the date of the application
   and the appellant therefore failed to gain the  required  10  points  for
   maintenance. The appellant lodged an appeal which processed by  the  duty
   Judge as a valid appeal.

3. At the hearing in the First-tier Tribunal the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   had documentation from the respondent in relation to the payment  of  the
   fee [4]. The Judge did not make any  finding  as  to  whether  the  first
   application had been made in time.  The  Judge  noted  however  that  the
   appellant's representatives conceded that the appellant could not succeed
   under the Immigration Rules and the Judge  considered  the  appeal  under
   Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. He found  that  any
   interference to the appellant's private life as a result of the delay  by
   the respondent in considering the application was  proportionate  to  the
   legitimate objectives set out in Article 8.2.

4. The appellant applied for permission to  appeal  against  the  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge's decision on the grounds that the Judge erred in  failing
   to make any finding on the preliminary issue as to whether  there  was  a
   valid right of appeal and failing to consider the evidence submitted with
   the October application. It is contended that he  erred  in  that,  after
   having assumed jurisdiction and accepted that the application was made in
   time, he failed to assess  the  appeal  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
   submitted with the original application. It is further contended that the
   Judge erred in failing to consider evidence as to the  maintenance  funds
   held by the appellant's father. Finally, it is contended that  the  Judge
   misdirected himself in the context of Article 8 in  failing  to  consider
   whether the appellant had a legitimate expectation as  a  result  of  the
   time and money he had invested in his education in the UK.

5. Permission to appeal was refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
   application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal. On 18 February 2015  Upper
   Tribunal Judge Hanson granted permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
   on the basis that it is arguable that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge is bad for want of jurisdiction because, as the  appellant
   made an out of time application for leave to remain, he had no  leave  to
   remain at the time the application was made and in those circumstances  a
   refusal to grant leave is not  an  immigration  decision  as  defined  in
   section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and  so
   there is no right of appeal. The parties were  given  an  opportunity  to
   respond to Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson's preliminary view in relation  to
   jurisdiction and he sought their consent to the determination  being  set
   aside and the appeal being disposed of by being declared invalid for want
   of jurisdiction.

6. In the rule 24 response the respondent  consented  to  the  determination
   being set aside. However in submissions dated 11 March 2015 the appellant
   objected  to  this  proposal  contending  that  the  respondent  had  not
   discharged the burden of proof to establish that the application was made
   out of time in accordance  with  the  decision  in  Basnet  (validity  of
   application - respondent ) [2012] UKUT 00113(IAC). The  matter  therefore
   proceeded to a hearing.

7. At the hearing before me Mr Melvin accepted that the appellant had  leave
   to remain when he made the application in  October  2012.  The  issue  is
   therefore whether that was a valid application. Mr Melvin submitted  that
   there was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that the respondent had
   attempted to obtain the fee  from  the  appellant's  bank  account  on  2
   November 2012 but that the transaction failed because  the  authorisation
   was declined. Ms Price submitted that the appellant had  not  seen  these
   documents prior to the Upper Tribunal  hearing.  However  the  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge clearly referred to the documents at paragraph  4  of  the
   determination so it was before him.  The  appellant  was  represented  by
   counsel at the hearing and there was every opportunity to deal with  this
   issue. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal clearly deal with
   this issue. This was obviously an issue the  parties  were  aware  of  in
   advance of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. I  do  not  accept
   that the appellant had not previously seen this evidence.

8. Ms Price submitted that the appellant  should  have  been  provided  with
   this evidence in 2012 when the payment was declined so that he could have
   provided information from the bank. She relied on regulation  17  of  the
   Immigration  (Leave  to  Remain)  (Prescribed   Forms   and   Procedures)
   Regulations 2007 (SI 2007, No  882)  and  submitted  that  the  appellant
   should have been provided with an opportunity to  correct  the  situation
   within 28 days of the  payment  being  declined.  However  regulation  17
   refers  to  the  requirements  of  regulation  16  (1)  which   prescribe
   procedures in relation to the form and application but do  not  refer  to
   the payment of the fee.

9. Ms Price referred to  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  (Cost  Recovery
   Fees) Regulations 2011. This governs the payment of fees for applications
   for leave to remain. Regulation  38 provides:

    "Where an application  to  which  these  Regulations  refer  is  to  be
    accompanied by a specified fee, the application  is  not  validly  made
    unless it has been accompanied by that fee."

10. Accordingly the application is not  valid  if  not  accompanied  by  the
   specified fee. According to the documents submitted by the respondent the
   appellant elected to pay the fee of �394 through  a  visa/mastercard/amex
   card. He gave the card number (part of  which  is  redacted  on  he  copy
   before me) and signed the form. The respondent  submitted  a  transaction
   report showing that payment was declined on 2 November 2012 at 12.13.

11. The Lloyds Bank statement submitted by  the  appellant  shows  that  the
   appellant lodged �400 into his account on 2 November 2012.  There  is  no
   record as  to  the  time  at  which  the  funds  were  lodged.  The  last
   transaction prior to that lodgement was  on  16  October  2012  following
   which the balance was �5.77. It is therefore clear that if the money  was
   lodged after 12.13 the appellant did not have the required funds to cover
   the fee transaction. The appellant has not shown when he lodged the funds
   but on the basis of the transaction report submitted by the respondent it
   is unlikely that he lodged the funds before 12.13. In these circumstances
   I find that the respondent has established that she attempted  to  obtain
   the fee on 2 November 2012 but  that  the  appellant  did  not  have  the
   required funds. In  those  circumstances  the  application  was  properly
   considered to be invalid and returned to the appellant. As the subsequent
   application made by the application was after the expiry of his leave  to
   remain it does not attract a right of appeal because a refusal  to  grant
   leave is not an immigration decision as defined in Section 82 of the 2002
   Act.

12. As stated by Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson in his grant of  permission  to
   appeal if jurisdiction does not exist in law it cannot be 'conferred'  or
   'accepted'. In Virk & Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department
   [2013] EWCA Civ 652 it was held that although the Secretary of State  had
   failed to  raise  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  issue  of  that
   Tribunal's jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to  remain,
   the Upper Tribunal was entitled to dismiss the subsequent appeal  against
   the First-tier Tribunal's decision  on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal had not had jurisdiction, notwithstanding that the point had not
   been raised below.  The Court of Appeal said at paragraph 23;

    "Statutory jurisdiction cannot be conferred by waiver or agreement;  or
    by the failure of the parties or the tribunal to be alive to the point.
    Although,  as  Longmore  LJ  pointed  out,  decisions   taken   without
    jurisdiction may in due course become irreversible, that point has  not
    been reached in this case. It was, in my judgment, open to  either  the
    FTT or the UT to take the point about jurisdiction notwithstanding  the
    failure of the Secretary of State to raise it herself."

13.  In these circumstances I find that the  Duty  Judge  erred  in  finding
   there was a valid appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  and  that  Judge
   Braybrook erred in not  considering  this  issue  on  the  basis  of  the
   evidence before him. I therefore set aside  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Braybrook in its entirety.

14. In these circumstances I find that the Judge made a  material  error  of
   law by failing to consider whether he had any jurisdiction  to  hear  the
   appeal before purporting  to  dismiss  it.  I  find  that  there  was  no
   jurisdiction for all the reasons set out above and the  decision  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal is accordingly set aside and is remade by  dismissing
   the appeal.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error on a point of law.

There was no jurisdiction to hear the appeal and the decision of the First-
tier Tribunal is set aside and remade by dismissing the appeal.
