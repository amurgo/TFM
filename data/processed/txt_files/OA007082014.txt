                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. In this  appeal,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  appeals  against  a
       decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  appeal  of  Mrs
       Sultana ('the claimant') who appealed against a decision taken on  19
       November 2013 to refuse her entry clearance  on  the  basis  that  i)
       false representations had been made, ii) information was missing from
       employers' letters, iii) that  there  was  no  corresponding  monthly
       credits  in  the  sponsor's  personal  bank  statements  relating  to
       employment with Daawat (which the Entry  Clearance  Officer  asserted
       ceased on 5 April 2013), iv) that the  income  from  this  employment
       could not be taken into consideration and therefore v) the  sponsor's
       income was  below the threshold of �18,600.

Background Facts

    2. The claimant is a citizen of Bangladesh who  was  born  on  31  March
       1981.  She applied for entry clearance (settlement as a  partner)  to
       join her husband, Mr Aketer Uddin  Ferdous,  in  the  United  kingdom
       under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules HC395 (as  amended)  ('the
       Immigration Rules').  That application was refused  for  the  reasons
       set out above.

Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

    3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. In a determination
       promulgated on 24 February 2015, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Coll)
       allowed the claimant's appeal. The only issue in dispute by the  time
       of the hearing was whether or not the claimant could demonstrate that
       she met the financial requirements under the Immigration  Rules.  The
       First-tier Tribunal found that the sponsor's earnings were in  excess
       of �18,600 and therefore the claimant met the financial requirements.
       The judge took into consideration a number of documents not submitted
       to the Entry Clearance  Officer  and  the  witness  evidence  of  the
       sponsor in reaching her conclusion.

Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

    4. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal to the  Upper
       Tribunal.  On 28 April 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Brunnen granted
       the Entry Clearance Officer permission to appeal.  Thus,  the  appeal
       came before me.

Summary of the Submissions

    5. The grounds of appeal assert that the First-tier Tribunal judge erred
       in law by failing to have regard to  Appendix  FM-SE  paragraph  1(n)
       which requires that only the specified evidence set out  therein  can
       be relied on to determine the sponsor's gross income where payment is
       received in cash. It is asserted that it is not open to the judge  to
       draw his own conclusions based on the credibility of the  sponsor  or
       other documents in the absence of those specified in the  Immigration
       Rules. It is also asserted that it was not open to the judge to waive
       the requirements of Appendix FM-SE with regard to the contents of the
       employers' letters. Mr Walker relied on the  grounds  of  appeal  and
       drew attention to the amount of cash deposited amounting  to  �5,840.
       Paragraph 1(n) is  prescriptive.  If  the  cash  deposited  does  not
       directly match the net amount shown on payslips  then  only  the  net
       cash deposited can be taken into consideration in calculating income.
       With regard to waiving the documentary requirements, at paragraph  34
       of the First-tier Tribunal decision, Mr Walker submitted that it  was
       not open to the judge to waive those requirements.

    6. At the hearing Mr Miah handed up  an  annual  tax  summary  from  Her
       Majesty's Revenue and Customs ('HMRC') for the  tax  year  2013-2014.
       This evidence was  not  admitted  -  no  application  had  been  made
       pursuant to Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
       Rules 2008. In any event it was not evidence that  could  verify  the
       sponsor's earnings during the relevant  period  because  it  included
       income from periods and from other employers post  the  date  of  the
       decision. He submitted that the claimant earned in excess of  �18,600
       in the relevant period as confirmed by the documents from HMRC  (that
       were before the First-tier Tribunal judge). I  referred  Mr  Miah  to
       Paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE and the specific  wording  contained
       therein. He acknowledged that he was in some difficulty as  the  Rule
       is, on the face of it, very prescriptive. However, he submitted  that
       the documents submitted by the sponsor demonstrate his  earnings  and
       whilst there may be a good reason for the Rules being prescriptive in
       this case the claimant does now have  the  evidence  to  support  the
       sponsor's earnings as at the date of the decision.

    7. In relation to Article 8 Mr Miah submitted that if the judge believed
       the income was over �18,600, even though not in specified form,  then
       it can be considered that whilst on  a  strict  technical  basis  the
       claimant has not met the rules,  nevertheless  under  Article  8  the
       appeal can be allowed. Mr Miah was not asserting that this was a near
       miss case, the point was that that claimant had met the  requirements
       but just not the technical evidential requirements -  this  was  made
       good by the subsequent evidence. Mr Miah did not make any submissions
       as to additional or compelling circumstances as  to  why  the  appeal
       should be allowed outside of the Immigration Rules.

Discussion

    8. The First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
       claimant  earned  in  excess  of  �18,600.  Appendix  FM-SE  of   the
       Immigration Rules  -  Paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  sets  out  the  financial
       requirements that the claimant is required to satisfy in this case:

         The applicant must provide specified  evidence,  from  the  sources
         listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of-

         (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-

         (i) �18,600;...

    9. In order to reach the conclusion that the sponsor earned in excess of
       �18,600  the  judge  considered  several  documents  that  were   not
       submitted to the Entry  Clearance  Officer,  took  into  account  the
       witness evidence of the sponsor and also waived various  requirements
       of the Immigration Rules.

Appendix FM-SE paragraph 1(n)

   10. The judge recorded that the Tribunal was referred  to  personal  bank
       statements of the sponsor showing deposits totalling  �5,840  of  his
       net income from Daawat (para 17). The judge also  recorded  that  the
       Entry Clearance Officer  had  refused  the  application  because  the
       sponsor's personal bank statements did  not  show  that  salary  from
       Daawat corresponding to the same period and amount as the wage  slips
       had been paid into the sponsor's bank account in spite of the mode of
       payment being listed as BACS on the payslips (paragraphs 25 and  26).
       The judge set out the relevant applicable Immigration Rules referring
       to Appendix FM-SE Paragraph 2 (b) summarising as follows:

         'The applicant must provide a letter from the employer  who  issued
         [the payslips] confirming (i) the  person's  employment  and  gross
         annual salary, (ii) length of their employment,  (iii)  the  period
         over which they have been paid or were paid  the  level  of  salary
         relied  upon  in  the  application  and  personal  bank  statements
         corresponding to the same period  and  amount  as  the  wage  slips
         showing that the salary has been paid into an account in  the  name
         of the sponsor.'

   11. The judge accepted that the sponsor was paid in cash  by  Daawat  and
       that the payslips mistakenly  recorded  he  was  paid  by  BACS.  She
       accepted that the deposits of  �5,840  were  his  net  income  (after
       expenditure) from Daawat for a six month period and  made  a  finding
       that he was paid �14,000 gross per annum from Daawat (para 31)

   12. It is worth setting out the provisions referred to by  the  judge  in
       full. Appendix FM-SE at paragraph 2:

         '2. In respect of salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:

         (a) Payslips covering:

             (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of  application  if
             the person has been employed by their current employer for  at
             least 6 months (and where paragraph  13(b)  of  this  Appendix
             does not apply); or ...

         (b) A letter from  the  employer(s)  who  issued  the  payslips  at
         paragraph 2(a) confirming:

             (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;

             (ii) the length of their employment;

             (iii) the period over which they have been or  were  paid  the
             level of salary relied upon in the application; and

             (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or
             agency).

         (c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s) as
         the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the  salary  has  been
         paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the  name  of
         the person and their partner jointly'

   13. All of the requirements in Paragraph 2 must be met. To make sense  of
       the requirement for personal bank  statements  corresponding  to  the
       payslips sub-paragraph 2(c) must, in my view, be  read  as  requiring
       that the exact amounts shown on the payslips are paid into  the  bank
       account and that the salary has been paid into the  bank  account  by
       the employer. If the payments are made  by  someone  other  than  the
       employer such payments are not corroborative of the  salary  claimed.
       Support for this position is to  be  gained  from  the  provision  of
       paragraph 1(n) which provides that where an employee is paid in  cash
       an alternative to  payment  directly  into  a  bank  account  by  the
       employer is permissible. This provides:

         '(n) The gross amount of any cash income may be counted  where  the
         person's specified  bank  statements  show  the  net  amount  which
         relates to the gross amount shown on  their  payslips  (or  in  the
         relevant specified evidence provided in addition to  the  specified
         bank statements in relation to non-employment  income).  Otherwise,
         only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements  may  be
         counted.'

   14. It was not open to the judge to find from the evidence that the gross
       salary from Daawat was �14,000. The bank statements did not show that
       the salary had been paid into the sponsor's account by Daawat. As the
       income was paid into the sponsor's account in cash the provisions  of
       paragraph 1(n) apply. The judge does not appear  to  have  considered
       this provision. The Immigration  Rule  is  prescriptive  for  obvious
       reasons. The reason for  the  specified  evidence  is  to  verify  or
       corroborate precisely how much is earned by the sponsor.  Where  cash
       is involved this is much more difficult to verify. The  Rule  permits
       the gross amount shown on a payslip to be counted  but  only  if  the
       cash deposits relate directly to the gross  amounts  shown  on  their
       payslips. In the instant case the sponsor paid amounts of  cash  that
       did not correspond to the gross amounts on  his  payslips.  Whilst  I
       have some sympathy with the sponsor's position the rule is clear  and
       is rational for the reasons I have given. The only amount that can be
       counted is the net cash paid into the account found to be �5,480.

   15. I have considered the relevant  Immigration  Directorate  Instruction
       (Family Migration:  Appendix  FM  Section  1.73.1.5.).  The  relevant
       section supports the interpretation above:

         'Under paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE the  gross  amount  of  any
         cash income may  be  counted  where  the  person's  specified  bank
         statements show the deposit of the full net amount which relates to
         the gross amount shown  on  their  payslips  (or  in  the  relevant
         specified evidence provided  in  addition  to  the  specified  bank
         statements in relation to non-employment income).  Otherwise,  only
         the net amount shown  on  the  specified  bank  statements  may  be
         counted. Those wishing  to  rely  on  cash  income  to  sponsor  an
         application subject to the financial requirement may need to change
         the way they manage their money and bank the  full  net  amount  so
         that they can then rely on the  gross  amount  of  that  income  in
         sponsoring the application. Like the other evidential  requirements
         of Appendix FM-SE which seek  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  the
         system for all genuine applicants and  sponsors,  it  is  important
         that those wishing to rely on the gross amount of their cash income
         from  employment  corroborate  this  income  through   their   bank
         statements,  as  well  as  the  required  payslips  and  employer's
         letter.'

   16. The judge erred in law in arriving at the conclusion that the sponsor
       earned in excess of �18,600. Only �5,480 could be counted  as  income
       from Daawat. Together with the �6,346 earnings from Tesco  the  total
       income that  the  sponsor  could  rely  on  in  accordance  with  the
       Immigration Rules is �11,826.

Waiver of the requirements for documentary evidence in specified form

   17. The judge found that the letters from the employers did  not  satisfy
       the documentary requirements but found that  she  could  waive  these
       requirements under Appendix FM-SE D considering that  the  length  of
       employment with Tesco and Daawat and gross annual salary  with  Tesco
       was 'verifiable from other documents'(para 34).

   18. It is not clear  precisely  which  part  of  paragraph  D  the  judge
       considered provided her with the power to waive the requirements  but
       presumably she relied on sub-paragraph (d) which provides:

         '(d) If the applicant has submitted:

         ...

         (iii)    A document that does not  contain  all  of  the  specified
         information, but the missing information is verifiable from:

          1) other documents submitted with the application, ...

             the application may be granted  exceptionally,  providing  the
             decision-maker is satisfied that the  document(s)  is  genuine
             and that the applicant meets  the  requirement  to  which  the
             document relates.'

   19. The first point  to  make  is  that  the  documents  that  the  judge
       considered which  verified  the  missing  information  were  not  all
       submitted with the application to the Entry  Clearance  Officer.  The
       second point is that the discretion in Appendix FM-SE D  is  that  of
       the decision maker not the First-tier Tribunal or this Tribunal.   In
       Sultana and Others (rules: waiver/further enquiry; discretion) [2014]
       UKUT 00540 (IAC) at paragraph 18 the Upper Tribunal when  considering
       the 'evidential flexibility' in Paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE held:

         "18. ... Thus there is no  basis  for  concluding  that  the  ECO's
         failure to exercise the discretion available  to  him  was  not  in
         accordance with  the  law.  It  is  appropriate  to  add  that  the
         discretion in question is conferred exclusively on the ECO  and  is
         not exercisable by either the FtT or this Tribunal on appeal."

   20. The judge erred in law. The requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules
       cannot be waived by the First-tier Tribunal.

   21. For completeness I note that in the grounds of appeal to  the  First-
       tier Tribunal the  claimant  asserted  that  'evidential  flexibility
       should be applied for (sic) a decision is made if  further  docs  are
       needed'.  Although not  clear  that  this  was  what  the  judge  was
       considering she made  further  findings  in  relation  to  the  Entry
       Clearance Officer's failure to exercise the discretion  available  to
       request additional information. She found that:

         "... had the ECO not incorrectly  concluded  that  the  application
         failed on grounds of making false representation, under Appendix FM-
         SE D (b) it is more likely than not that he would have  written  to
         the appellant to ask her to obtain fuller letters  from  Tesco  and
         Daawat or in  their  absence,  other  documents  which  could  have
         verified the missing information. I find  that  because  the  entry
         clearance officer made a charge of false representation, he applied
         instead  Appendix  FM-SE  D(c)  whereby  he  did  not  request  the
         omissions to be rectified."

   22. There was no specific conclusion reached  by  the  judge  as  to  the
       effect of those findings, for example there was no  specific  finding
       that the Entry Clearance Officer's decision  was  not  in  accordance
       with the law. It appears that the judge has sought  to  rely  on  her
       findings and inferences to support her in waiving the rules  herself.
       This is not a case of a minor defect or omission that can  be  easily
       remedied that requires the blunt instrument  of  immediate,  outright
       refusal to be softened. There was a substantive failure to  meet  the
       requirements for evidence in a specified form to have been provided.

   Article 8 of the Convention on Human rights

   23. The judge did not consider Article 8 having  concluded  the  claimant
       satisfied the Immigration Rules.

   24. Mr Miah did not make any substantive submissions that there were  any
       compelling circumstances outside the Immigration  Rules  that  render
       the Entry  Clearance  Officer's  decision  disproportionate.  It  was
       accepted that family life existed and that  Article  8  was  engaged.
       There is no 'exceptionality test' but there is a requirement to carry
       out  a  balancing  exercise  where  an  individual  cannot  meet  the
       requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.  The  public  interest  will
       generally  only  be  outweighed  if  an  applicant  can   show   that
       'compelling circumstances' exist - see paragraphs  40  to  42  of  SS
       (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

   25. In the case of Sunassee, R (on the application of) v  Upper  Tribunal
       (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) & Anor [2015] EWHC 1604 (Admin), the
       court held:

         "33. The decision of Sales J  in  Nagre  therefore,  as  explained,
         received the endorsement of the Court of Appeal and represents  the
         law. It has not been "overruled". It had  received  an  endorsement
         already in MM (Lebanon). The law is that there is always  a  second
         stage, but where all  relevant  considerations  have  been  weighed
         under the Rules and  there  are  no  compelling  circumstances  not
         sufficiently recognised under the Rules it will be enough  for  the
         decision maker simply to say that."

   26. In R (on the application of Mahmood) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
       Home Department [2001] INLR the court held:

         "The state has a right under international law to control the entry
         of non-nationals into its territory subject always  to  its  treaty
         obligations.  Article 8 does not impose on the  state  any  general
         obligation to respect the choice of residence of a married couple."

   27. There are no compelling circumstances in this case. In  carrying  out
       the  balancing  exercise  I  have  considered  section  117  of   the
       Nationality and Immigration  Act  2002.  Sufficient  weight  must  be
       accorded to the public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective
       immigration controls. Further, sufficient weight must be accorded  to
       the interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  in
       that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom  must
       be financially independent. I find that the public interest  in  this
       weighs against the claimant and consider that on the  facts  of  this
       case, and in the absence of any compelling circumstances, the balance
       falls in favour of refusal of entry clearance.

   Decision

   28. Giving effect to the above analysis and  conclusions  the  First-tier
       Tribunal decision contains material errors of law. I set  aside  that
       decision pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
       Enforcement Act 2007.

   29. I re-make the decision by dismissing the  claimant's  appeal  against
       the Entry Clearance Officer's decision. The claimant  does  not  meet
       the requirements of the Immigration Rules. Refusal of entry clearance
       is not disproportionate to the legitimate aims pursued. The  decision
       of the Entry Clearance Officer is affirmed.

   30. I have considered whether any parties require the  protection  of  an
       anonymity direction. No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously.
       Having considered  all  the  circumstances  and  evidence  I  do  not
       consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
