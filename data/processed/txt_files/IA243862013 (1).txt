               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent
NO ANONYMITY ORDER



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This matter comes before me for  remaking  the  decision  following  my
    finding that the the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision contained  an
    error of law.  I refer to my decision and directions  dated  28.5.2014.
    The Secretary of State is the appellant in this matter and for ease  of
    reference I shall refer to  the  parties  as  "the  claimant  "and  the
    Secretary of State.


2.   The claimant, whose date of birth is 25 August 1971, is  a  citizen  of
    Nigeria.  Her appeal outside of the Rules was allowed under  Article  8
    ECHR by First-tier Tribunal Judge  C  M  A  Jones  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 8 January 2014. That determination was  set  aside.  The
    essential   findings of fact as to date and nature of entry, details of
    former partnership, illegal status in  the  UK,  working  as  a  carer,
    establishing social network and the death of the British  partner  were
    preserved and are accepted.  The finding that was not preserved related
    to the claim of having entered  the  UK  trafficked  as  a  prostitute.
    There is  no  evidence  of  family  life  in  the  UK.   The  appellant
    established a private life between 1994 and 2010 during which time  she
    had no lawful leave in the UK.  The basis of  her  discretionary  leave
    granted in 2010 was the partnership which no longer  existed  following
    the death of her partner in 2012.

3.  In order to consider the claimant's private life under  Article  8  ECHR
    reference is made to guidance in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) .

         "Only if there were arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave  to
         remain outside of the Rules was it necessary for him for Article  8
         purposes to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  were  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules".


4.   Directions were issued by me on 9th June 2014 for  written  submissions
    from both parties to be filed and served within 10 days of the date  of
    issue, as to how the claimant met the guidance in Gulshan or  not,  and
    if applicable whether or not  Article 8 ECHR private life was  engaged.
    As at 2nd July 2014 I received no written submissions from  either  the
    claimant or from the Secretary  of  State.  Accordingly  I  proceed  to
    determine the appeal and remake the decision by substituting a decision
    to dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds . In so doing I allow the
    Secretary of State's appeal.

5.   I am satisfied that the claimant  failed to show that  there  are  good
    arguable grounds for granting leave outside  of  the  Rules.   She  has
    lived in the UK for a significant period of time, 19  years,   but  has
    not met the 20 year period of residence required under  the  Rules  and
    has pursued her private life in the UK largely  without  lawful  leave.
    She entered the UK illegally in 1994.  She  was  granted  discretionary
    leave on 19.3.2010 as the partner of a British citizen under Article  8
    ECHR. That leave expired on 18.3.2013.  Sadly  the  claimant's  partner
    died on 22.11.2012.  The claimant wished to be able to remain in the UK
    in order to attend to his grave and to continue  close  relations  with
    his family.  She further claimed that she had been trafficked into  the
    UK and that this was an exceptional circumstance.  I find  no  evidence
    to support this claim and the claimant has not pursued  the  matter  in
    any  submissions.  Whilst  I   accept   the   desire   for   continuing
    relationships with her partner's family, there is no evidence  to  show
    that the relationships are strong and/or significant.  Relations can be
    maintained by communication and visits. The claimant can  tend  to  her
    partner's grave on the occasion of visits to the UK.  The circumstances
    albeit compassionate  do  not  amount  to  good  arguable  grounds  for
    granting leave outside of the  rules.   The  claimant  has  an  elderly
    mother in Nigeria with whom she is in contact and she would  return  to
    some family life.  She has skills that she can utilise in  Nigeria  and
    obtain employment in the caring field.

6.  The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.
      The decision is remade to dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge G A Black

     No anonymity order made.
     A fee award was made by the First Tier Judge in the sum of  ï¿½140  which
    now lapses.  As I have dismissed the appeal there is no fee award made.
