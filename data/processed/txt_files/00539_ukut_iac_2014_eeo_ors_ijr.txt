There is nothing in R (Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),  Gulshan
(Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013]  UKUT  640  (IAC)
or Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT  00085  (IAC)  that  suggests
that a threshold test was being suggested as  opposed  to  making  it  clear
that there was a need to look at the evidence to see if there  was  anything
which has not already been adequately  considered  in  the  context  of  the
Immigration Rules and which could lead to  a  successful  Article  8  claim.
These authorities must not be read as  seeking  to  qualify  or  fetter  the
assessment of Article 8. This is  consistent  with  para  128  of  R  (MM  &
Others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985, that there is no utility in  imposing  a
further intermediate test as a preliminary to a consideration of an  Article
8  claim  beyond  the  relevant  criterion-based  Rule.  As  is  held  in  R
(Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin), there is no  prior  threshold
which dictates whether the exercise  of  discretion  should  be  considered;
rather the nature of the assessment and the reasoning which are  called  for
are informed by threshold considerations.



      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                                  JUDGMENT

                       Handed down on 29 October 2014
      ----------------------------------------------------------------


1. The applicants are nationals  of  Nigeria,  now  aged  (respectively)  53
   years, 59 years, 23 years and  20  years.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Storey
   granted permission to  challenge  the  lawfulness  of  decisions  of  the
   respondent, first made on 9 August 2013 (the first decision) supplemented
   on 18 March 2014 (the second decision) and  (in  respect  of  the  second
   applicant) a decision of 28 May 2014  (the  third  decision),  to  refuse
   their applications of 13 August 2012 for leave to remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom on the basis of their rights under Article 8 of the 1950 European
   Convention for the Protection of Human Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms
   (ECHR). The grounds upon which they challenge the decisions made on their
   individual Article 8 claims are summarised at [32] below.   In  addition,
   they  each  challenge  the  respondent's  failure  to   make   appealable
   immigration decisions with an in-country right of appeal.

2. In this particular case, it makes sense for me to describe and deal  with
   the legal issue of general interest before turning to the  facts  of  the
   individual applicants.

3. It is generally thought that,  in  R  (Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720
   (Admin), Sales J (as he then was) considered that, if an individual  does
   not satisfy the requirements for  the  grant  of  leave  under  (in  non-
   deportation cases) Appendix FM (in  relation  to  family  life)  or  para
   276ADE (in relation to private life) of the immigration Rules (the "IRs")
   introduced from 9 July 2012 by HC 194, it is only necessary  to  consider
   Article 8 outside the IRs if there is a  "good  arguable  case"  for  the
   grant of leave on the basis of Article 8.

4. The legal issue of general interest is whether the  observations  of  the
   Court of Appeal in R (MM & Others) v SSHD [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  in  the
   concluding words of para 128 (see [12]) below) should lead to a change in
   the approach that may have been thought to have been indicated  by  Sales
   J; in particular, whether a "threshold" of a "good arguable case" must be
   shown before the duty arises to consider Article 8 beyond any  IRs  which
   set out criteria for the consideration of family or private life.

5. Having described the legal issue briefly in this way, it is necessary  to
   go into some further detail:

6. From 9 July 2012, HC 194 introduced the criteria to be met  in  assessing
   the  private  and  family  life  claims  of  individuals.   In   criminal
   deportation cases, the relevant IRs are paras 398, 399 and  399A-D.  Para
   398 provides (in effect) that the first step is to consider whether paras
   399 or 399A apply. If they do not, para 398 provides that: "it will  only
   be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest  in  deportation
   will be outweighed by other factors". By HC 532 and with effect  from  28
   July 2014, this  has  been  amended  to:  "...  the  public  interest  in
   deportation will only be outweighed by other factors where there are very
   compelling circumstances over and above those described in paragraphs 399
   and 399A".

7. The relevant IRs in relation to private  life  in  non-deportation  cases
   are paras 276ADE to 276CE. If an individual does not  meet  the  criteria
   set out therein, then guidance issued by the Secretary of  State  in  the
   form of instructions provides, in effect, that leave  to  remain  outside
   the IRs could be granted  in  the  exercise  of  residual  discretion  in
   "exceptional circumstances" which are defined in  the  guidance.  In  the
   Nagre case, the  Secretary of State's guidance provided:

           "Exceptional" does not mean "unusual" or  "unique".  Whilst  all
           cases are to some extent unique, those  unique  factors  do  not
           generally render them exceptional. For example, a  case  is  not
           exceptional just  because  the  criteria  set  out  in  EX.1  of
           Appendix FM  have  been  missed  by  a  small  margin.  Instead,
           "exceptional" means circumstances in which refusal would  result
           in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that
           refusal of the application would not be proportionate.  That  is
           likely to be the case only very rarely."

8. In Nagre, Sales J said (at [30]):

         "...if, after the process of applying the  new  rules  and  finding
         that the claim for leave to remain under them fails,  the  relevant
         official  or  tribunal  judge  considers  it  is  clear  that   the
         consideration under the Rules has fully addressed any  family  life
         or private life  issues  arising  under  Article  8,  it  would  be
         sufficient simply to say that; they would not have  to  go  on,  in
         addition, to consider the case separately from the Rules. If  there
         is no arguable case that there may be  good  grounds  for  granting
         leave to remain outside the Rules by reference to Article 8,  there
         would be no point in introducing  full  separate  consideration  of
         Article 8 again after having reached a decision on  application  of
         the Rules."

9. Nagre was considered by the Court  of  Appeal  in  MF  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
   [2013] EWCA Civ 1192. As this was a deportation case, the IRs  that  were
   considered were paras 398, 399 and 399A. At [44], the Court held that the
   new IRs (by which the Court was referring to the IRs relating to criminal
   deportation  cases)  were  a  complete  code  and  that  the  exceptional
   circumstances to be considered in  the  balancing  exercise  involve  the
   application  of   a   proportionality   test   as   required   Strasbourg
   jurisprudence. At [45], the Court held that it  was  a  sterile  question
   whether the proportionality test was applied within the  IRs  or  outside
   the IRs; either way, the result would be the same.

10. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct  approach)  Pakistan  [2013]
   UKUT 640 (IAC), a reported determination of  the  Upper  Tribunal,  heard
   before Cranston J and Upper Tribunal Judge  Taylor,  the  Upper  Tribunal
   decided (at [24(b)] and citing Nagre) that, on the current state  of  the
   authorities, after applying the requirements of the IRs,  only  if  there
   may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them is
   it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to  consider  whether  there
   are compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

11. Also relevant is Shahzad (Art  8:  legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
   (IAC), the headnote for which (insofar as relevant) reads:


        "(iv)     MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
              immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal
              are  a  complete  code.  This  was  because  of  the  express
              requirement in them  at  paragraph  398  to  have  regard  to
              exceptional circumstances and other factors.


        (v)  It follows from this that any other rule which has  a  similar
              provision will also constitute a complete code;


        (vi) Where an area of the rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
              mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State for
              the Home Department [2013] EWHC  720  (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in
              particular) and Gulshan (Article 8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
              approach) [2013] UKUT 640  (IAC)  should  be  followed:  i.e.
              after applying the requirements of the rules, only  if  there
              may be arguably good grounds for  granting  leave  to  remain
              outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on
              to consider whether there are  compelling  circumstances  not
              sufficiently recognised under them."

12. At para 128 of MM, the Court of Appeal said:

             "Sales J's decision therefore follows the logic of  Laws  LJ's
             statements in [38]-[39]  of  AM  (Ethiopia),  analysed  above.
             However, there is a difference in that in Nagre the new  rules
             were themselves attempting to cover, generally,  circumstances
             where an individual should be allowed to remain in the  UK  on
             Article 8 grounds; whereas in AM (Ethiopia) and in the present
             appeals  the   rule   challenged   stipulates   a   particular
             requirement that has to be fulfilled before the applicant will
             be allowed to enter or remain. The argument in  each  case  is
             that it is that specific requirement that offends  Article  8.
             Nagre does not add  anything  to  the  debate,  save  for  the
             statement that if a particular person is outside the rule then
             he has to demonstrate, as a  preliminary  to  a  consideration
             outside the rule, that he has an arguable case that there  may
             be good grounds for  granting  leave  to  remain  outside  the
             rules. I cannot see much utility  in  imposing  this  further,
             intermediary, test. If the applicant cannot satisfy the  rule,
             then there either is or there  is  not  a  further  Article  8
             claim. That  will  have  to  be  determined  by  the  relevant
             decision-maker."

   Submissions of the parties on the legal issue

13. Mr Karim submitted that para 128 of MM means that, if there  is  a  good
   arguable Article 8 claim outside the  IRs,  it  is  always  necessary  to
   follow the five-step approach explained by Lord Bingham at para 17  of  R
   (Razgar) v SSHD (2004) UKHL 27.

14. Ms Thelen submitted that the Secretary of State's guidance  in  relation
   to "exceptional circumstances" is the means by which one decides  whether
   there is a good arguable case outside the IRs for the grant of  leave  on
   the basis of Article 8.  Ms Thelen referred me to the judgment of Michael
   Fordham QC sitting as Deputy High Court Judge in R (Ganesabalan)  v  SSHD
   [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin), where (at [21.(v)] and [25]), Mr. Fordham said:

         "21.(v)  There is no prior threshold  which  dictates  whether  the
                  exercise of discretion should be  considered;  rather  the
                  nature of the  assessment  and  the  reasoning  which  are
                  called for are informed by threshold considerations, those
                  threshold circumstances include (a)  whether  an  arguable
                  basis for the exercise of  the  discretion  has  been  put
                  forward; (b) whether the  relevant  factors  have  already
                  been  assessed;  (c)  whether  a  repeat   evaluation   is
                  unnecessary.

         25.  ...[para 33 of Green J's judgment in Ahmed v SSHD [2014]  EWHC
                  300 (Admin)], in  my  judgment,  very  clearly  recognises
                  that, having addressed the Immigration Rules  and  reached
                  conclusions on their  application,  there  is  a  duty  by
                  reference to the guidance on the decision  maker  then  to
                  step back and formulate a view. The need for a view is not
                  triggered by there being some good arguable basis. Rather,
                  as Green J there explains, one of the questions  -  indeed
                  the first question - to be considered in formulating  that
                  view, is the  question  whether  there  might  be  a  good
                  arguable case."

15. Ms Thelen submitted that,  in  saying  that  there  are  no  exceptional
   circumstances, the decision-maker is in effect saying that  there  is  no
   arguable basis for the exercise of discretion outside the IRs.  If  there
   is an arguable basis for the exercise of discretion outside the  IRs,  it
   may be necessary for the decision-maker to go on to  consider  Article  8
   "in the Razgar sense"; certain cases  may  require  more  reasoning  than
   others. She submitted that this approach is entirely consistent with para
   128 of MM.

16. In response, Mr Karim submitted  that  the  threshold  for  saying  that
   there are "arguable grounds" is low, whereas the threshold for a decision
   that there  are  "exceptional  circumstances"  is  higher.  He  therefore
   submitted that Ms Thelen's proposition, that a decision  by  a  decision-
   maker that there are no exceptional circumstances means that the decision-
   maker has decided that there is no arguable case for the grant  of  leave
   to remain on the basis of Article 8, conflates two thresholds and results
   in the application of the wrong test. Para 128 of MM clearly states  that
   there is no need for an intermediate test. Furthermore,  given  that  the
   IRs do not cater exhaustively for all possible circumstances  that  might
   arise  under  Article  8,  there  must  be  circumstances  outside  those
   specifically provided for under the IRs that raise a good arguable case.

17. On the specific facts of  the  case,  and  relying  upon  the  Court  of
   Appeal's judgment in UE (Nigeria) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ  975,  Mr  Karim
   submitted that the value to the community in the  United  Kingdom  of  an
   individual, for example, on account  of  his  or  her  occupation,  is  a
   relevant consideration in the proportionality exercise.  Any  benefit  to
   the public of an individual being allowed to remain in the United Kingdom
   (for example, if the individual has skills which are in short supply)  is
   one of those identified as a relevant factor. Thus,  the  fact  that  Mrs
   Oludoyi is a nurse means that she has a good arguable case for the  grant
   of leave outside the IRs. Once a good arguable  case  is  shown,  as  Mrs
   Oludoyi has by virtue  of  her  occupation,  it  was  necessary  for  the
   decision-maker to assess her Article 8 claim by following  the  five-step
   approach explained  in  Razgar.  Instead,  the  decision-maker  proceeded
   immediately to the issue of proportionality.

   Discussion of the legal issue

18. I shall hereafter refer to any IR which sets  out  the  criteria  to  be
   satisfied for any family life or private life claim as a "criterion-based
   Rule", to distinguish it from any IR which  imports  the  proportionality
   test. Prior to 28 July 2014, the IRs imported the proportionality test by
   the use of the phrase "exceptional circumstances" (see, for example, para
   398).  From  28  July  2014,  the  IRs  amended  para  398  so  that  the
   proportionality test for the purpose of para 398 is imported by  the  use
   of the phrase "very compelling circumstances over and above...".  In  the
   case of para 276ADE, where there is no express provision within  the  IRs
   which imports the  proportionality  test,  the  proportionality  test  is
   imported into the guidance by the use of the phrase: "exceptional"  means
   circumstances in  which  refusal  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
   consequences for the individual such  that  refusal  of  the  application
   would not be proportionate" from  which  phrase  it  is  clear  that  the
   Secretary of State accepts that domestic and Strasbourg jurisprudence  as
   to proportionality continue to apply.

19. It is not in dispute that:

   i.     Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which  makes  it  unlawful
       for a public authority to act in a way which  is  incompatible  with
       Article 8 (amongst other "Convention rights"  as  therein  defined),
       still applies.

   ii.    The judgment of the Supreme Court in Huang v SSHD  [2007]  UKHL  1
       still applies.

   iii.   Strasbourg and domestic jurisprudence in  relation  to  Article  8
       still applies.

   iv.    There is nothing in Huang or in other  domestic  jurisprudence  or
       Strasbourg jurisprudence  which  supports  the  proposition  that  a
       threshold must be reached  before  the  obligation  to  consider  an
       Article 8 claim arises.

   v.     Likewise, in my judgement, there is nothing in MF (Nigeria)  which
       suggests that the Court of Appeal considered that, in cases which do
       not meet the requirements of paras 399 or 399A, there is a threshold
       requirement (in the sense of  whether  there  is  a  "good  arguable
       case") before it becomes necessary to consider proportionality.

20. There is nothing in Nagre, Gulshan  or  Shahzad  that  suggests  that  a
   threshold test was being suggested as opposed to  making  it  clear  that
   there was a need to look at the evidence to see  if  there  was  anything
   which has not already been adequately considered in the  context  of  the
   IRs and which could lead  to  a  successful  Article  8  claim.  If,  for
   example, there is some feature which has not been  adequately  considered
   under the IRs but which cannot on any view lead to the  Article  8  claim
   succeeding  (when   the   individual's   circumstances   are   considered
   cumulatively), there is no need to go any further.  This  does  not  mean
   that a threshold or intermediate test is being applied. These authorities
   must not be read as seeking  to  qualify  or  fetter  the  assessment  of
   Article 8. The guidance given must be read in context and  not  construed
   as if the judgments are pieces of legislation.

21. In this respect, an analogy can be drawn with the explanation  given  by
   the Master of the Rolls at [42] of MF (Nigeria) to the  effect  that  the
   use of the phrase "exceptional circumstances" does not  necessarily  mean
   that a test of exceptionality is being applied. The explanation given was
   as follows:

        "...it  is  only  in  "exceptional"  or   "the   most   exceptional
        circumstances" that removal of the non-national family member  will
        constitute a violation of article 8.   In our view, that is not  to
        say that a test of exceptionality is being applied.  Rather  it  is
        that,  in  approaching  the  question  of  whether  removal  is   a
        proportionate interference with an individual's article  8  rights,
        the scales are  heavily  weighted  in  favour  of  deportation  and
        something very compelling (which will be "exceptional") is required
        to outweigh the public interest in removal.  In our view, it is  no
        coincidence that the phrase "exceptional circumstances" is used  in
        the new rules in the context of weighing the competing factors  for
        and against deportation of foreign criminals."

22. This view is consistent with para 128  of  the  MM,  that  there  is  no
   utility in imposing a further intermediate test as  a  preliminary  to  a
   consideration of an Article 8 claim beyond the  relevant  criterion-based
   Rule.

23. If there may arguably be good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
   outside the IRs, then the question whether it is  necessary  to  consider
   all five of the five-step approach explained in Razgar or whether it will
   be possible to proceed immediately to  the  proportionality  exercise  as
   explained in the fourth and fifth steps explained in Razgar may vary from
   case to case. It may depend on the assessment that has  been  made  under
   the relevant criterion-based IR. If, in the process of assessing  whether
   an individual satisfies a criterion-based IR(s), findings as  to  whether
   family life or private life is being enjoyed have been made, it would  be
   futile to introduce the full  five-step  approach  when  considering  the
   Article 8 claim beyond the criterion-based Rule. In these  circumstances,
   it would be permissible to proceed to the proportionality test since  the
   second and third steps are not contentious in most cases.  By  way  of  a
   further example, if the circumstances relied upon for the grant of  leave
   outside the IRs relate to matters that go to proportionality (such as  an
   argument that the work that the individual does is of public benefit), it
   may be permissible to proceed to  proportionality.  I  therefore  do  not
   accept Mr Karim's submission that it is always necessary  to  follow  the
   five-step approach explained in Razgar.

24. I turn now to deal with the individual cases in the instant claim.

   The Applicants' challenges

   Immigration history and factual background

25. For convenience and without meaning any disrespect,  I  shall  hereafter
   refer to the applicants, respectively,  as  Mrs.  Oludoyi,  Mr.  Oludoyi,
   Christianah and Samuel. Christianah and Samuel are the son  and  daughter
   (respectively) of Mr. and Mrs. Oludoyi.

26. Mrs. Oludoyi trained as a nurse in the United  Kingdom,  having  arrived
   in the United Kingdom as a student on 18 January 2006  when  she  was  45
   years of age and subsequently been granted a work permit for  four  years
   which expired on 3 October 2010. As at 9 August 2013,  the  date  of  the
   first decision, she had lived in the United Kingdom for about 7 �  years.
   Mr. Oludoyi, Christianah and Samuel arrived in the United Kingdom  on  25
   June 2008 when they were (respectively) 53 years, 17 years 8  months  and
   14 years 7  months  old.  They  were  granted  leave  as  Mrs.  Oludoyi's
   dependants until 3 October 2010. Mr. Oludoyi was  a  trained  teacher  in
   Nigeria. In the United  Kingdom,  he  took  work  as  a  security  guard.
   Christianah and Samuel pursued their studies.

27. Mr. and Mrs. Oludoyi and Samuel had a previous appeal  on  human  rights
   grounds against a decision refusing their applications of 2 October  2010
   for leave on human rights grounds. Christianah did not have  a  right  of
   appeal because her  application  of  the  same  date,  which  was  lodged
   separately because she was over 18 years old by then, was rejected twice,
   the first time because no fee was paid and the  second  time  because  no
   photographs were supplied. By the time she submitted a valid  application
   (on 14 January 2011), it was out of  time.  This  application  was  still
   outstanding by the time the appeal of the other family members was  heard
   before the FtT (Judge Iqbal). The judge allowed the  appeal  because  the
   respondent  had  failed  to  consider  Christianah's   application.   The
   respondent then refused  Christianah's  application  and  maintained  the
   refusal of the applications of the other family  members,  whose  appeals
   were then heard and dismissed by Judge of the FtT Dove  QC  (as  he  then
   was).

28. Although Christianah was  not  an  appellant,  Judge  Dove  nevertheless
   considered her circumstances.

29. Judge Dove heard evidence  that  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Oludoyi  had  an  older
   married daughter who lives in Abuja in Nigeria with her husband and  with
   whom they speak on the phone from time  to  time.  They  visited  her  in
   Nigeria in 2009. Mrs. Oludoyi also had a  brother,  his  wife  and  their
   children in Nigeria. Both Mr. and  Mrs.  Oludoyi  had  relatives  in  the
   United Kingdom. The judge said that he did not consider that the  private
   lives that Mr and Mrs Oludoyi, Christianah and Samuel  had  developed  in
   the  United  Kingdom  were  particularly  weighty  matters.  Although  he
   recognised that Mrs.  Oludoyi  and  her  family  have  severed  the  vast
   majority of their ties with Nigeria, Mr. and Mrs. Oludoyi  had  an  adult
   daughter who still lived there and he considered that their private lives
   in the United Kingdom had been built up in the knowledge that  there  was
   only a temporary right to do so. He considered that there was nothing  to
   suggest that the education of Christianah and Samuel could  not  continue
   in Nigeria.

30. Mr. and Mrs. Oludoyi and Samuel were granted  permission  to  appeal  to
   the Upper Tribunal. The appeal was  heard  before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
   Storey who, in a determination promulgated on 18 April 2012,  found  that
   there was no material error  of  law.  Judge  Storey  observed  that  the
   Article 8 ground was hopeless. He also commented that, whilst he did  not
   consider that the applicants have been in the United Kingdom sufficiently
   long to be able to establish any significant ties of private life such as
   would make their return to Nigeria disproportionate, they appeared not to
   have been well-served by their legal representatives or  other  advisers.
   In the light of the fact that  Mrs.  Oludoyi  was  a  trained  nurse  who
   appeared to have an employer willing to employ her and in the absence  of
   any evidence before him to suggest that the family had been a  burden  on
   public funds or committed criminal offences or engaged in any misconduct,
   he made what he emphasised was no higher than a  "polite  request  on  an
   extra-judicial basis" to the respondent "to look again" at the case if it
   was still the case that there was a shortage of trained nurses doing  the
   type of work Mrs. Oludoyi had been doing previously.

31. The applications that are the subject of the instant claims were  lodged
   on 13 August 2012, three months after Mrs. Oludoyi (with Mr. Oludoyi  and
   Samuel as her dependants) exhausted her appeal rights on 8 May 2012.

   The challenge in each case

32. At the commencement of the hearing, I granted Mr Karim's application  to
   amend the grounds of challenge so to include a challenge to the first and
   second decisions and (in the case of the Mr Oludoyi) the third  decision.
   Mr Karim confirmed that the applicants challenge the decisions  on  their
   Article 8 claims as follows:

   (i)    Mrs Oludoyi does not challenge the decision  under  the  IRs.  She
         challenges the decision as to her private  life  outside  the  IRs.
         This is largely based on her occupation as a nurse. She also relies
         upon her good immigration history. If there is a material error  of
         law in the decisions on the Article 8  claims  of  Christianah  and
         Samuel, Mrs Oludoyi also challenges the assessment  of  her  family
         life outside the IRs.

   (ii)   Mr Oludoyi does not challenge the decision under the IRs, nor does
         he challenge the decision outside the IRs as to his  private  life.
         If there is a material error of law in the decisions on the Article
         8 claims of the other applicants, it is  contended  that  there  is
         also a material error of law in the decision outside the IRs as  to
         his right to his family life.

   (iii)  Christianah and Samuel each challenge the decisions  as  to  their
         right to private life under the IRs. They challenge  the  decision-
         maker's view, in relation to para 276ADE(vi),  that  they  had  not
         lost their ties to their home country. In this regard, the decision-
         maker said that, having lived in Nigeria for 18 years (in the  case
         of Christianah) and 15 years (in the case of Samuel)  and  "in  the
         absence of any evidence to the contrary", it was not accepted  that
         in the period of time they had respectively  spent  in  the  United
         Kingdom they had lost their ties to their home country as they  had
         other family members in Nigeria including a married sister.

   (iv)   Christianah and Samuel also challenge the decisions made  in  each
         of their cases outside the IRs as to whether there are  exceptional
         circumstances in their  individual  cases.  They  rely  upon  their
         respective relationships  with  their  partners;  in  the  case  of
         Christianah, with a Mr. Odunayo Adesina, a British citizen; and, in
         the case of Samuel, with a Miss Azuka Nnoruka,  a  British  citizen
         born in the United Kingdom. They also rely upon the fact that  they
         arrived in the United Kingdom  as  minors;  their  studies  in  the
         United Kingdom; and their good immigration history.

33. I will therefore deal first with the challenge to the  decision  outside
   the IRs on the  private  life  claim  of  Mrs  Oludoyi  followed  by  the
   challenges to the decisions on the Article 8 claims (inside  and  outside
   the IRs) of Christianah and Samuel. If there are material errors  of  law
   in any of these decisions, the impact of those errors  on  the  decisions
   made in respect of the family life claims outside the IRs of Mr  and  Mrs
   Oludoyi will need to be considered.

   Mrs Oludoyi - private life claim outside the IRs

34. The  first  decision  stated  that  the  decision-maker  had  considered
   whether Mrs Oludoyi's application raised  any  exceptional  circumstances
   and had decided  that  it  did  not.  However,  the  first  decision  was
   supplemented by the second decision. The relevant section of this  letter
   reads:

           "Exceptional circumstances

           The approach in considering Article 8 claims is  to  (a)  assess
           whether a case meets the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
           and (b) consider whether  the  case  discloses  any  exceptional
           circumstances such that refusal would  result  in  unjustifiably
           harsh consequences for the claimant such that refusal would  not
           be proportionate. This was the approach followed in  [the  first
           decision], as  described  below.  This  letter  supplements  the
           analysis described under (b),  exceptional  circumstances.  Each
           applicant is considered in turn.

          Our current guidance defines this as:


           "Exceptional" does not mean "unusual" or  "unique".  Whilst  all
           cases are to some extent unique, those  unique  factors  do  not
           generally render them exceptional. For example, a  case  is  not
           exceptional just  because  the  criteria  set  out  in  EX.1  of
           Appendix FM  have  been  missed  by  a  small  margin.  Instead,
           "exceptional" means circumstances in which refusal would  result
           in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that
           refusal of the application would not be proportionate.  That  is
           likely to be the case only very rarely."

         [Mrs Oludoyi]

         ... The [first  decision]  also  considered  whether  or  not  [Mrs
         Oludoyi's]  application]  raises  or   contains   any   exceptional
         circumstances which,  consistent  with  the  right  to  respect  of
         private and family life contained in Article 8 ...,  might  warrant
         consideration by the Secretary of State of  a  grant  of  leave  to
         remain in the  United  Kingdom  outside  the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules. The [first decision] determined that it did not.
         As explained above, this letter supplements that analysis.

         In support of your  claim  you  have  raised  the  fact  that  [Mrs
         Oludoyi] is a qualified nurse whose expertise would be of value  to
         the UK. This has been carefully considered. However,  it  has  been
         decided that a grant of leave is the rules is  not  appropriate  in
         [Mrs  Oludoyi's]  case  because  the  circumstances,  as  set   out
         previously and below, are not exceptional.

         The skills which  [Mrs  Oludoyi]  has  acquired  as  a  nurse,  are
         transferable to  other  countries  including  Nigeria,  hence  [Mrs
         Oludoyi] could continue  to  seek  work  abroad  and  exercise  her
         training outside the UK. The fact that [Mrs Oludoyi] is a nurse and
         there is a shortage of nurses in the U.K. may be a factor  to  take
         into account  when  considering  the  balancing  of  [Mrs  Oludoyi]
         Article 8 rights with other public interests  such  as  immigration
         control. However, this benefit is not considered by the SSHD to  be
         an exceptional factor which would justify a grant of leave  outside
         the Rules.

         It is noted that [Mrs Oludoyi] has extended family in the  UK:  two
         brothers-in-law, a cousin, and uncle. However, no evidence has been
         provided, nor has it been suggested by [Mrs Oludoyi] that there  is
         any relationship beyond the normal  emotional  ties  between  adult
         relations, which would justify a grant of leave outside the Rules.

         [Mrs Oludoyi], with her husband and two children, form a  unit  who
         could return to Nigeria together to continue their family  life  in
         that country. It is also noted that [Mrs  Oludoyi's]  eldest  child
         still lives in Nigeria, along with Mrs Oludoyi's brother, his  wife
         and  their  children.  It  is   considered   that   Mrs   Oludoyi's
         circumstances are not sufficiently compelling to warrant a grant of
         leave on exceptional grounds."

         (my emphasis)

35. Mr Karim submitted that the decision-maker erred  by  failing  to  adopt
   the five-step  approach  explained  in  Razgar.  He  submitted  that  the
   decision-maker   erred   in   proceeding   immediately   to   considering
   proportionality. In my judgement, this simply ignores the fact  that  the
   factor relied upon (that Mrs Oludoyi is a nurse whose work is  of  public
   benefit as it is a shortage occupation) relates to proportionality; it is
   difficult to see its relevance to the first, second and  third  steps  of
   the five-step approach. Furthermore, and in any  event,  Judge  Dove  had
   made relevant findings of fact about Mrs Oludoyi's private  life  in  the
   United Kingdom. No explanation  was  given  to  the  respondent  why  her
   private life ties to the United Kingdom  had  changed  since  Judge  Dove
   determined her Article 8 claim in April 2012. All that  had  happened  is
   that time had passed.

36. Mr Karim drew a distinction between "exceptional circumstances"  per  se
   and exceptional circumstances which lead to the grant  of  leave  outside
   the IRs. He submitted that the fact that Mrs  Oludoyi  was  a  nurse  was
   itself an exceptional circumstance. As a nurse,  she  is  in  a  shortage
   occupation. Her work is of a public benefit.

37. In drawing this distinction between "exceptional circumstances"  per  se
   and exceptional circumstances which lead to the grant  of  leave  outside
   the IRs, Mr Karim was conflating the meaning of "exceptional" in ordinary
   language and the meaning given  to  it  in  the  guidance.  The  guidance
   attributes a specific meaning to "exceptional". The guidance  defines  it
   as follows: ""exceptional" means circumstances  in  which  refusal  would
   result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual  such  that
   refusal of the application would  not  be  proportionate."  The  guidance
   therefore uses the word "exceptional" as meaning that  the  decision  (to
   refuse leave to remain/remove etc) would be in breach of the individual's
   rights under Article 8, having  weighed  the  individual's  circumstances
   against the state's interests. In other words, the guidance uses the term
   "exceptional" as shorthand for "disproportionate".

38. It is clear from UE (Nigeria) and the judgment of the House of Lords  in
   R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Bakhtaur Singh [1986] 1 WLR  910
   that the value to the community in the United Kingdom of an individual is
   a relevant consideration ([21]). The  fact  that  the  community  in  the
   United Kingdom or a part of it  would  lose  something  of  value  if  an
   individual is removed is relevant to an assessment of the extent  of  the
   public interest in removal ([24] and [35] of UE (Nigeria)). However,  the
   Court of Appeal in UE (Nigeria) also  made  it  clear  at  [36]  that  it
   expected that the factor of public value would make a difference  to  the
   outcome of immigration cases only in a relatively few instances where the
   positive contribution is "very significant", perhaps of the kind referred
   to by Lord Bridge of Harwich in Bakhtaur Singh. In Bakhtaur  Singh,  Lord
   Bridge (at page 917 C-E) referred to various  examples  of  persons  with
   such value, such as an essential  worker  in  a   company  engaged  in  a
   successful export business or a social worker upon whom a local community
   depended or a scientific research worker engaged on  research  of  public
   importance.

39. I am far from persuaded that the mere  fact  that  an  individual  is  a
   nurse and/or works in a shortage occupation is of  itself  sufficient  to
   make a difference to the outcome on account of the public  value  of  the
   work. There are many occupations  that  make  positive  contributions  to
   society. Doctors, firemen, charity workers and social workers, to mention
   just a few. Plainly, their work, as well as the work  of  nurses,  is  of
   value to the community. However, in my judgement, these are not  examples
   of cases (even if they are shortage occupations) that  are  akin  to  the
   examples Lord Bridge had in mind in Bakhtaur Singh of  cases in which the
   factor of public value would make a difference to the outcome.  I  accept
   Mr Karim's submission that the examples given by  Lord  Bridge  are  only
   examples; they are not conclusive. Nevertheless, they are  examples  that
   convey the clear message that not all work that is of public  value  will
   make a material difference to the outcome. It will only rarely do so.

40. In my judgement, when properly analysed, the real complaint advanced  on
   Mrs Oludoyi's behalf is about the weight that the decision-maker gave  to
   Mrs Oludoyi's occupation as a nurse and the benefit to the public of  her
   work. Indeed, the fact that the challenge is to the weight given to  this
   factor  by  the  decision-maker  is  evident  from  the  fact  that   the
   applicants' skeleton argument  (at  [51.i.])  specifically  states  that,
   having accepted that there is a shortage of nurses in the United Kingdom,
   the  respondent  "fails  to  attach  sufficient  weight  to  the   public
   interest".

41. A submission that a decision-maker has given  too  little  or  too  much
   weight to any particular factor does not raise any point of law. It is no
   more than an attempt to re-argue  the  merits  unless  the  challenge  is
   brought on the basis that the decision was Wednesbury unreasonable,  that
   is, that no reasonable decision-maker could have refused the claim. It is
   clear from the second decision that the decision-maker took into  account
   as a relevant consideration the value to the community of  Mrs  Oludoyi's
   work as a nurse and that this was acknowledged as a shortage  occupation.
   The weight to be given to these matters both in favour of Mrs Oludoyi and
   against her was for the decision-maker to decide. Given that it is  clear
   that the decision-maker had taken these matters into account  and  given,
   further, the  observations  in  UE  (Nigeria)  and  Bakhtaur  Singh,  the
   decision that the refusal of leave to remain in Mrs  Oludoyi's  case  was
   not disproportionate is not Wednesbury unreasonable. This  conclusion  is
   supported by the fact that in April 2012 (i.e. about two years before the
   most recent of the decisions that Mrs Oludoyi seeks to  challenge)  Judge
   Storey, who was plainly aware that she was a nurse, considered  that  the
   Article 8 claim was hopeless.

42. Mr Karim also relies upon Mrs Oludoyi's immigration history.  He  relied
   upon  para  3.2.8  of  the  respondent's  guidance  in  the   Immigration
   Directorate Instructions (IDIs) dated October 2013. Para  3.2.8  explains
   what is meant by "exceptional circumstances" which I have  quoted  above.
   Para 3.2.8 then states:

         "In determining whether there are  exceptional  circumstances,  the
         decision-maker must consider all the relevant factors, such as:

         a)   The circumstances around the applicant's entry to the  UK  and
             the proportion of the time they have been in the UK legally as
             opposed to illegally. Did they form  their  relationship  with
             their partner at a time when they had no immigration status or
             this was precarious? Family life which involves the  applicant
             putting down roots in the UK in the full knowledge that  their
             stay here is unlawful or  precarious,  should  be  given  less
             weight, when balanced against the factors weighing  in  favour
             of removal, than family life by a person lawfully  present  in
             the UK.

         b)   Cumulative factors should be considered. For example were  the
             applicant has family members in the UK but their  family  life
             does not provide a basis for stay and they have a  significant
             private life in the UK. Although under the rules  family  life
             and private life are considered separately,  when  considering
             whether there are exceptional circumstances private and family
             life can be taken into account."

43. Mr  Karim  submitted  that  Mrs  Oludoyi  "meets"  para  3.2.8  a),  the
   implication being  that  para  3.2.8  sets  out  a  requirement  akin  to
   requirements under the IRs that is either  satisfied  or  not  satisfied.
   This is misconceived, as is the notion that a good immigration history on
   the part of an individual somehow reduces (at all or to  any  significant
   extent) the weight that would ordinarily attach to the state's  interests
   in immigration control. An individual's poor immigration history can  and
   often does work against him, in that,  it  increases  the  considerations
   that pull in favour of  the  state's  interests,  if  only  to  serve  as
   deterrence to others. However, the fact that an  individual  has  a  good
   immigration history does not necessarily  reduce  the  considerations  in
   favour of the state's interests.

44. In any event, the reality is that the second decision  stated  in  terms
   that it supplemented the analysis of "exceptional circumstances"  in  the
   first decision. The first decision in Mrs Oludoyi's case referred to  the
   fact that she arrived in the United Kingdom in 2006, in  the  context  of
   para 276ADE.  In  the  section  under  "Exceptional  Circumstances",  the
   decision-maker noted that her leave to remain expired on 3 October  2010,
   that the most recent determination of her appeal was on 14 April 2012 and
   that her application for leave to remain was made on 13 August  2012.  It
   is therefore plain that the decision-maker must have  had  Mrs  Oludoyi's
   immigration history in mind when reaching the second decision.

45. Mr Karim also submitted that the decision-maker had  not  indicated  the
   weight that was given to the specific private life factors in  favour  of
   Mrs Oludoyi; in particular, her occupation as  a  nurse  and  the  public
   value of her work. This  an  empty  point,  in  my  judgement.  When  the
   decision-maker's reasons are considered as a whole, it is plain  that  he
   conducted  the  balancing  exercise  in  relation   to   proportionality,
   considering her circumstances cumulatively, and giving such weight as  he
   considered appropriate to each of the factors for and against Mrs Oludoyi
   to reach his overall conclusion.

   Christianah and Samuel - para 276ADE(vi) of the IRs

46. Christianah and Samuel each received a letter dated 9 August 2013  (i.e.
   the first decision). However, the second decision letter dealt  with  the
   claims of all four applicants; in relation  to  Christianah  and  Samuel,
   under one combined heading.

47. Para 276ADE was dealt with in the letters dated 9 August 2013  addressed
   (respectively) to Christianah and Samuel. As stated at  [32]  above,  the
   letters said that, having lived in Nigeria for 18 years in  the  case  of
   Christianah and 15 years in the case of Samuel and "in the absence of any
   evidence to the contrary", it was not accepted that in the period of time
   they had respectively spent in the United Kingdom  they  had  lost  their
   ties to their home country as they had other family  members  in  Nigeria
   including a married sister. Accordingly,  the  decision-maker  considered
   that para 276ADE(vi) was not satisfied in relation to each of them.

48. The second decision said as follows:

         "You have also claimed that the  adult  children  of  Mr  and  Mrs.
         Oludoyi, Miss Christianah Damilola Oludoyi and Mr. Samuel  Damilare
         Oludoyi have built up family life  with  their  respective  British
         partners, Mr. Odunayo Adesina and Miss Onyedika Chukwu Azuka.

         In respect of [Christianah] and [Samuel],  it  is  noted  that  the
         relationships into which they have allegedly entered do not  extend
         to cohabiting with their respective partners. Hence at this  stage,
         the relationships cannot be  interpreted  as  having  reached  that
         level of commitment demonstrated by persons living  together  in  a
         relationship akin to marriage. Furthermore, for a  relationship  to
         be recognised as genuine and subsisting, a period  of  2  years  of
         cohabitation is  taken  as  being  indicative  as  specified  under
         paragraph GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM. As neither couple were cohabiting
         on 10 August 2012, a period of two years cannot be met currently.

         [Christianah] and [Samuel] may therefore be regarded  as  having  a
         private life with their partners. However,  they  do  not  merit  a
         grant of leave outside the rules  because  they  have  supplied  no
         evidence to show  that  contact  cannot  be  maintained.  There  is
         nothing to prevent them continuing the private life that they  have
         with their partners from Nigeria. Although there may be a degree of
         hardship for [Christianah] and [Samuel] in that they would be  away
         from their alleged partners; if they were  to  return  to  Nigeria,
         there is nothing to prevent them from having contact by alternative
         methods such as telephone, Internet, letters and visits if they  so
         wish.  Similarly,  [Christianah]  and  [Samuel]  have  cited  their
         friendships  and  relationships  with  other  persons  in  the   UK
         including an uncle,  Mr  Oludoyi  and  his  three  young  children.
         However, they have again provided  no  evidence  to  indicate  they
         would be unable to maintain such friendships and relationships with
         extended family members or friends from abroad.

         [Christianah] and [Samuel] are both healthy young adults  who  have
         benefitted from studying in the UK. They have  the  opportunity  to
         continue their education in Nigeria,  or  seek  employment  on  the
         basis of the skills/qualifications they have attained.  There  does
         not seem to be any reason why it would be unreasonable for them  to
         return to Nigeria, where they have spent most of their  lives,  and
         have family and friends residing in that  country  who  could  help
         [Christianah] and [Samuel] to re adapt to life in Nigeria.

         Your clients form  a  family  unit  who  could  return  to  Nigeria
         together to continue their  family  life  in  that  country.  Their
         circumstances are insufficiently compelling to warrant a  grant  of
         leave on exceptional grounds."

49. Mr Karim referred me to the  determination  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
   Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060 (IAC). Para  4
   of the headnote states:

         "The natural and ordinary meaning of the word 'ties'  in  paragraph
         399A of the Immigration Rules imports a concept involving something
         more than merely  remote  or  abstract  links  to  the  country  of
         proposed  deportation  or  removal.  It  involves  there  being   a
         connection to life in that  country.  Consideration  of  whether  a
         person has 'no ties' to such  a  country  must  involve  a  rounded
         assessment of all of the relevant circumstances and is  not  to  be
         limited to 'social, cultural and family' circumstances."

50. It is not contended on behalf of  Christianah  and/or  Samuel  that  the
   decision-maker took into account any irrelevant matters or failed to take
   into account relevant considerations. The challenge plainly concerns  the
   weight to be given to the various matters  considered  by  the  decision-
   maker.  The  challenge  to  the  findings  of  the  decision-maker   that
   Christianah and Samuel had not lost their  ties  to  Nigeria  essentially
   concerns the weight to be given to the fact that they entered the  United
   Kingdom as minors (Christianah was 17 years 8 months old  and  Samuel  14
   years 7 months old). Para 51.iv  of  the  applicants'  skeleton  argument
   contends that the  decision-maker  erred  in  "not  attaching  sufficient
   weight" to their history, in that, they entered  the  United  Kingdom  as
   minors and spent an important part of their lives in the United  Kingdom.
   Mr Karim submitted  that  the  fact  that  Christianah  and  Samuel  have
   relatives in Nigeria does not mean that they  have  meaningful  ties.  He
   referred me to Christianah's application for leave where  (at  A124)  she
   said: "I don't have anyone in Nigeria at present".

51. I simply cannot see any error of law in the assessment of the "no  ties"
   stipulation in  para  276ADE(vi)  for  Christianah  or  for  Samuel.  The
   decision-maker has taken into account in terms the considerations  relied
   upon on their behalf. Whilst they entered the United Kingdom  as  minors,
   Christianah was just under the age of 18 and Samuel was 14 years 7 months
   old. The decision-maker was fully entitled to find that they had not lost
   their ties to Nigeria, given that they had lived in  Nigeria  from  birth
   until they were (respectively) 18 years and 14  �  years  old;  they  had
   lived there for long enough to become accustomed to life there   and  had
   not lived in the United Kingdom for long enough to have lost their  ties;
   they came to the United Kingdom to study; and they have a member of their
   immediate family (an older sister) and her  family  in  Nigeria,  not  to
   mention other more distant relatives. The mere fact that their sister was
   married does  not  mean  that  they  had  lost  their  ties  to  Nigeria.
   Christianah's bare assertion that she does not have anyone in Nigeria was
   not explained. It called for an explanation given the findings  of  Judge
   Dove about the presence of her married older sister  and  her  family  in
   Nigeria.

52.  The weight to be given to all of these various matters both  in  favour
   of Christianah / Samuel (respectively)  and  against  them  was  for  the
   decision-maker to decide. Given that it is clear that the  decision-maker
   had taken these matters into account in respect  of  each  of  them,  the
   respondent's decision that Christianah and Samuel (respectively) had  not
   lost their ties to Nigeria was not unlawful.

   Christianah and Samuel - exceptional circumstances outside the IRs

53. I shall deal first with  the  family  life  claims  of  Christianah  and
   Samuel outside the IRs.

54. It can be seen from the extract of the second decision  quoted  at  [48]
   above that the decision-maker considered whether family  life  was  being
   enjoyed in each  case;  i.e.  the  decision-maker  began  the  assessment
   outside the IRs with the first of the  five-step  approach  explained  in
   Razgar. This was the correct approach because the  assessments  of  their
   claims under the IRs (under para 276ADE) did not include an assessment as
   to whether family life was being enjoyed by them,  nor  was  family  life
   considered in the determination of Judge Dove as no evidence  of  it  was
   placed before him.

55. I accept that cohabitation is not necessary  for  a  finding  of  family
   life. I also accept  that  the  decision-maker  had  in  error  used  the
   criterion  of  two-year-cohabitation  criterion  under  the  IRs  as  the
   yardstick by which to determine  whether  their  relationships  with  Mr.
   Adesina and Miss Nnoruka, respectively, amount to family life.

56. However, the evidence  supplied  to  the  respondent  was  very  limited
   indeed. In the case of Christianah, the evidence was as follows:

   (i)    There was a very brief letter dated 4 July 2012 from  Mr.  Adesina
         in which he  said  that   Christianah  was  his  girlfriend,  their
         relationship had started in October 2010; their  relationship  "has
         been waxing stronger ever since"; and that their ultimate goal  was
         for their relationship to end in marriage.

   (ii)   There was a "sponsorship declaration" dated 12 July 2012 from  Mr.
         Adesina which was a little longer but which  still  provided  scant
         information about the strength  of  the  relationship.  Insofar  as
         relevant, it states (at [4] and [6]) that he  and  Christianah  had
         been maintaining a loving relationship as  partners  for  over  two
         years which started in October 2010; that although they do not live
         at the same address at present, they intend to reside  together  as
         man and wife after the marriage and on completion of their studies;
         and that, as soon as he finds a job, he and Christianah will  start
         to live together and make arrangements for their marriage.

   (iii)  In her application (at A124), Christianah said: "I  am  now  in  a
         relationship with a British national" and "I intend to live with my
         partner in the UK."

57. In the case of Samuel, the evidence was as follows:

   (i)    There was a "letter of  support"  dated  8  July  2012  from  Miss
         Nnoruka which described how they first met  in  school  in  October
         2008. She went on to say that they became close friends, spending a
         lot of time together during and after school hours. She  also  said
         that, as they were into the same activities, the friendship  turned
         into a relationship. She then said:

     "We started going  out  as  a  couple  in  July  2010  after  our  GSCE
             examination in year 11. Ever since I've been with him, he  has
             been really supportive, understanding and caring.  We've  been
             through  a  lot  together,  we  revise  for  our  examinations
             together, presently we are studying the similar course at six-
             form and we are hoping to go to the same  university in  order
             to keep the bond in our relationship stronger,  please  kindly
             consider his application and grant him his request in order to
             make life bearable for both of us."

     (ii)     There was a statement dated 7 August 2012 from  Samuel,  where
         he said (at [8]) of his relationship with Miss Nnoruka:

         "I am in a relationship  with  [Miss  Nnoruka]  who  is  a  British
             citizen. We have been having this relationship since 2010.  We
             met each other in September 2008. We were studying at the same
             school and at the same class. Our relationship started in July
             2010 which is continuing. We intend  to  live  together  as  a
             couple. Though we live in different addresses,  we  meet  each
             other every day as we attend the same school,  namely  Bedford
             Academy."

58.  Whilst  I  accept  that  more  information  was  provided   about   the
   relationship between Samuel and Miss Nnoruka by  Miss  Nnoruka  (Samuel's
   statement was brief) than was provided by Christianah  and  Mr.  Adesina,
   the relationships plainly could not amount to family life on any view  on
   the information provided to the decision-maker. Accordingly, the error in
   using the criterion under  the  IRs  to  determine  whether  family  life
   existed could not have made any material difference to the  issue  as  to
   whether family life was being enjoyed.

59. Accordingly,  the  decision-maker  correctly  proceeded  to  regard  the
   relationships in question  as  forming  part  of  the  private  lives  of
   Christianah and Samuel respectively.

60. Mr Karim submitted that the decision-maker erred in failing to  consider
   the human rights of Mr. Adesina and  Miss  Nnoruka;  in  particular,  the
   impact upon them of removal of Christianah and Samuel  respectively;  and
   not merely the impact of the refusal of  leave  to  them.  However,  even
   assuming (without deciding the point) that it is relevant to consider the
   impact of removal as opposed to the impact of  refuse  leave  to  remain,
   this argument is an empty one, given that: (i) the decision-maker did not
   err in finding that family life was not being enjoyed; and (ii) there was
   no evidence before the decision-maker of the impact on  Mr.  Adesina  and
   Miss  Nnoruka,  respectively,  of  having  to   maintain   contact   with
   Christianah and Samuel, respectively,  by  alternative  means  (internet,
   email, telephone etc). Mr Karim submitted  that  the  decision-maker  had
   failed to take into account the intentions of Christianah and Mr. Adesina
   to marry and likewise the intentions of Samuel and Miss Nnoruka to marry.
   However, they do not enjoy family life. They are not even engaged  to  be
   married. The view taken that they could maintain contact  by  alternative
   means is not  irrational.  It  would  be  open  to  them  to  demonstrate
   commitment to their relationships by getting engaged. If  this  happened,
   Christianah and Samuel may apply for entry  clearance  as  fianc�e/fianc�
   respectively.

61. Christianah and Samuel also rely upon the fact that they arrived in  the
   United Kingdom as minors; they  had  undertaken  studies  in  the  United
   Kingdom; and their immigration history in conjunction with para 3.2.8  of
   the IDIs, the implication being (as in the  case  of  Mrs  Oludoyi)  that
   their relatively good immigration history somehow reduces the weight that
   would ordinarily attach to the state's interest in  immigration  control,
   at all or to any significant extent. My observations at  [43]  above  are
   therefore relevant and apply equally to Christianah and Samuel.

62. Further, and in any event, the  first  decision  in  Christianah's  case
   referred to the fact that she arrived in the United Kingdom in  2008,  in
   the  context  of  para  276ADE.  In  the   section   under   "Exceptional
   Circumstances", the decision-maker noted that her leave to remain expired
   on 3 October 2010 and that her application for leave to remain  was  made
   on 13 August 2012. The decision-maker made a factual error in her case in
   stating that the most recent determination of her appeal was on 14  April
   2012. Although Judge Dove considered  her  circumstances  in  the  appeal
   determination for the other applicants, she  did  not  in  fact  have  an
   appeal; thus  her  leave  was  not  extended  under  section  3C  of  the
   Immigration Act  1971.   The  error  was  in  her  favour  and  therefore
   immaterial. The second decision specifically stated that it  supplemented
   the analysis as to "exceptional circumstances" in the first decision.  In
   all of the circumstances, it is plain that the decision-maker  must  have
   had Christianah's immigration history in mind when  reaching  the  second
   decision.

63. The same is true in Samuel's case. The first decision  referred  to  the
   fact that he arrived in the United Kingdom in 2008,  in  the  context  of
   para 276ADE.  In  the  section  under  "Exceptional  Circumstances",  the
   decision-maker noted that his leave to remain expired on 3 October  2010,
   the most recent determination of her appeal was on 14 April 2012 and that
   his application for leave to remain was made on 13  August  2012.  It  is
   therefore  plain  that  the  decision-maker  must   have   had   Samuel's
   immigration history in mind when reaching the second decision. The second
   decision specifically stated that it  supplemented  the  analysis  as  to
   "exceptional circumstances" in the first decision.

64. Finally, Mr  Karim  submitted  that  the  decision-maker  had  erred  by
   failing to indicate the weight that was given to the various  factors  in
   conducting the balancing exercise. Again, this is an  empty  point.  When
   the decision-maker's reasons are considered as a whole, it is plain  that
   he conducted the  balancing  exercise  in  relation  to  proportionality,
   considering the circumstances of Christianah  and  Samuel  (respectively)
   cumulatively, and giving such weight as he considered appropriate to each
   of the factors for and against Christianah and Samuel  (respectively)  to
   reach his overall conclusion in each of their Article 8 claims.

65. For both Christianah and Samuel, the second and third steps of the five-
   step approach were omitted but this was not material. Mr  Karim  made  no
   submissions  on  this  point  in  relation  to  Christianah  (or  Samuel)
   notwithstanding his submission on the issue of general interest  that  it
   is always necessary to consider  all  five  steps  if  there  is  a  good
   arguable case.

66. Accordingly, the decisions on the Article 8 claims  of  Christianah  and
   Samuel were not unlawful.

   Mr and Mrs Oludoyi - family life claims outside the IRs

67. It follows that the decisions on the family life claims of Mr. and  Mrs.
   Oludoyi outside the IRs were not unlawful.

   Applicants' challenges to the failure to issue appealable immigration

68. The  applicants  challenge  the  failure  of  the  respondent  to  issue
   appealable immigration decisions. As they  were  overstayers  as  at  the
   dates of the decisions they seek to challenge,  they  contend  in  effect
   that the failure to issue removal decisions  to  them  was  unlawful.  Mr
   Karim accepts that there is no obligation on the respondent  to  make  an
   appealable immigration decision to an overstayer at any particular  time:
   R (Daley Murdock) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 161. The Supreme  Court  reached
   the same conclusion in Patel and others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC  [2013]  UKSC
   72.

69. As at the dates on which the decisions were  made,  a  removal  decision
   gave rise to a right of appeal exercisable in-country if a  human  rights
   claim had been made (as did the applicants, s.92(4) of  the  Nationality,
   Immigration and Asylum Act 2002) unless certified as clearly unfounded.

70. The respondent has a policy entitled: "Request  for  removal  decisions"
   (the Removal Decisions Policy), first issued in February 2012. Insofar as
   relevant, the policy states:


       "This guidance only applies if a person:


     o has made a valid 'out of time' application for leave to remain which
       is refused
     o did not receive a removal decision when the application for leave to
       remain was refused
     o failed to leave the UK voluntarily
     o has requested in a PAP, or letter  before  action,  that  a  removal
       decision is made.


       Accepting a request for a removal decision


       This page tells you when to grant a request for a removal decision.


       The Home Office is not required to routinely make a removal decision
       at the same time as refusing leave to remain from an applicant  with
       no current leave.


       If a removal decision is not made and served alongside a decision to
       refuse of (sic) an out of time application for leave  to  remain,  a
       removal decision will be made if the applicant later requests it and
       it is appropriate to do so.


       When making a decision to accept a request, you must consider:


       .    the need to promote the welfare of children who are in the UK
           o any direct cost in supporting  the  applicant  and  dependants
             being met by the Home  Office  or  a  local  authority  (under
             section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948 or  section  17
             of the Children Act 1989), and
           o exceptional and compelling circumstances.


       You can make a removal decision  when  requested  in  the  following
       cases:


           o the  refused  application  for  leave  to  remain  included  a
             dependant child under 18 resident in the UK for three years or
             more
           o the applicant has a dependant child under the age of 18 who is
             a British citizen
           o the applicant is being supported by the  Home  Office  or  has
             provided evidence of being  supported  by  a  local  authority
             (under section 21 of  the  National  Assistance  Act  1948  or
             section 17 of the Children Act 1989), or
           o there are other exceptional and compelling reasons to  make  a
             removal decision at this time."

71. The applicants had made requests for removal  decisions  in  their  pre-
   action protocol letter. Accordingly, Mr Karim relied upon two  arguments.
   The first argument draws upon the distinction I described earlier  ([36])
   that Mr Karim had made between "exceptional  circumstances"  per  se  and
   exceptional circumstances which lead to the grant of  leave  outside  the
   IRs. He  submitted  that  the  mere  fact  that  the  decision-maker  had
   considered factors outside the IRs shows that he had accepted that  there
   were  "exceptional  circumstances"  even  if  he   concluded   that   the
   exceptional circumstances were not such as to lead to the grant of  leave
   outside the IRs. I have already rejected the distinction in  the  context
   of the guidance for the consideration of the proportionality issue in the
   assessment of Article 8 claims outside the IRs  ([37]  above).  There  is
   another reason why the argument that Mr Karim makes  in  connection  with
   the Removal Decisions Policy does  not  make  sense.  Whilst  a  specific
   meaning is given to the term "exceptional circumstances" in the  guidance
   for considering Article 8 claims is the IRs  (the  meaning  given  to  it
   essentially means  that  "exceptional  circumstances"  is  shorthand  for
   disproportionate), there is nothing in the Removal Decisions Policy which
   ascribes the same (or any) meaning to "exceptional" in  the  policy.  The
   phrase used in the policy is "exceptional and  compelling"  circumstances
   or reasons, with the decision-maker being left to decide what amounts  to
   "exceptional and compelling". For all of  these  reasons,  I  reject  the
   first argument.

72. Secondly, Mr Karim submitted that,  individually  or  together,  it  was
   unreasonable for  the  respondent  not  to  make  removal  decisions.  He
   submitted  that  the  applicants  will  not  leave  the  United   Kingdom
   voluntarily  even  if  their  judicial  review  claims   are   dismissed.
   Accordingly, they  would  be  left  in  a  limbo.  The  respondent  would
   eventually have to make removal decisions at some  point  in  any  event.
   There is no merit in the second argument, which I have no  hesitation  in
   rejecting. It is no more than an attempt to get around the  reasoning  in
   Daley  Murdock  and  Patel   (in   particular,   [27]-[29]   of   Patel),
   notwithstanding the fact that the issue in those cases  (on  the  removal
   decisions point) was whether the failure to issue a removal  decision  at
   the same time as a refusal of leave to remain was unlawful. There  is  no
   duty on the respondent to issue removal decisions to the applicants. They
   have no legal basis for remaining in the United Kingdom.  The  respondent
   is entitled to  expect  them  to  depart  voluntarily.  That  is  not  an
   irrational or unreasonable stance for her to take.

   Decision:

   The claims are dismissed.
