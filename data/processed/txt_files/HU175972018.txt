For the appellant:     Mr K Wadup, instructed by Taj Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Designated First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  McClure  promulgated  4.3.19,  dismissing  on  all
    grounds his appeal against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 9.8.18 to refuse his application made on  15.1.18  for  leave  to
    remain on private life human right grounds.

 2. Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Macdonald  granted  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal on 3.4.19.

 3. Thus the matter came  before  me  sitting  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  at
    Manchester Civil Justice Centre on 16.12.19.

 4. At the  outset  of  the  hearing,  I  was  handed  Mr  Widup's  written
    submissions, undated.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, after carefully considering  and  taking
    into account the written and oral submissions, I find no material error
    of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. In summary, the grounds  of  application  contend  that  Judge  McClure
    failed to take account of relevant case law and made a  material  error
    of fact when stating that the appellant had only been living  with  his
    uncle until he was 18 for a period of about 4 years, when  in  fact  he
    had been living with his  uncle  and  family  for  some  11  years  and
    continued to do so.

 7. In granting permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, Judge Macdonald
    observed that at [63]  of  the  decision  the  judge  stated  that  the
    appellant had been living with his uncle for a period of about 4  years
    and went on to  find  that  family  life  did  not  exist  between  the
    appellant and his uncle's family. It was considered arguable  that  the
    finding was in error of fact and one material to  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal. It was on that basis that permission was granted.

 8. There are a number of errors of chronology in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision. The appellant first came to the UK on 14.5.08, aged 12  years
    and 11 months. It is alleged  that  his  mother  left  him  behind  and
    returned to Bangladesh in August 2008, when he  was  aged  13.  He  was
    taken in  by  his  uncle  and  has  lived  with  him  ever  since.  His
    discretionary leave expired on 15.12.14, when he was 19 years  of  age.
    At the date of the application to which this appeal relates he  was  22
    and by the date of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
    29.1.19 he was 23.

 9. The judge was in error  in  stating  at  [56]  that  by  the  time  his
    discretionary leave had expired, the appellant had only been in the  UK
    for 4 or 5 years. In fact, he had by then been in the UK for some  6  ï¿½
    years. Similarly, the judge erred in stating at [57] that the appellant
    had been in the UK for a "little short of 10 years." In  fact,  by  the
    date of the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing in January 2019, he  had
    been in the UK for a little short of 11 years.

10. At [63] of the decision, the judge stated that the appellant "was  only
    living with the uncle until he was  18  for  a  period  of  about  four
    years." That was inaccurate. By the time of reaching  adulthood  at  18
    years of age in 2013, he had lived five  years  as  a  child  with  his
    uncle. He had lived a little short of a further 6 years with his  uncle
    by the date of the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing.

11. It appears to me that, despite errors in computations of age or periods
    of time, the  grounds  and  the  grant  of  permission  may  both  have
    misunderstood what the judge meant to convey at [63] of  the  decision.
    The judge certainly did not state that the  appellant  had  only  lived
    with his uncle until he reached 18 years of age, which  appears  to  be
    the basis of the argument at [6] of the grounds. What the judge clearly
    meant to indicate was the period living with the uncle until the age of
    18; the length of time of living with the uncle as a child being highly
    relevant to  the  question  of  family  life  between  them  continuing
    thereafter into the appellant's adulthood.

12. Whilst there was an error of computation, the difference was in  effect
    slight, that between "about four years" and the just over  5  years  in
    actuality. The error is not material as the judge fully  accepted  that
    the appellant has continued to live with his  uncle.  The  point  being
    made by the First-tier Tribunal at [63] is that the  family  life  with
    the uncle as a child was over a rather  short  period,  did  not  exist
    before the appellant came to the UK, and was not  the  same  as  family
    life with a parent. At the date of the appeal hearing the appellant was
    not only an adult but was 22 years of age. He is now 23. As  the  judge
    pointed out, even in respect of natural parents,  something  more  than
    mere financial support is required when  dealing  with  a  relationship
    between adult relatives. Further, the relationship  came  about  whilst
    the appellant's immigration status was always precarious  and  latterly
    has been unlawful.

13. It is clear that the judge made an anxious scrutiny of all the evidence
    and took into account all relevant  factors.  It  is  implicit  in  the
    decision that the judge accepted  that  in  principle  there  could  be
    family life between adults in  such  a  relationship,  even  after  the
    appellant reached the age of majority. The judge did not impose a rigid
    test but considered all the relevant circumstances.  I  find  that  the
    conclusion reached, that the nature of  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and his uncle at the date of  the  hearing  was  not  one  to
    engage article 8 ECHR in terms of either family or private life was one
    to which the judge was entitled to come and for  which  cogent  reasons
    have been provided.

14. In the alternative, the judge  went  on  to  consider  article  8  ECHR
    private and family life outside the Rules and  took  into  account  the
    statutory considerations under  s117B  of  the  2002  Act,  as  he  was
    required to do when assessing the human rights claim outside the  Rules
    and in  conducting  the  proportionality  balance  between  the  public
    interest in enforcing immigration control and the right to respect  for
    private and family life. At [65] the judge set out  the  considerations
    that had been taken into account and went on at [67] to  conclude  that
    even if the private or family life was sufficient to engage  article  8
    ECHR, on the facts of  the  case  the  decision  to  refuse  leave  was
    entirely  proportionate.  That  conclusion  is  sustained   by   cogent
    reasoning and is unimpeachable.

15. The remaining grounds are in reality little more  than  a  disagreement
    with the decision and an attempt to reargue the appeal. Mr Wadup argued
    that there were significant obstacles to the appellant's integration in
    Bangladesh pursuant to  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    However, it is clear from [42] to [45] of the decision the  judge  took
    into account the circumstances the appellant would face  on  return  to
    Bangladesh. The judge noted that it appeared  that  both  parents  were
    alive in Bangladesh. In addition, his grandmother was living there with
    the appellant's brother. It is difficult to see on what basis there are
    very significant obstacles to integration on return.  At  [57]  of  the
    decision the judge pointed out that the appellant is now an adult of 23
    years and has taken advantage of education in the UK, which will  stand
    him in good stead on return. The only other potential obstacle  related
    to the alleged  risk  on  return  because  of  his  father's  political
    activities. However, the judge explained that there  was  very  limited
    evidence to support that particular claim and  there  was  insufficient
    substance for the claim to be made out.

16. In all the circumstances, it is clear that this was from the  outset  a
    very weak claim for leave to remain on the basis of private  or  family
    life outside the Rules. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    inevitable and the errors in computation of ages  or  periods  was  not
    material to the outcome of the appeal.

Decision

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

                    I make no order for costs.
