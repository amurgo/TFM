                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Frazer) allowing an appeal by the  applicant
    against a decision refusing him a residence card as the  spouse  of  an
    EEA national exercising treaty rights in the UK.  In  this  decision  I
    will refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier  Tribunal,
    the applicant as the appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    respondent.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on  16  October  1993.   He
    entered the UK with a student visa on 25 April  2011,  valid  until  30
    September 2013.  On 23 June 2014 he made an application for a residence
    card.  According to the immigration history set out in the respondent's
    summary there were a number of similar applications in  2013  and  2014
    which were refused.

3.   The appellant and sponsor were interviewed about their marriage  on  16
    December 2014 and in the light of the fact there were a large number of
    inconsistent and conflicting answers, the respondent was not  satisfied
    that the marriage was anything other than a  marriage  of  convenience.
    The respondent was  also  not  satisfied  from  the  answers  given  at
    interview that the EEA national sponsor was a qualified person.

The Hearing Before the First-tier Tribunal

4.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal both  the  appellant  and
    the sponsor gave oral evidence. A bundle of documents was  produced  on
    behalf of the appellant indexed and paginated A1 to J1 and on behalf of
    the respondent a bundle indexed and paginated A1  to  H52.   The  judge
    referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Agho v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1198  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision in Papajorgi (EEA spouse - marriage  of  convenience)
    Greece [2012] UKUT 0038 confirming that the burden of  proving  that  a
    marriage was not one of convenience lay on the appellant, subject  only
    to the fact if  there  was  no  evidence  that  could  support  such  a
    conclusion, the appellant did not have to deal with the issue.

5.   The judge set out his findings and conclusions  in  [16]  -  [26].   He
    summarised his findings as follows at [26]:

         "26. Having considered all of the evidence in the round and  having
             regard to the guidance in Papajorgi (supra),  I  am  satisfied
             that  this  is  a   genuine   marriage.    There   were   some
             inconsistencies in the answers that the appellant and the  EEA
             sponsor gave at interview.  However, there is  ample  evidence
             that they have lived at the same residences  for  four  years.
             They conduct the financial affairs in their relationship in  a
             fairly sporadic way, which I find accounts for the absence  of
             regular transactions from the appellant  going  into  the  EEA
             sponsor's account.  This is because the appellant is  paid  in
             cash and operates his financial affairs  accordingly  spending
             some of the cash, giving  some  to  the  EEA  sponsor  and  on
             occasions, paying some money into her account.  The  appellant
             intended to move in with the EEA national  straight  away  and
             this accounted for the swift engagement.   I  therefore  allow
             the appeal to the extent that the marriage is not  a  marriage
             of convenience".


6.   The appeal was allowed under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

The Grounds and Submissions

7.   In the respondent's grounds it is argued  that  no  reasons  have  been
    provided for the discrepancies  given  during  the  marriage  interview
    which were considered quite major, such  as  what  happened  after  the
    wedding ceremony, whether the sponsor had an accountant, and what  they
    did for  their  wedding  anniversary.   The  judge  had  accepted  that
    documentary  evidence  addressed  individually  to  the   sponsor   and
    appellant was sufficient to show  that  they  were  living  at  several
    addresses together but in the absence of joint tenancy  agreements  the
    respondent considered that all this showed was that the  parties  lived
    at a common address.  It is  then  argued  that  the  question  of  the
    sponsor's status was not dealt  with,  and  there  was  no  finding  on
    whether  she  was  exercising  treaty  rights.   Without   this   being
    established, it could not be said that the appellant  was  residing  in
    accordance with the Regulations and his appeal could not succeed.

8.   Mr Bramble adopted the grounds in his  submissions,  arguing  that  the
    judge had failed to deal adequately or at all  with  the  discrepancies
    which had been set out  in  paras  [2]  -  [4]  of  the  decision.   He
    submitted that the fact that there was evidence of joint residence  did
    not necessarily lead to a conclusion that they  were  living  together.
    The judge had failed to give adequate reasons for his findings.

9.   Mr Edwards submitted that this was  a  plain  case:  the  discrepancies
    related to relatively minor matters and the judge had been entitled  to
    deal with them shortly.  It was fair to  assume,  so  he  argued,  that
    there had been no real issue about whether the sponsor  was  exercising
    treaty rights in the light of the judge's failure  to  deal  with  that
    issue.

Assessment of the Issues

10.  I must consider whether the judge erred in law such that  the  decision
    should be set aside.  The first challenge to the  judge's  decision  is
    that he failed to take proper  account  of  the  discrepancies  at  the
    marriage interview highlighted in the decision letter or failed to give
    adequate reasons why he did not regard them as significant.  The  judge
    set out  the  discrepancies  in  paras  [2]  -  [4]  of  his  decision.
    Different answers were given about matters such as when  the  appellant
    met the sponsor, whether it was October or November  2012,  whether  it
    was at a local bar, and then whether they saw each other again  a  week
    later at the same bar as opposed to next meeting outside a kebab  shop.
    There were differences about whether the  sponsor  had  an  accountant,
    when the appellant last visited the mosque, the time they were married,
    and what they did following the ceremony.

11.  It is without doubt  the  case  that  these  conflicting  answers  were
    capable of supporting a finding that this was a marriage of convenience
    and, in these circumstances, the onus was on  the  appellant  to  prove
    that was not in fact the case.

12.  When assessing this issue the judge considered the evidence  about  who
    had attended the wedding, noting that the appellant's mother and sister
    had come from Pakistan for  the  ceremony  [16].   He  also  noted  the
    explanation for the speed of the marriage, the  appellant  saying  that
    the reason that he proposed so soon was because he was a Muslim and, in
    his country, they did not do years of engagement. The judge  also  took
    account of the evidence about their finances at [19] - [20]  and  where
    they had been living at [21] - [23].  He noted that both the  appellant
    and the sponsor had received correspondence at the two addresses  where
    they had been living.  He took into account the fact that there were no
    letters in the bundle jointly addressed to them  but,  given  that  the
    evidence about the accommodation spanned the period  between  2012  and
    2016, he concluded that it would be reasonable to infer that they  were
    living at those addresses between those two dates.

13.  Having considered the evidence, the judge was satisfied that  this  was
    a genuine marriage.  I am not satisfied that his failure to deal at any
    greater length with the inconsistencies set out at [2] - [4] undermines
    that finding.  He was clearly aware of them, having set them out fully,
    and in [26] he referred to the fact that there were inconsistencies but
    contrasted them with the evidence that  they  had  lived  in  the  same
    residences for four years.  It was  for  the  judge  to  balance  these
    various factors and to decide whether the appellant had discharged  the
    onus of proof.  He was satisfied that he had for the reasons  he  gave.
    In summary, I am satisfied that the judge reached a  decision  properly
    open to him for the  reasons  he  gave,  having  balanced  the  adverse
    inferences that might  be  drawn  from  the  inconsistencies  with  the
    positive  inferences  from  the  other  aspects  of  the  evidence   he
    identified.  I am therefore not satisfied that he erred in law in  this
    respect.

14.  However, I am satisfied that he erred in law by not  making  a  finding
    on whether  the  sponsor  was  exercising  treaty  rights.   The  judge
    specifically said at the end of [26] that he allowed the appeal to  the
    extent that the marriage was not one of convenience, but  there  is  no
    indication why he did not go on to decide  the  issue  of  whether  the
    sponsor was exercising  treaty  rights  and  the  representatives  were
    unable to cast any  light  on  this.   The  issue  was  raised  in  the
    respondent's decision and addressed, at least in general terms, in  the
    grounds of appeal and there is nothing to indicate that this issue  was
    conceded by the respondent.  It had to be decided to determine  whether
    the appellant was entitled to a residence card.  By failing to  do  so,
    the judge erred in law.  This issue therefore remains to be determined.
     As the parties were not ready to deal with the issue  at  the  initial
    hearing, I give directions for the filing of further evidence.

15. At the resumed hearing before me the appellant produced and relied on a
    bundle  of  documents  (A)  indexed  and  paginated  (0)-(J1-2).   This
    includes a witness statement from the appellant at  0-1  dated  6  June
    2017 and further evidence relating to the sponsor's employment.

16. Mr Malik relied in particular on the  documents  at  A15-19  which  are
    payslips covering the period January  to  May  2017  showing  that  the
    sponsor has been employed by Tesco.  Her wages were paid into her  bank
    accounts (A20-28).  There is a P60 for year ending 5 April 2017 at  A29
    showing earnings during the tax year 2016-17 of �14,258.71.  There  are
    further documents at F1-H15  evidencing  the  sponsor's  employment  at
    various times in 2013-2016.  In her statement  dated  6  October  2016,
    prepared for the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, she says  that
    she has been exercising treaty rights in the UK since 2012, she is self-
    employed, has been working as a sole trader  since  November  2012  and
    during 2015-2016 she  worked  for  Tesco.   This  is  repeated  in  the
    appellant's statement of 6 June 2017 saying that the sponsor  has  been
    self-employed from October 2012 to the end of 2015 and has been working
    full-time for Tesco from November 2015  to  date  although  there  does
    appear to have been a break in the employment at some point as  at  H14
    there was a P45 showing a leaving date from Tesco on 29 August 2016.

17. Mr Avery did not seek to raise any issues with  the  appellant  or  the
    sponsor and accepted that the documentary evidence appeared to  support
    the claim that the sponsor was exercising treaty  rights.   Looking  at
    the evidence as a whole and there being no basis for a challenge to the
    validity of the documents relating to her employment with Tesco,  I  am
    satisfied that the sponsor is exercising treaty rights in the  UK.   As
    already noted there have been previous applications which were refused.
    It was clear that there was an issue between the  parties  as  to  what
    evidence had been submitted  in  support  of  those  applications  but,
    whatever the position in that respect, in the  light  of  the  evidence
    before me, I am satisfied that the sponsor is a qualified person within
    the relevant Regulations.

Decision

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  as  erroneous  in
    law.  I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal against the refusal
    of a residence card as the spouse of an EEA national exercising  treaty
    rights in the UK. No anonymity direction was  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.
