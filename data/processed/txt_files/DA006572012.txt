                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




1.   The appellant is a citizen of Iran, who was born on 1st May, 1975.   He
    claims to have arrived in the United  Kingdom,  clandestinely,  on  1st
    November, 2002 and on 5th November, 2002 he claimed  asylum  which  was
    subsequently refused on 10th  December,  2002.   He  lodged  an  appeal
    against that decision on 6th January, 2003 and on human rights  grounds
    it was allowed on 29th October, 2003.

2.   On 17th February, 2004 permission to appeal to the former Tribunal  was
    granted, but that appeal on the part of the appellant was dismissed, on
    18th November, 2004.  His appeal rights were exhausted on 7th December,
    2004.

3.   On 29th November, 2007 a fresh asylum claim and human rights claim  was
    made on behalf of the appellant, but that was rejected on 14th January,
    2008.  The appellant was not removed from the United Kingdom.

4.   On 1st October, 2010, at Blackfriars Crown  Court,  the  appellant  was
    convicted on one count of possessing a controlled drug with  intent  to
    supply and was sentenced to a period of 30  months'  imprisonment.   He
    did not appeal that conviction or sentence.

5.   On 24th November, 2011 notice of liability to deportation was faxed  to
    Her Majesty's Prison, Lindholme, where the appellant was and,  on  17th
    February,  2011,  it  was  confirmed  to  the  Home  Office  that   the
    questionnaire had been served on the appellant,  but  no  response  had
    been received.  A further notice was sent on 23rd  June,  2011  but  no
    response received.

6.   On 20th July, 2011 a medical disclaimer was faxed  to  the  prison  for
    the appellant to sign and on  28th  July,  2011  solicitors  acting  on
    behalf of the appellant submitted a letter of authority signed  by  him
    authorising disclosure of his prison medical records.

7.   On 31st August, 2011 a Section 72 Notice was sent by facsimile  to  the
    detention centre  for  service,  but  the  appellant  refused  to  sign
    confirmation.  On 9th November, 2011 the appellant claimed  asylum  and
    this was refused on 9th July, 2012.

8.   On 17th September, 2012  the  decision  notice  and  deportation  order
    dated 7th July, 2011 were served on the appellant.

9.   The reasons for the respondent's decision were  set  out  in  a  letter
    dated 18th September, 2012.  The respondent believed that Section 72 of
    the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  applied  to  the
    appellant.

10.  The appellant appealed the respondent's decision  and  his  appeal  was
    heard at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 7th November, 2012 by a panel
    of the First-tier Tribunal comprising First-tier Tribunal Judge J  W  H
    Law and Mr G F Sandall.  Part of the evidence before them consisted  of
    a psychiatric report prepared by Dr Y A Aslam dated 9th  October,  2012
    and is set out in the appellant's  bundle  at  page  57  onwards.   The
    Tribunal dismissed the appellant's appeal and application to the First-
    tier Tribunal for permission to appeal was refused.  However, when  the
    application was renewed to the Upper  Tribunal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Latter granted  permission  because,  he  was  satisfied  that  it  was
    arguable that the panel of the First-tier Tribunal may  have  erred  in
    law in its assessment of whether the appellant was able  to  rebut  the
    presumptions under Section 72 in  the  light  of  the  guidance  in  IH
    (Section 72 - particularly serious crime) Eritrea  [2009]  UKAIT  00012
    and in its approach to the assessment of the medical  evidence  in  the
    light of R (on the application of AN v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2012] EWCA Civ 521.

11.  Counsel addressed me in relation to the medical evidence,  the  subject
    of the second challenge, and drew my attention to what the Tribunal had
    said at paragraph 68.  The Tribunal  failed  at  paragraph  68  of  its
    determination, or elsewhere, to note that according  to  Dr  Aslam,  at
    paragraph 22.9 of his psychiatric report, the account of the  appellant
    was consistent with the appellant's condition as  had  been  diagnosed.
    Counsel pointed out that the doctor found that  on  the  basis  of  his
    diagnosis, the appellant may very well be an unreliable  historian  and
    noted that the report fits in with JL (medical  reports).   The  doctor
    has access  to  the  previous  medical  evidence,  to  the  appellant's
    account, and found inconsistencies in his various  accounts.   For  the
    respondent, Mr Deller suggested that the Tribunal  had  very  carefully
    avoided the classic error of making first credibility findings and then
    only subsequently considering the medical evidence  before  it.   Here,
    the Tribunal had carefully guarded against that classic error.

12.  At paragraph 81 the Tribunal found  nothing  in  the  medical  evidence
    which might provide an explanation for the discrepancy they  had  found
    in paragraph 80.  They demonstrate that they  have  carefully  examined
    the medical evidence.   He  urged  me  to  find  that  it  was  a  safe
    determination.

13.  I have concluded  that  there  is  considerable  merit  in  the  second
    challenge and I believe that in failing  to  carefully  note  what  the
    doctor had said in paragraph 22, and  in  particular  in  22.9  of  his
    report, the Tribunal have erred.  The Doctor found that the appellant's
    presentation and symptoms were not only consistent with  the  diagnosis
    of PTSD, but were also consistent  with  the  severe  and  catastrophic
    nature of the injuries and torture which the appellant had explained to
    him.  The Tribunal do not appear to have engaged with that point.

14.  I drew the representatives' attention to  paragraph  7  of  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement and both indicated to me that  not  only
    were they familiar with it. but they were content that I should  employ
    paragraph 7.2.  I indicated that I was minded, for the reasons set  out
    below, to remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal so that a  fresh
    panel could hear it afresh.  Both representatives  agreed  and  neither
    sought to persuade me otherwise.

15.  I am satisfied  that  this  is  a  case  which  falls  squarely  within
    paragraph 7 of the Senior President's Practice  Statement.   Given  the
    length of time the parties would have to wait for the matter to be  re-
    listed before  me  in  Field  House,  it  could,  conversely  be  heard
    relatively speedily  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  view  of  the
    overriding objective in forming the onward conduct of the appeal I have
    decided that the appeal shall be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for a hearing afresh before a  panel  other  than  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge J W H Law and Mr G F Sandall.
