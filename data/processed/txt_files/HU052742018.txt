                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent to whom I shall refer as "the Applicant" is a  Pakistani
    born on 6 February 1975.  On 28 October 2006 he entered with leave as a
    student.  This  leave  was  extended  on  a  number  of  occasions  and
    converted to leave as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant under the Points-Based
    Scheme.  On  10  June  2016  he  applied  for  indefinite  leave  which
    application on 7 October 2016 was varied so as to be made on the  basis
    of 10 years' continuous residence.

The SSHD's decision

 2. On 15 March 2018 the Appellant (the SSHD) refused  the  application  on
    the basis that the various errors in the Appellant's tax  returns  were
    such as to amount to conduct which having regard to the public interest
    made the grant to him of further leave undesirable.  The SSHD relied on
    paragraphs 322(5) and 276B of the Immigration Rules.

 3. On 20 February 2018 the Appellant lodged notice of appeal.  The grounds
    are general.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 4. By a decision promulgated on 16 November 2018 Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Zahed allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.  He analysed
    the content of the Appellant's tax returns for the periods covering his
    applications for further leave of 16 February 2011 and  19  April  2013
    and referred to the Appellant's amended tax return of 12 January  2016.
    The Judge noted the Appellant had commenced proceedings  in  negligence
    in the County  Court  against  his  former  accountants  and  that  the
    proceedings had been settled on the  basis  that  the  Accountants  had
    admitted liability and agreed to pay substantial damages at the monthly
    rate of ï¿½800.  The Judge referred to  the  bank  statements  which  the
    Applicant had submitted to show that he had received the earnings which
    he had claimed in his application for further leave.

 5. The SSHD sought permission to appeal.  The grounds refer to  and  quote
    from the judgments in R (Samant) v SSHD HU/6546/2016, R (Abbasi) v SSHD
    HU/13807/2016 and R (Khan) v SSHD [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).  The grounds
    make no reference to the negligence proceedings which had been  settled
    in the Applicant's favour.  On 6 December 2018 Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Andrew granted the SSHD permission to appeal.   She  found  it
    arguable that the Judge had not taken account of the  guidance  in  the
    three judicial review cases just mentioned.

The hearing in the Upper Tribunal

6.   The Applicant attended.  I explained the purpose  of  the  hearing  and
    procedure to  be  followed.   He  confirmed  his  current  address  but
    otherwise took no active part in the proceedings.

Submissions for the SSHD

7.    Ms  Cunha  for  the  SSHD  acknowledged  the  Applicant's   successful
    conclusion of the County Court proceedings    but  nevertheless  relied
    on the learning in R (Khan) especially paragraph  37(iv)  that  for  an
    applicant simply to blame his or  her  accountant  for  an  'error'  in
    relation to an historical tax return will not be the end of the  matter
    and that failure to remedy the situation itself justifies a  conclusion
    he has been deceitful or dishonest.  She referred to the length of time
    which it had taken the Appellant to realise there was a problem at  his
    accountants.  I drew her attention to the evidence in  the  Applicant's
    bundle before the First-tier Tribunal and in particular the Applicant's
    witness statement of  21  September  2018  and  the  letters  from  the
    Applicant's  erstwhile  business  partner  at  pages  108-109  of   the
    Appellant's bundle who had been the liaison with the accountants.

8.   I indicated that I did not need to hear from Mr Iqbal.

Consideration and conclusions

9.   The Applicant had been open with SSHD about difficulties with  his  tax
    affairs at the interview of which the record is to be found at  section
    J of the SSHD's bundle.  The County Court proceedings and  evidence  of
    payment of damages were before the Judge  who  referred  to  them  when
    making  his  findings  of  fact  which  findings  were  adequately  and
    sustainably reasoned. There was no suggestion  that  any  of  them  was
    perverse.

10.  In consequence I find the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not
    contain an error of law and so it shall stand.

11.  I remain puzzled why, if the Judge's decision had been read,  the  SSHD
    sought to appeal in the terms which he did and why permission to appeal
    was granted on that basis.

Anonymity

12.  There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  heard  the
    appeal consider none is warranted.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error  of
    law and shall stand.

    No anonymity direction is made.
