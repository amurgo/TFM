For the Appellant:     Mr I Khan, Ikon Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   Mr Mohammed Baig is a citizen of Pakistan and his date of birth  is  20
    June 1984.

2.   The appellant entered the UK on 14 October 2004 having been  entered  a
    student visa until 30 November  2007.   On  22  December  2007  he  was
    granted leave to remain in the UK as a student until 31  October  2008.
    On 23 April 2009 he was granted leave to remain in the UK as a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study) Migrant until 23 April  2011.   On  6  June  2011  he  was
    granted leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until 6
    June 2013.

3.   The appellant made an application on 24 June 2013 for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant  under  the  points-based  system.   This
    application was refused by the Secretary of State in a decision  of  19
    July 2013.

4.   The application was refused by the Secretary  of  State  because  there
    was insufficient evidence to establish that the  appellant  could  meet
    the maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules (hereinafter "the
    Rules") (that he had �900 in his bank account for 90  consecutive  days
    ending within 30 days of  the  application).   The  second  reason  for
    refusing the application was that there was no evidence to  corroborate
    the appellant's previous earnings.  The respondent  took  into  account
    the bank statements from the Halifax bank, but noted that the appellant
    had not supplied  bank  statements  between  16  October  2012  and  25
    November 2012 which would corroborate the evidence of pay slips.

5.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the respondent  and  his
    appeal was dismissed by a Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (herein
    after referred to as "FtT") following a hearing on  26  November  2013.
    The  determination  was  promulgated  on  9  December  2013.   The  FtT
    dismissed the appeal under the Rules  and  Article  8.   The  appellant
    applied for permission for leave to appeal which was granted  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Macleman in a decision of 9 April 2012.  Thus the matter
    came before me.

The Hearing Before the FtT

6.   The FtT found  that  the  Halifax  bank  statements  submitted  by  the
    appellant do not establish that he had sufficient funds to satisfy  the
    maintenance requirements.  The  FtT  went  on  to  conclude  that  "the
    Halifax Bank statements do satisfy the issue regarding corroboration of
    his pay slip" (see [18]).

7.   At the start of the hearing the appellant made an  application  for  an
    adjournment. The FtT considered this and made the following findings:

         "8.  At the hearing the appellant made an  application  to  adjourn
             this appeal hearing in order to  await  bank  statements  from
             abroad from the Standard Chartered Bank.  He said  that  these
             were  copies  of  those  that  he  had  already  sent  to  the
             respondent with his application but it appeared that they  had
             not considered them.  He said that in order to get  them  they
             have to be authorised by the bank director who was on holiday.
              He said that the last contact he had with  the  bank  was  on
             30.10.13.  He said that he needed time to get these statements
             from abroad and it was very difficult process.  He  said  that
             it will show the bank balance for the maintenance  is  �3,000.
             I asked him why there was delay in getting his  statement  and
             he said that he had to learn the whole process.  He sent  them
             the papers on 18.8.13 and they said it had to be in a  certain
             format.  It made  it  hard  as  the  originals  are  with  the
             respondent.  In September he sent the paperwork and  he  spoke
             to the director who said that he would get it done and he  had
             spoken to the director who had said he would get it done.   He
             last spoke to the bank on 30.10.13 when they said  they  would
             be sent in two weeks.  He then said that he was  certain  that
             they would be here by the end of November".

8.   The FtT recorded at [9] and  [10]  that  the  adjournment  request  was
    opposed by the respondent and that the bank  statements  from  Standard
    Chartered Bank were not with  the  appellant  or  in  the  respondent's
    bundle.

The Evidence Before the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal

9.   The respondent's bundle is in two parts.  It contains  the  application
    form which was completed by the appellant in which he indicates that he
    attached personal bank statements for a consecutive 90-day period.   In
    addition there are copies of the appellant's passport, the  notice  and
    grounds of appeal, pay slips and Halifax Bank statements.  There was no
    Statement of Evidence from the appellant before the FtT.

10.  The original grounds of appeal of 15 August 2013 (page 8 of 19  of  the
    appeal form) read as follows:

         "The bank statements from 16 Oct 2012 to 25 November 2012 were  not
         submitted as an error from the bank.  I have retrieved an  original
         bank statement  from  my  bank  account  already,  to  be  able  to
         corroborate from the original statement, to provide enough evidence
         that is required.


         Maintenance funds were maintained in  my  account  for  the  period
         specified, in personal savings."

11.  There is a letter from the appellant to the Tribunal which  is  undated
    but which was received on 21 November 2013.  Attached  to  this  letter
    are original Halifax Bank statements at relating to the period from  15
    October 2012 to 23 November 2012.  The letter states as follows:

         "I am writing in regards to the submission of the documents that  I
         have to order again new duplicates from abroad  in  case  I  cannot
         find the photocopies in the record (joint  savings  account  access
         statements).  In order to proceed with the case I am attaching  the
         available documents.

         As soon as the documents missing which are already on  order  again
         to be reissued are sent.  They will be made available  on  expected
         date hopefully before 26 November."

12.  There is another letter from the appellant to  the  Tribunal  which  is
    dated 21 November 2013. However, it was not received  by  the  Tribunal
    until 18 December 2013.  This  was  not  before  the  FtT.  The  letter
    attaches a document entitled the grounds of appeal to the Tribunal  and
    it reads as follows:

         ".   I object  to  the  Home  Office  decision  on  earnings;  bank
             statements were provided as per  in  the  application  as  per
             Section 245CA(c) in a separate C4 size  Tesco  envelope  glued
             under the main envelope.


         .    I object to the Home Office decision on maintenance funds I do
             comply with Section 245CA(e).  Statements  combined  submitted
             Halifax Bank as a proof of statement for account 0946410 11-00-
             84 and Standard Chartered Bank account 08061462101 Mall  Road,
             Rawalpindi.   Pakistan.   In  a  C4  envelope  has  enough  to
             maintain �900 limit.


         I can reassure there is evidence exist and will be submitted in the
         same C4 size Tesco envelope glued to the base; as soon as originals
         or duplicates are reissued with a bank's stamps I will be available
         with on the Tribunal day, along with other documents.


         Note: these documents were provided in application  therefore  must
         not be considered as fresh documents.


         Assumptions in the wrong section in the form  must  be  ignored,  I
         can't undo them ... there had been no error on  the  bank's  behalf
         must be removed ..."


13.  There is an email from the appellant to the  Tribunal  of  22  November
    2013 which reads as follows:

         "Please find enclosed the documents and a letter, as soon as I  get
         more documents I will bring them to the Tribunal before  26  or  on
         the day of the hearing".

     It is not clear what documents were attached with this email but it  is
    reasonably likely to have been the  Halifax  Bank  statements  and  the
    undated covering letter referred to by me above at [11].

14.  There is an appellant's bundle prepared for the hearing before me  with
    a covering letter of 20 May 2014.  The bundle  consists  of  34  pages.
    There is document which is referred to as the grounds of  appeal  which
    argue that  the  appellant  submitted  the  Halifax  and  the  Standard
    Chartered Bank statements with his application. It is argued  that  the
    Judge erred in failing to determine  this  issue.  The  documents  were
    missing from the respondent's bundle which was incomplete.  There  were
    other documents  missing  from  it.  It  is  asserted  that  the  Judge
    misunderstood the appellant's request for an adjournment it  was  based
    upon him being able to obtain a letter from Standard Chartered Bank and
    not the bank statements as these had  already  been  submitted  to  the
    court on 21 November 2013 and with the application.  In the grounds  it
    is asserted  that  the  question  was  not  whether  the  evidence  was
    admissible pursuant to Section 85A  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 ( "the 2002 Act") but whether  or  not  the  statements
    from Standard Chartered Bank had been submitted with  the  application.
    In the bundle at pages 28 and 29 there is  a  statement  from  Standard
    Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited showing that the account holders  are
    Shamim Ahmed Baig and Shahida Shamim Baig.  At pages 31 and 32 there is
    another statement relating to the  same  account.   The  statements  at
    pages 28 and 29 are dated 4 October 2013 and the statement at pages  31
    and 32 is dated 7 February 2014.  There is a document at page 34  dated
    5 April 2013 which  appears  to  be  a  duplicate  and  is  a  "balance
    certificate for  visa  purpose"  which  relates  to  the  account  with
    Standard Chartered.   There is a  document  at  page  30  which  is  "a
    balance confirmation and maintenance certificate" which appears to have
    been issued on 23 January 2014 which again relates to the account  with
    Standard Chartered but at the top of the document three names are shown
    namely the account holders and that of the appellant.

Conclusions

15.  The FtT did not make a finding whether the appellant  had  submitted  a
    complete set of bank statements as he was asserting in  oral  evidence.
    In my view this is an error of law that is such that I  set  aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section 12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 and I went on to remake the decision  pursuant  to
    Section 12(2)(b)(ii) of the 2007 Act.  Both parties agreed that  should
    the decision be set aside there would be no need for a rehearing.

16.  In my view the appellant's evidence and the presentation  of  his  case
    is unimpressive and lacking in credibility.  I find  that  he  did  not
    submit sufficient evidence with his application.  He did not submit the
    bank statements from Standard Chartered and  the  statements  which  he
    submitted relating to his Halifax Bank account were not complete.  I do
    not accept that the respondent's bundle is  incomplete.   I  find  that
    what is in the respondent's bundle  accurately  reflects  the  evidence
    submitted by the appellant. The evidence was insufficient which led  to
    his application being refused.

17.  The appellant's case before the FtT  was  that  he  had  submitted  the
    statements from Standard Chartered with his application,  but  he  does
    not assert this in the original grounds of appeal, but raised it at the
    hearing.  There was no witness statement before the FtT in  which  this
    was asserted.  There is nothing  in  the  application  form  itself  or
    indeed a covering letter which  would  amount  to  cogent  evidence  to
    support the appellant's  assertion  that  he  had  submitted  the  bank
    statements from Standard Chartered.  He first raised this  issue  in  a
    document entitled grounds of appeal which was attached with the  letter
    to the Tribunal which appears to be dated 21 November 2013 but for  one
    reason or another was not received by the Tribunal  until  18  December
    2013 (after the date of the hearing before the FtT).   The  appellant's
    case is that he had to make contact with the bank again in Pakistan  in
    order for them to reissue copy statements and that these were  obtained
    and submitted to the Tribunal on 21 November 2013 (the originals having
    been submitted with the application and  mislaid  by  the  respondent).
    This is not credible and I do not accept his evidence.

18.  I find that the documents pertaining to  Standard  Chartered  were  not
    before the decision maker or the FtT.  I do not accept that  they  were
    sent to the Tribunal with any of the correspondence from the appellant.
    I find that the first time the statements have  been  produced  by  the
    appellant was in the appeal bundle which was prepared for  the  hearing
    before me of 20 May  2014.   There  is  no  cogent  evidence  that  the
    statements were submitted at any time before this.  (I  note  that  the
    bank statements at pages 31 and  32  of  the  appellant's  bundle  were
    issued on 7 February 2014 and could not have been  submitted  with  the
    letter of 21 November 2013.)  That the  respondent  accepted  that  the
    appellant had earned a certain amount during the relevant  period  does
    not lead me to infer that there were additional documents submitted  by
    the appellant and omitted from the respondent's bundle.

19.  The appellant accepted in the original grounds of appeal  that  he  had
    not submitted bank statements from 16 October 2012 to 25 November 2012.
    In my view he was clearly referring to the Halifax Bank statements.   I
    find that the appellant submitted the missing Halifax  Bank  statements
    with the undated letter to  the  Tribunal  which  was  received  on  21
    November 2013

20.  The FtT recorded the appellant's  application  for  an  adjournment  at
    [8].  The appellant now appears to be saying that he had asked  for  an
    adjournment  in  order  to  obtain  the  letter  (at  page  30  of  the
    appellant's bundle) and not in order to obtain bank statements  because
    he had already submitted these with his letter of 21 November 2013 (and
    indeed his application).  This is wholly lacking in credibility.  It is
    very clear to me that the appellant applied for an adjournment in order
    to obtain the bank statement from Standard Chartered because he had not
    to date submitted these.  The FtT made a clear and detailed  record  of
    the application  and  there  is  no  reason  to  conclude  that  it  is
    inaccurate.

21.  The appellant is not able to satisfy  the  maintenance  requirement  of
    the Immigration Rules.  The Judge failed to engage with the appellant's
    evidence; however, in my view the evidence before  the  decision  maker
    was an  incomplete  set  of  Halifax  Bank  statements  which  did  not
    establish that he would satisfy the  maintenance  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

22.  The FtT also fell  into  error  in  taking  into  account  the  Halifax
    statements which were submitted by the appellant post the date  of  the
    application  which  led  to  a  finding  that  he   had  satisfied  the
    requirements of the Rules in  relation  to  previous  earnings.   I  am
    unable to admit the statements in evidence pursuant to section  85A  of
    the 2002 Act and the appellant does not satisfy the requirements of the
    Rules relating to previous earnings.

23.  Mr Khan submitted that in the alternative the appeal should  have  been
    allowed pursuant to the policy on evidential flexibility.  And he  also
    referred to paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules.   His  submission
    is misconceived.  Not only must it be considered in the light of SSHD v
    Rodrigues [2014] EWCA Civ 2, but what Mr Khan appears to be  asking  me
    to do is  find  that  the  appellant  should  benefit  from  evidential
    flexibility in the event that his account is found to be wholly lacking
    in credibility.  It is not the appellant's case that the documents were
    missing or in the wrong format.  His evidence is that the documents  as
    required were submitted with the application and I do not accept  this.
    In any event  I  cannot  see  how  paragraph  245AA  could  assist  the
    appellant in relation to the bank statements  from  Standard  Chartered
    Bank.  There was no reason why the decision maker would have been aware
    from the appellant's application  that  he  had  a  bank  account  with
    Standard Chartered Bank.  I also note that the bank statements are  not
    in the appellant's name and the document on  which  the  appellant  now
    seeks to rely (page 30 of his bundle) does not establish  that  he  has
    access to the funds in the bank account.

24.  There was no challenge to the  decision  of  the  FtT  to  dismiss  the
    appeal under Article 8 and in my view there is no reason to  go  behind
    his findings and conclusion in relation to this.

The Decision

25.  The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

26.  The appeal is dismissed under Article 8.
