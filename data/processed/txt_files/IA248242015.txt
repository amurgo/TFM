Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Chowdhury, Counsel, instructed by KC Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Armstrong, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Robinson (the judge), promulgated on 25  November  2016,
    in which he dismissed her appeal on all grounds.  That appeal  followed
    from  the  Respondent's  decision  of  23  June  2016,   refusing   the
    Appellant's human rights claim.  The claim had been based on Article 8,
    specifically in respect of the Appellant's relationship with a  British
    citizen partner and their British citizen child.




The judge's decision

 2. The Respondent was unrepresented  at  the  hearing  before  the  judge.
    Although it is somewhat unclear from the  decision  itself,  the  judge
    appears to have concluded that the Appellant could not satisfy  any  of
    the provisions of the Article 8-related  Immigration  Rules.   He  then
    went on to assess the claim outside the context  of  those  Rules.   He
    makes reference to the best interests of the  child  and  then  to  the
    question of whether it would be reasonable for the Appellant's child to
    leave the United Kingdom and go to Bangladesh.  He sets out a number of
    factors which he concluded weighed in favour of a departure  from  this
    country, having regard to specific matters  relating  to  the  family's
    circumstances, and to factors  arising  out  of  section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   Importantly,  there  is
    what amounts to a finding of fact  that  the  Appellant's  child  is  a
    British citizen (paragraph 32).




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 3. The succinct grounds of appeal assert that the judge had failed to take
    any or any adequate cognisance of the child's British nationality  when
    assessing  best  interests  and/or  the  question  of   reasonableness.
    Despite some of the observations made by the judge in his decision, the
    grounds assert that EX.1 under Appendix FM was in fact a live issue  at
    the hearing.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Lambert
    on 10 July 2017.




The hearing before me

 5. At the outset of the hearing I indicated to both  representatives  that
    in my view there was a material error of law in the  judge's  decision,
    namely  a  failure  to  substantively  consider  the  child's   British
    nationality  when  assessing  both  best  interests  and,  importantly,
    whether it would be reasonable for  that  child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  There was no opposition to this view from Mr Armstrong.

 6. I conclude that there are indeed material errors of  law.   My  reasons
    for this conclusion are as follows.

 7. It is true that the judge has referred to the  best  interests  of  the
    child and then to the reasonableness question.  It is true also that he
    has had regard to a number of factors which would be  relevant  to  his
    assessment: for example, the nature of the ties  of  the  Appellant  to
    Bangladesh; the child's age; and the ability of one or both parents  to
    find employment in Bangladesh.

 8. However, the problem arises out of the  consideration  of  the  British
    nationality.  In light not only of well-known case-law,  but  also  the
    Respondent's guidance on Appendix FM (1.0b, August 2015,  at  paragraph
    11.2.3), a child's British nationality is a highly  significant  factor
    in assessing not only best interests but  also  the  reasonableness  of
    them leaving the United Kingdom.  With respect to the judge,  he  fails
    to engage with this factor in any meaningful  way.   The  reference  to
    nationality in paragraph 32 is simply a statement  of  his  finding  of
    fact: there is nothing more by way of substantive consideration as part
    and parcel of the best interests and/or reasonableness assessment.

 9. It may well be that the Respondent's guidance was not  brought  to  the
    judge's attention at the hearing. It certainly does not appear  in  the
    reasons for refusal letter. Whilst I have sympathy  for  the  judge  in
    this respect, the guidance was nonetheless a relevant  factor.  I  note
    that the same guidance was considered by the Upper Tribunal in  SF  and
    others (Guidance, post-2014 Act) Albania [2017] UKUT  00120  (IAC).  As
    with the present case, the document had not been brought to the judge's
    attention, but the Tribunal deemed it to be material to the question of
    whether there was an error of law.

10. The error is clearly material and therefore I  set  aside  the  judge's
    decision.



Re-making the decision

11. Both representatives agreed that in light of my decision on  the  error
    of law, I could and should remake the decision based upon the  evidence
    before me.

12. Mr Chowdhury asked me to consider the claim within the context  of  the
    Rules on the basis that the Appellant was and is  the  fianc�e  of  her
    British citizen partner.  If this were the  case  I  could  go  on  and
    consider the case under EX.1.  In Mr Chowdhury's submission it would be
    unreasonable to expect  the  Appellant's  child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  If the Appellant could not rely upon the Rules, I  was  asked
    to consider the case at large, particularly in light of section 117B(6)
    of the 2002 Act.  The child was a qualifying  child  and  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect him to leave this country.

13. Mr Armstrong sought to suggest that the  Appellant  could  go  back  to
    Bangladesh and make an entry clearance application.  I pointed out that
    I was unclear as to how this was relevant to the  question  of  whether
    the Appellant's child could reasonably leave the  United  Kingdom.   Mr
    Armstrong did not provide a response to this.   He  accepted  that  the
    child was British, having regard to what the judge  had  said  together
    with pages 7 and 8 of the Appellant's bundle.  I raised  the  issue  of
    the Respondent's guidance (referred to above) and the decision  in  SF.
    Mr Armstrong did not seek to resile from the contents of that guidance.
     He asked me to consider the wider public interest considerations,  and
    to dismiss the appeal.

14. In reply Mr Chowdhury asked me to note that  the  Appellant  is  now  8
    months pregnant with her second child.  He accepted that she could  not
    meet the five-year route under Appendix FM.




Findings

15. I have had regard to the evidence contained in the Respondent's bundle,
    and the Appellant's bundle, indexed and paginated 1-53.  There has been
    no challenge to the credibility of any of the evidence before  me,  and
    indeed there does not seem to have been any  factual  disputes  between
    the parties previously.  I make the following findings of fact.

16. The Appellant came to the United  Kingdom  in  2013  with  leave  as  a
    student until 9 May 2015.  She then made  an  in-time  application  for
    further leave to remain which resulted  in  the  Respondent's  decision
    against which she now appeals.  I find that the Appellant has been in a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with her British  citizen  partner,
    Mr G, since 2014, and that they began living together in March of  that
    year.  I find that the Appellant and Mr G converted to Islam on 1 March
    2016.  I find that on the  same  date  they  entered  into  an  Islamic
    marriage.  I find that the couple's son, C, was born in December  2015.
    I find that both Mr G and C are British  citizens.   I  find  that  the
    Appellant has family ties back in Bangladesh.  I find that  she  is  an
    educated person, with a degree obtained in this country.  I  find  that
    the child has no particular health problems.  I find that the Appellant
    has at all material times been the fianc�e of Mr G.   On  the  evidence
    before me it is clear that they have been in a  committed  relationship
    for a significant period of time and have always held the intention  of
    living together permanently and of entering into a civil marriage.  The
    Islamic marriage, their cohabitation, the birth of their child, and the
    ongoing nature of the relationship all goes to show that  this  is  the
    case.  I find that although the minimum income  threshold  set  out  in
    Appendix FM cannot be met, the Appellant herself  has  been  adequately
    maintained by  her  partner,  with  reference  to  the  Income  Support
    comparator.




Conclusions on the Article 8 claim within the context of the Rules

17. I conclude that the Appellant can rely on the provisions of Appendix FM
    in this case.  Mr G is her "partner" within the meaning of GEN.1.2(iii)
    of the Appendix because he was at all material times her fianc�e.

18. No suitability issues arise in this case.

19. It has been accepted by Mr Chowdhury that  the  financial  requirements
    cannot be met, and so the Appellant would need to meet the requirements
    of EX.1 in order to succeed in her case.

20. The Appellant clearly has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with
    her child.  The child is under the age of 18  and  is  present  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He is also a British citizen.

21. The question is then whether it would be reasonable to expect the child
    to leave the United Kingdom.   In  answering  this  question  I  direct
    myself to the cases of  MA  (Pakistan)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705  and  AM
    (Pakistan) [2017] EWCA Civ 180.

22. I then have regards to the following matters:

           i. the child's best interests are a primary consideration;

          ii. it is in the child's best interests to be with his parents;

         iii. the child's  British  nationality  is  a  highly  significant
              factor, bringing with it rights and privileges which he would
              not enjoy if he were to have to live in Bangladesh;

          iv. in light of iii, the  child's  best  interests  also  lie  in
              remaining in his country of nationality;

           v. the Respondent has a stated  position  on  her  view  of  the
              reasonableness of expecting a  British  child  to  leave  the
              United Kingdom (the guidance referred to previously);

          vi. the child is still of course very young;

         vii. he was born at a  time  when  his  mother's  status  in  this
              country was precarious (although  she  had  never  been  here
              unlawfully);

        viii. there are familial ties in Bangladesh;

          ix. the Appellant is able to speak English to a reasonable level;
              there is no criminality in this case;

           x. although the minimum income threshold cannot  be  met,  I  am
              satisfied that the family  unit  is  financially  independent
              having regard to an 'adequacy' test;

          xi. there are no adverse health issues in this case;

         xii. Mr G is British.

23. I place significant weight upon the position adopted by the  Respondent
    herself in the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 35 of MA  (Pakistan).   I
    also place significant weight  on  the  Respondent's  own  guidance  at
    paragraph 11.2.3. The passage reads:



         "Would it be unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to
    leave the UK?


         Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker must not
         take a decision in relation to the parent or primary carer of a
         British Citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to
         force that British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age of
         that child. This reflects the European Court of Justice judgment in
         Zambrano.


         The decision maker must consult the following guidance when
         assessing cases involving criminality:
         ( Criminality Guidance in ECHR Cases (internal)
         ( Criminality Guidance in ECHR Cases (external)


         Where a decision to refuse the application would require a parent
         or primary carer to return to a country outside the EU, the case
         must always be assessed on the basis that it would be unreasonable
         to expect a British Citizen child to leave the EU with that parent
         or primary carer.


         In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to the
         parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the UK with
         the child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence of a
         genuine and subsisting parental relationship.


         It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where the
         conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to considerations
         of such weight as to justify separation, if the child could
         otherwise stay with another parent or alternative primary carer in
         the UK or in the EU. The circumstances envisaged could cover
         amongst others:
         ( criminality falling below the thresholds set out in paragraph 398
         of the Immigration Rules;
         ( a very poor immigration history, such as where the person has
    repeatedly and    deliberately breached the Immigration Rules."
                                                 (underlining added)

24. This particular guidance was  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  SF.  Mr
    Armstrong has not sought to suggest that the guidance does not apply in
    this case, or there are some other reasons  as  to  why  it  should  be
    ignored or otherwise  deemed  irrelevant.   In  my  view  the  guidance
    represents the considered view of the Respondent, and  whilst  this  is
    not a decisive matter, it is clearly something that I  am  entitled  to
    attach significant weight to.  It emanates from the very  source  which
    has established the framework for considering Article  8  cases  within
    the context of the Rules, with such Rules being deemed consistent  with
    Article 8 obligations.  There is no  criminality  or  other  misconduct
    which would represent significant countervailing factors here.

25. I take full account of the importance of the powerful  public  interest
    in maintaining effective immigration control.  In this  case,  however,
    this significant factor is outweighed by the matters  I  have  set  out
    previously.

26. In light of all the relevant factors in this case I  conclude  that  it
    would not be reasonable for the British  citizen  child  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.

27. As I have concluded that it would be unreasonable for  the  Appellant's
    child to leave the United Kingdom, she satisfies the provisions of EX.1
    under Appendix FM.  In light of this, the Appellant herself succeeds on
    Article 8 grounds within the context of the Rules (there  has  been  no
    suggestion that she need show anything over and above such satisfaction
    in order to succeed).



Conclusions on the alternative scenario

28. If I were wrong about Mr G  being  a  partner  within  the  meaning  of
    GEN.1.2, I would nonetheless conclude that the Appellant could  succeed
    in her appeal with reference to section 117B(6) of the 2002  Act.   The
    reasonableness test is the same under this provision as under EX.1.   I
    would rely on all factors  referred  to  above.   The  only  additional
    matter would be the Appellant's inability to meet the  requirements  of
    the Rules.   I  would  take  this  into  account  as  weighing  in  the
    Respondent's favour.  However, this would not be sufficient to outweigh
    the  matters  resting  in  the  Appellant's  side  of  the  scales,  in
    particular the Respondent's guidance.  The Appellant would  succeed  on
    this alternative basis as well.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of law.

I set aside that decision.

I remake the decision in this appeal by allowing the  appeal  on  the  basis
that the Respondent's decision to refuse the Appellant's human rights  claim
was unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.



No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award. The Appellant has succeeded in her appeal on  the  basis  upon  which
the original application was made. The Respondent has failed to have  regard
to her own guidance  when  assessing  that  application  and  resisting  the
appeal thereafter.
