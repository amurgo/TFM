                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer against the  decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Ruth)  who  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 10th January 2014 allowed the appeals of the  Appellants
    against the refusal of their applications to enter the  United  Kingdom
    as dependent children  of  the  Sponsor,  Ms  K  H,  a  person  holding
    indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

 2.  Whilst  this  is  an  appeal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  for
    convenience I shall refer to the parties in this determination as  they
    appeared before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. This appeal is subject to an anonymity  direction  that  no  report  or
    other publication of these proceedings or any part  or  parts  of  them
    shall name or directly or indirectly identify the claimant.   Reference
    to the claimant may be by use of his initials but not by name.  Failure
    by any person, body or institution  whether  corporate  or  incorporate
    (for the avoidance of doubt to include either party to this appeal)  to
    comply with this direction may lead to  a  contempt  of  Court.    This
    direction shall continue in force until the Upper Tribunal (IAC) or  an
    appropriate Court lifts or varies it.  I have made such a direction  as
    the Appellants concerned are minors.

The background to the appeal:

 4. The Appellants are citizens of Somalia born on 27th November  1999  and
    30th December 1997 respectively.  They are the minor  siblings  of  the
    Sponsor, Ms KH,, who has indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 5. On 21st January 2013 the Appellants  made  applications  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom for settlement as dependants of the Sponsor.

 6. The applications were considered by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in
    Nairobi and were refused without interview on 23rd January 2013.   The
    notice of immigration decision in respect of both  Appellants  were  in
    identical terms.  It was stated that whilst it was accepted  that  both
    Appellants were related to the Sponsor and that she was  their  sister,
    having submitted DNA evidence to confirm the  relationship,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the family circumstances  were
    as stated.  The decision letter went on to state that:-

          "You state that you have been living in Ethiopia for one year  and
         it is unclear from the documents submitted  who  in  fact  you  are
         living with in Ethiopia.  Although you state you do not know  where
         your mother and father are,  you  have  submitted  no  evidence  to
         satisfy me this is the case.  You claim you last saw  your  Sponsor
         five years ago and there is no evidence to  suggest  that  she  has
         been a primary carer for  you  throughout  the  years.   I  do  not
         consider your circumstances in Ethiopia are exceptional in relation
         to those of other  children  living  there.   Based  on  the  above
         information, I am  not  satisfied  you  meet  the  requirements  of
         paragraph 297(i)(f) of HC 395.

         As evidence of financial assistance, you have submitted three  poor
         quality, unendorsed money transfer receipts.  I  am  not  satisfied
         these documents show adequate evidence that your Sponsor  has  been
         supporting you financially and consider such recent receipts merely
         an attempt to bolster your application.

         I must also take into account  the  maintenance  and  accommodation
         aspect of your application.  It is noted you have  applied  for  an
         entry clearance with another child and your Sponsor in the  UK  has
         another two young children to support.  Your Sponsor is a  cleaner,
         earning a very modest income and is in receipt  of  child  benefits
         and working and child tax credits.  As a result, I am not satisfied
         your Sponsor will be able to maintain and accommodate  you  without
         extra recourse to public funds (297(iv), (v)).

         I  have  therefore  refused  your  application  because  I  am  not
         satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you  meet  all  of
         the requirements of the relevant paragraph of  the  United  Kingdom
         Immigration Rules."

 7. The Appellants  sought  permission  to  appeal  the  decisions  of  the
    Respondent and the appeals came before the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Ruth) on 4th December 2013.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal:

 8. In a determination promulgated on 10th January 2014, Judge Ruth allowed
    their appeals.  The judge set out the documentation at [8-10]  and  the
    findings and reasons are set out at [14-28].

 9. The judge accepted her evidence that she  had  left  her  siblings  and
    mother in Somalia when she had left that  country  to  seek  asylum  in
    2005.  Following her departure, the Appellants and  their  mother  (the
    father not having been involved with the family for many years and  his
    whereabouts being unknown) were separated during  fighting  in  Somalia
    and the Appellants were taken by neighbours to Ethiopia  with  a  large
    number of the Somalis fleeing the violence at the time.  They  had  not
    had any contact with their mother since they were separated during  the
    fighting in Somalia and her whereabouts are unknown.  The judge further
    accepted that the Sponsor was not aware of the whereabouts of either of
    the Appellants until a person she had known  when  she  herself  was  a
    refugee in Ethiopia,  contacted  her  to  say  that  she  believed  her
    siblings were there with other Somalis.  In 2011, around three or  four
    months after the Appellants fled Somalia to Ethiopia, the Sponsor  made
    contact with them over the telephone and arranged for them to live in a
    room in Ethiopia through the same friend.  The judge accepted, contrary
    to the matter set out in the refusal letters,  that  the  Sponsor  sent
    money regularly to her friend for the Appellants and  from  that  money
    their rent, daily living costs and a small amount to  pay  for  private
    tuition was covered as they did not attend school.  The  amount  varied
    to approximately US$200 or US$300 per month.

10. The judge considered the circumstances in which  they  were  living  at
    [17] and found that it consisted of a room with mattresses on the floor
    and bags for their clothing.  It was a room in a house  that  had  five
    other bedrooms each of which contained a family  and  that  the  family
    shared one toilet and bathroom.  She described that:-

         "Cooking was done outside the house and water is  supplied  from  a
         tap outside the house.  The house does  have  electricity  and  the
         children are cared for by the  Sponsor's  friend,  Safi  Omar,  who
         cooks for them and generally looked  after  them.   The  Appellants
         have no family members in Ethiopia as far as they know."

11. The judge at [19] considered the money transfer receipts at page 61  of
    the bundle and accepted that whilst the  Appellants  had  not  provided
    evidence that they are not in contact with their mother, the judge  did
    not find that there was any evidence they  could  supply  to  establish
    this and the judge recorded that there was no reason to doubt the money
    transfer receipts even though they were of poor quality.

12. The judge, when dealing with paragraph 297(i)(f) noted that it was  not
    disputed that the Appellants are the siblings of the Sponsor  and  that
    the Sponsor was present and settled in the country.  The judge made  an
    overall finding at [22] that the current situation of the two children,
    living with strangers in a crowded accommodation where they shared very
    limited facilities and do not attend school, and also having no contact
    with family members at all,  made  their  exclusion  undesirable.   The
    judge found at [23] their only known relative was living in the  United
    Kingdom and that she  had  arranged  for  her  landlord  to  give  them
    approval for them to live with her and had been financially  supporting
    them since 2011.  The judge found that in the credible absence  of  any
    contact with  the  mother  or  other  family  members,  and  given  the
    situation in Somalia at the time of their flight to Ethiopia, that  the
    judge   considered   there   were   serious   and   compelling   family
    considerations which made their exclusion from the UK undesirable.

13. The judge therefore found overall that  the  Appellants  satisfied  the
    requirements of paragraph 297(i)(f) of the Immigration Rules.

14. Dealing with the issue of maintenance, at [18] the judge recorded  that
    at the date of the decision the Sponsor was working as a  cleaner  with
    two jobs and was also in receipt of child and working tax credit.   She
    lived in a four bedroomed home for which she paid �200  per  week  rent
    and lived there with her own two minor children.   The  judge  recorded
    that at the date of the decision the Sponsor  was  earning  on  average
    �1,700 per month of a total income of which she sent the equivalent  of
    US$200 or US$300 per month to the Appellants.  The judge  concluded  at
    [27] that having taken into account the documentation that disregarding
    documents relating to the Sponsor's self-employment as this was not her
    main source of income until after the date of decision, that her income
    was on average �1,700 per month from all sources.  At  [28]  the  judge
    recorded:-

         "She  must  be  able  to  establish  that  after   the   costs   of
         accommodation she  would  have  the  equivalent  amount  she  would
         receive if entitled  to  income  support.   A  single  parent  with
         dependent children is entitled to income support in the  amount  of
         �129.83 per week.  After the Sponsor's weekly rental  payments  are
         taken out of the calculation, her income remaining is approximately
         �225 per week.  As this amount is more than she  would  receive  in
         income support, it is adequate."

    Thus the judge found that the Appellants could satisfy the  maintenance
    requirements.

15. As to accommodation, at [18] the judge recorded that the Sponsor  lived
    in a four bedroomed home for which she paid  �200  per  week  rent  and
    lived there with her  own  two  minor  children.   At  [19]  the  judge
    recorded there was a letter from the Sponsor's landlord and  a  tenancy
    agreement and at [23] recorded that the Sponsor had  arranged  for  her
    landlord to give his approval for them to live with her.  At  [25]  the
    judge said this:-

         "As for accommodation, I note at the date of decision the Appellant
         was renting a room in a four bedroom property for which the tenancy
         agreement is in the bundle (in evidence she referred to a different
         property which she would rent in the event the children came to the
         UK but that is postdecision evidence and I  do  not  take  it  into
         account).  The landlord confirms in his letter that he  would  have
         no objection to the Appellants taking over  another  room  in  this
         house and given the tenancy  agreement  appears  to  be  a  rolling
         tenancy with weekly rent of �200, I am satisfied the  accommodation
         is available and would be  occupied  exclusively  by  the  children
         without being overcrowded.  The Appellants  therefore  satisfy  the
         requirements of paragraph 297(iv) of the Immigration Rules."

16. On 2nd April 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Heynes)  granted  the
    Entry Clearance Officer permission to appeal.   The  reasons  for  that
    decision are as follows:-

         "The Grounds of Appeal complained that the  judge  failed  to  give
         adequate reasons for finding that the maintenance and accommodation
         requirements of paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules were met.

         The issue in relation to maintenance is arguable because the amount
         required to live on is not income support alone but a  figure  that
         embraces the benefits which flow from an award of income support."

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal:

17. On the 3rd June the appeal came before  the  Upper  Tribunal.  At  that
    hearing Mr Scott appeared on behalf of the Appellants and Mr  Avery  on
    behalf of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.  The  issue  related  to  the
    findings of fact made in respect of maintenance and accommodation under
    paragraph 297(iv).

18. On behalf of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Mr  Avery  set  out  the
    challenges made by the Respondent to the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Firstly in regard to the issue of  accommodation,  Mr  Avery
    submitted that there appeared to be confusion in the  determination  of
    the  judge  and  referred  the  Tribunal  to  paragraph   25   of   the
    determination where the judge recorded that at the date of the decision
    the Appellant was renting a room in  a  four  bedroomed  property,  and
    therefore was stating that the Sponsor had access to one bedroom  in  a
    four bedroomed property. The judge referred to evidence that there  was
    no objection from the landlord to having  another  room  (at  paragraph
    [25]) but at paragraph [18] the judge recorded that she lived in a four
    bedroomed home for which she paid �200 per week rent  and  lived  there
    with her own two minor children.  Thus there was a contradiction in the
    evidence concerning the nature of the accommodation at  paragraph  [18]
    and [25].  As to page 67 of the Appellants' bundle, which appear to  be
    the only document from the landlord, this letter did not  confirm  that
    another room would be available and thus it was not  known  where  that
    evidence came from unless it was the oral evidence of the Sponsor.   Mr
    Avery submitted that the judge did not take into account  the  adequacy
    of the accommodation and the judge should have had regard to it.

19. In respect of maintenance, Mr Avery submitted that there had been  very
    little reasoning in the determination.  At paragraph [27] the judge did
    not set out what the evidence was and at [28] began with an  assumption
    that was fundamentally flawed.  He submitted that the  judge  had  used
    the figure of �129.83 per week to represent  the  figure  of  a  single
    parent with dependent children would be entitled to income support  for
    that amount.  He submitted that there  had  been  no  documents  placed
    before the Tribunal to set  out  what  the  income  support  and  other
    benefit levels were and that the figure given  by  the  judge  did  not
    accord with the figures given from the DWP for 2013.  A  single  parent
    would be �71.70 and each dependent child would be �65 giving a total as
    there would be four children of �331.70 and a  family  premium  of  �17
    giving a total figure for income support and other benefits of �348.70.
     As to the income, the judge calculated it to �1,700 per month from all
    sources.  Mr Avery submitted that that was not the figure that  he  had
    calculated but in any event she could not succeed when considering  the
    test in KA and Others (Pakistan) [2006] relating to adequacy of income.



20. Mr Avery also highlighted a further issue that the income assessment at
    page 52 of the bundle relating to  2012-2013  was  significantly  lower
    than the payslips and on the face of it, it looked as  if  the  figures
    and the payslips were inconsistent as 2012-2013 gave a figure of �6,657
    whereas from the payslips from her two jobs it came to �8,000.28.

21. At this stage in the proceedings, it became clear  that  despite  legal
    authority from the Tribunal that in an entry clearance  case  involving
    the issue of adequacy of maintenance, it would  assist  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, or on appeal the  Upper  Tribunal,  as  part  of  submissions
    calculations are supplied which  reflect  the  comparison  between  the
    applicants' and Sponsor's combined projected income if the  application
    for entry clearance was in the United Kingdom  and  on  the  other  the
    amount required to provide the maintenance at a level that can properly
    be called adequate (see Ahmed (benefits: proof  of  receipt;  evidence)
    [2013] UKUT 00084 (IAC)).  It was plain from the submissions from  each
    advocate that no such  schedule  was  provided  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal nor has any such schedule been put before  this  Tribunal.   I
    therefore invited the parties to provide figures for  such  a  schedule
    and if the parties could not agree as to the figures then the  Tribunal
    would then hear from each of them as to where the dispute was.

22. At the conclusion of their discussions,  Mr  Avery  presented  what  Mr
    Scott agreed were the figures.  As to the Sponsor's income, she had two
    jobs as a cleaner.  The first with GM from  the  payslips  she  had  an
    income of �185  per  fortnight  and  from  her  employers  C  �122  per
    fortnight which gave a total figure of �153.85 per  week.   As  to  her
    child and tax credits that came to �286.60 per week,  therefore  income
    from all sources came to a figure of �440.45 per week giving a  monthly
    income of �1,908.61.  This was above the figure recorded by  the  judge
    at [27] who found it to be �1,700 per month from all sources.  Mr Avery
    then gave the figure for income support and associated  benefits  which
    was �71.70 for a single parent, �65 per child with four children giving
    a total figure of �331.70 plus family premium of �17 per week to give a
    total of �348.70.  The rent was �200 per week therefore from her income
    of �440.45 per week would leave a figure of �240.45 per week which  was
    considerably less than the figure of �349 which  was  said  to  be  the
    benchmark for the adequacy of maintenance.  Thus he submitted, even  if
    it is not clear as to the circumstances relating to accommodation,  the
    Appellants could not succeed as they could not  demonstrate  that  they
    would be maintained on the calculations provided.

23. Mr Scott submitted that the judge did not make  an  error  of  law  and
    relied upon  the  Rule  24  response  that  had  been  provided  as  to
    accommodation, the Rule 24 response said that at paragraph  35  of  the
    determination the judge noted at the date of decision the  Sponsor  was
    renting a four bedroomed property for which the tenancy  agreement  was
    in the bundle.  Whilst the Sponsor had two  other  children  they  were
    very young and shared a room and therefore there would be two  bedrooms
    available for the two Appellants.

24. In his oral submissions he conceded there must have been some confusion
    on the basis submitted by Mr Avery.  He further submitted  the  Sponsor
    was renting the property but was living in a different property at  the
    date of the hearing which is what the judge  had  referred  to  and  he
    submitted that it was possible that  paragraph  25  was  based  on  the
    Sponsor's evidence that she was moving to  a  house.   However  in  his
    submission she did have a four bedroomed property and  therefore  there
    was no difficulty with the finding made as  to  accommodation  even  if
    there had been some confusion.

25. In respect of maintenance, it was submitted in  the  Rule  24  response
    that the judge did make clear what evidence there was  in  relation  to
    income noting at [18] that the Sponsor was working as  a  cleaner  with
    two jobs, in receipt of child and working tax credits and that she  was
    earning �1,700 per month supporting by payslips,  bank  statements  and
    contracts of employment.  The judge confirmed the submissions  made  on
    her behalf that the income was �1,700 per month from  all  sources  and
    that she had more than the amount that  she  would  receive  in  income
    support after deducting the rent, and based on the figures given by the
    judge, she had �100 over the limit as her income was approximately �225
    per week and the amount received and income  support  was  �129.83  per
    week.

26. In his oral submissions, he submitted that Mr Avery had calculated  the
    figure  of  �1,908  per  month  which  was  arguably  more   than   the
    determination and he also pointed to the fact that on the findings made
    by the judge, the Sponsor was sending money from her income  of  US$200
    or US$300 per month supporting two Appellants on her income and thus in
    those circumstances the judge was entitled to come to the decision that
    maintenance was adequate.

27. Mr Scott acknowledged that there was no evidence as to  the  applicable
    income support rates placed before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
    judge's finding at paragraph 28 that the figure was �129.83 was  not  a
    figure supported by evidence and put before the First-tier Tribunal and
    therefore must have come from the judge's own  knowledge.   He  further
    accepted that the figure for the applicable income  support  rates  for
    2013 relevant to the date of decision that  had  been  provided  by  Mr
    Avery was correct and that in total those benefits  came  to  �349  per
    week.

28. I enquired of the parties that in the event of an error  of  law  being
    found, how did each advocate invite  the  Tribunal  to  deal  with  the
    outstanding issues.  Mr Avery submitted that if an  error  of  law  was
    found, the judge had not considered Article 8 and therefore  a  resumed
    hearing would be required before the Upper Tribunal.  Mr Scott, in  his
    submission was that if an error of law was found then the appeal should
    be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision on the error of law:

29. In a determination promulgated on the 16th June 2014, I found that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law  in  her  consideration  of  the
    issues of maintenance and accommodation. The reasons  are  set  out  as
    follows:

         "1.  Dealing with the issue  of  maintenance,  the  judge  at  [18]
             recorded that the income at the date of decision comprised  of
             money obtained from two jobs as a cleaner and that she was  in
             receipt of child and tax credits.  The judge also recorded  at
             [19]  that  he  had  taken  into  account  the   "contact   of
             employment, payslips and bank statements  leading  up  to  the
             date of decision and letter relating to receipt  of  work  and
             tax credits".  The judge reached the conclusion  that  overall
             the income she received was "on average �1,700 per month" (see
             [18] and conclusion at [27]).  However the First-tier Tribunal
             Judge did not set out in the determination how the  figure  of
             �1,700 was reached and whilst reference was  made  in  general
             terms to the documents, there was no attempt to set out in any
             particularity how that figure was arrived  at.   The  parties,
             having done their own calculation today appear to have reached
             a different figure in  excess  of  �1,700  of  one  of  �1,902
             (looking at the income of two jobs and taking into account tax
             credit) which of itself demonstrates the importance of setting
             out by reference to the documents how the  overall  figure  is
             arrived at.  It is not clear whether the figure of �1,700 took
             into account other benefits  paid  to  the  Sponsor  including
             child  benefits,  family  premium  or  benefits  relating   to
             dependent children.  The figure of Mr Avery  of  �1,902,  took
             into account her employment as a cleaner with two  jobs  which
             was �185 per fortnight and �122 per fortnight giving  a  total
             of �153.85 per week and including a figure of �286.60 per week
             when taking together to give a monthly  income  of  �1,908.61.
             That does not appear to have taken into account any amount for
             child benefit."

         2.   As to the  figures  of  the  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of
             maintenance, as set out in KA and Others  (Pakistan)  Adequacy
             of maintenance [2006] UKAIT 00065, the  level  of  income  and
             other benefits would be available if the family  were  drawing
             income support remain the yardstick.  This has been  confirmed
             in French v the ECO (Kingston) [2011] EWA  Civ  35  and  Yarce
             (adequate maintenance: benefits) [2012] UKUT 00425 (IAC).  The
             figure used by the judge at [28] is �129.83 per  week  and  is
             not particularised by comparison with the benefits  applicable
             and only refers to "a single parent with dependent children is
             entitled to income support in the amount of �129.13 per week."
              The decision of Yarce (as cited) makes it clear at [27]  that
             in order to establish that maintenance is "adequate" under the
             Rule, an applicant needs to show that the resources  available
             will meet or exceed the relevant income support level  set  by
             the UK government ("the target figure").  The  paragraph  goes
             on to say;

                  "If the applicant is intending to live with  a  spouse  or
                  partner in the United Kingdom, the  income  support  level
                  that he or she must meet will be such level as  being  set
                  by  the  government  in  respect  of  the  couple.   Where
                  children are included, the target figure will be increased
                  by the relevant  figure  or  figures  for  each  dependent
                  child."

             and at [28] stated "KA (Pakistan) establishes that the  target
             figure is an 'objective' one.  It is therefore immaterial that
             the applicant and/or any relevant family, as  just  described,
             can be shown to be more likely than not to live on  less  than
             that figure", and [29]:-

                  "The present case requires an examination of  the  effect,
                  if any, of the arrival of an applicant for entry clearance
                  upon the Sponsor's entitlement to  certain  benefits,  and
                  thus on the ability of the applicant to demonstrate  there
                  are available resources at or above the target figure  ...
                  only by establishing this can proper findings be  made  as
                  the  actual  financial   position   of   the   individuals
                  concerned."

             It is accepted by both applicants that the figures set out  in
             the judge's determination was not provided by reference to any
             applicable benefit figures therefore it cannot  be  said  what
             that figure represented, whether it took  into  account  other
             benefits as suggested by the cases cited above or indeed  that
             was the figure for the income support rate for a single parent
             at the date of decision which Mr  Avery  states  was  �71  per
             week.

         3.   As to the issue of accommodation, the decision  of  the  judge
             reflects some confusion concerning  the  evidence  before  the
             First-tier Tribunal.  At [25], the judge refers to the Sponsor
             renting one room in a four bedroomed property whereas at  [18]
             refers to her living in a four bedroomed home with  two  minor
             children.  I have not been referred to a tenancy agreement but
             at page 67 the letter from  the  landlord  refers  to  a  four
             bedroomed  house  that  "she  can  stay  with  her   siblings"
             referring to 59 Turnbull Avenue.  It is therefore not clear on
             what basis the judge  considered  the  issue  of  adequacy  of
             accommodation either.  If it was based on the  evidence  given
             orally by the Sponsor there  is  no  record  of  that  in  the
             determination and that has not been able to be resolved before
             the Tribunal at this  stage  from  any  other  evidence.   The
             confusion remains.

         4.   A further issue has been raised by Mr Avery  by  reference  to
             the Sponsor's income concerning the inconsistency between  the
             documents and the  payslips  (see  his  earlier  submissions).
             This also does not appear to have been taken into  account  by
             the judge when looking at the issue of income.

         5.   The Tribunal has said on a number of occasions that a schedule
             of benefits and/income should be place before  the  First-tier
             Tribunal or on appeal, the  Upper  Tribunal,  to  reflect  the
             comparison between the applicant and  the  Sponsor's  combined
             projected income and the amount required to prove  maintenance
             at a level that  can  properly  be  called  adequate.   Income
             received and the prospective figures should be expressed on  a
             consistent and arithmetically accurate basis (see the decision
             of Ahmed (as previously cited)).  The First-tier Tribunal  did
             not have the benefit of such a calculation or schedule nor  it
             appears, did not have the benefit of any evidence relating  to
             what the  applicable  and  relevant  benefits  were.   I  have
             therefore  reached  the  conclusion  that  the   determination
             discloses errors of  law  for  the  reasons  given  above  and
             therefore   the   decision   relating   to   maintenance   and
             accommodation should be set aside.

         6.   Whilst I have been provided with figures from Mr Avery and  Mr
             Scott as to the applicable  benefits  and  comparisons  as  to
             income, the calculations given do not seem to accord  with  my
             own.  On the calculations  the  figure  of  income  of  �1,902
             (which was some �2,000 in excess of that found by the  judge),
             consisting of �185 per fortnight from one source of employment
             and �122 per fortnight  from  C  employment  giving  a  weekly
             figure of �153.85 does not seem  to  be  consistent  with  the
             payslips.  The figure for the tax credit is said to be �286.60
             but no allowance in the total has been  given  for  any  child
             benefit for the two present children  and  no  arguments  have
             been advanced before the Tribunal as  to  whether  the  figure
             should include that of the two children who would  be  joining
             the applicant.  Furthermore there is the inconsistency  as  to
             the Sponsor's income from the documents  at  page  52  of  the
             bundle  and  the  payslips  which  give  a  larger  figure  of
             �8,000.28 rather than the �6,657 taken from page 52.

         7.   The issue of accommodation as set out  earlier  is  still  not
             clear and for the reasons set out above the judge did not deal
             with the issue of Article 8 and both advocates agreed that  in
             the event that an error of law is established that  the  issue
             was required to be considered at a resumed  hearing  where  Mr
             Scott indicated  he  had  wished  to  call  further  evidence.
             Whilst Mr Scott invited the Tribunal  for  the  matter  to  be
             remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, I prefer  the  submission
             of Mr Avery that the Upper Tribunal, having  dealt  with  this
             issue should consider the  appeal  at  a  resumed  hearing  to
             remake the decision.  In those circumstances, as  there  still
             remains uncertainty as the applicable figure  for  income  and
             the applicable benefits, the issues relating to  accommodation
             and  that  in  any  event  the  issue  of  Article  8  remains
             outstanding, the case will be listed for a resumed hearing."

The resumed hearing:

30. The hearing was listed having given directions to the parties to  serve
    upon each other and the Tribunal, a schedule setting out the  Sponsor's
    income by reference to documents in the bundle and by  giving  specific
    figures for  each  employment  and  the  source  of  the  evidence  and
    providing figures for the benefits received in the  United  Kingdom  at
    the date of decision.  I also directed there should be a  corresponding
    schedule showing the applicable  benefit  based  on  the  benefit  rate
    applicable at the date  of  decision  and  establishing  which  benefit
    should be taken into account.  I considered this was necessary in  view
    of what had previously happened  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    before myself.  A direction was given for any further  evidence  to  be
    filed no later than seven days before the resumed hearing.  The hearing
    was  listed on 3rd September 2014.   On  that  day  Mr  Tarlow,  Senior
    Presenting Officer appeared on behalf of the Entry  Clearance  Officer.
    An application for an adjournment was made by Mr Tarlow on the basis of
    the  additional  evidence  that  had  been  served  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants.  This referred to a fresh source of income  not  previously
    disclosed either before the First-tier Tribunal  or  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal at the last hearing.  Mr Tarlow  had  not  had  sight  of  the
    documents until the morning of the hearing and were not on his file  as
    being received by the Secretary of State although  Mr  Scott  told  the
    Tribunal that it had been served  the  week  before.   However  it  was
    served late and  not  in  accordance  with  the  directions.   No  Rule
    15(2)(a) application was made for  this  fresh  evidence.   Furthermore
    there was no statement from  the  Sponsor  to  set  out  that  evidence
    bearing in mind that  it  had  not  been  disclosed  before  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, before the First-tier Tribunal or before  the  Upper
    Tribunal at the hearing in June at the error of law  hearing.   However
    as I considered it was important evidence, the  evidence  was  admitted
    but an adjournment was granted  and  the  hearing  re-listed  for  16th
    October.

31. At that hearing Mr Wilding appeared on behalf of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer with Mr Scott appearing on behalf of both Appellants as he  has
    done before the First-tier Tribunal and before the Upper Tribunal.   At
    the hearing both parties had produced further evidence.  On  behalf  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer there was  a  witness  statement  from  the
    HMRC, a copy of the 2012/2013  benefit  and  tax  credit  rates  and  a
    statement relating to earnings and benefit rates (the schedule  ordered
    by way of directions).  In addition Mr Wilding produced copies  of  the
    following decisions; AAO v Entry Clearance Officer [2011] EWCA Civ 840,
    FK & OK (Botswana) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 238 and VW  (Uganda)  v  SSHD
    [2009] EWCA Civ 5.  On  behalf  of  the  Appellants,  further  evidence
    included a witness statement of the Sponsor, copies  of  payslips  with
    additional employment from L & Co, and a letter from L & Co  dated  4th
    September 2014.  There was also a further bundle including  a  schedule
    of weekly income of the Sponsor, schedule of appropriate  benefit  rate
    at the date of refusal, Sponsor's bank statement dated  13th   February
    2013, a letter from the Sponsor's landlord and a further  copy  of  the
    tenancy agreement relating to No  59   and  a  copy  of  the  Sponsor's
    payslip with L & Co.

32. I heard oral evidence from the  Sponsor.   The  Sponsor  confirmed  the
    statement made on 16th September 2014  and  that  was  adopted  as  her
    evidence-in-chief.  In that statement she confirmed that she had  three
    jobs; working part-time with G M being paid �185.70 every two weeks and
    also worked for C and was paid every two weeks �111.42 and  also  part-
    time with L & Co as a cleaner.  She stated that they paid her weekly in
    cash but prepared a payslip and gave it to her monthly.  She  said  she
    worked for L & Co for about three  months  starting  on  28th  December
    2012.  She was asked when she started working for L &  Co  whether  she
    knew she would be working for them.  She said she did not know and that
    she had stopped working for them  when  the  work  had  finished.   She
    confirmed that she had been in receipt of tax  credits  at  that  time.
    When asked what basis the tax credits were calculated, she stated  that
    she started work in December and told them this  and  that  the  agency
    told her to tell them how much she earned in April however before April
    she stopped working.  When asked what were the different  kinds of  tax
    credits she was given, she said that she did not know.

33. In relation to her brother and sister, she  confirmed  that  they  were
    still living in the same circumstances in  Ethiopia  as  they  were  in
    January 2013.  Turning to accommodation, she confirmed that they  would
    live at the same address as her.  When asked about the type of property
    it was she stated that it was a four bedroomed house that had a  living
    room and a kitchen.  She stated that the accommodation was adequate for
    all of them.

34. The Sponsor was  cross-examined  by  Mr  Wilding.   She  was  asked  in
    relation to the accommodation whether anyone else was  living  at  that
    property.  The tenancy agreement was produced, where it was stated that
    the landlord is Mr AG (page 6 of  the  Appellants'  bundle).   She  was
    asked if he lived at that property and she confirmed that he  did  not.
    It was put to her that if that were  right,  the  letter  that  he  had
    written to the Tribunal gave  his  address  as  the  accommodation  she
    claimed to exclusively occupy.  Her explanation was  that  that  was  a
    simple mistake and what he meant was that  he  was  the  owner  of  the
    property and that he  did  not  live  there.   Clarification  was  made
    concerning the place of residence at the date  of  the  decision.   She
    confirmed that at the date of  decision  and  now  she  was  living  at
    another address, a two bedroomed address, paying �60 per week but  that
    she also rents the larger property at No. 59 which she intends to  live
    at should her brother and sister join her in the United Kingdom.

35. Mr Wilding then turned to the issue of maintenance.  She confirmed that
    she had been working at G M since 2011 and that she  did  twenty  hours
    per week.  As to her employment with  C  she  confirmed  that  she  had
    worked there since September 2011.  She was asked if she worked  twenty
    hours per week at C.  She said she did twenty hours per  fortnight  and
    they paid her fortnightly therefore  ten  hours  per  week.   She  also
    confirmed that when she was working at L & Co she worked for  25  hours
    per week.  It was put to  her  that  when  she  claimed  benefits,  tax
    credits for example she declared in 2011/2012 that she was only working
    for twenty hours per week (see pages 46, 52 and 56).  She was asked why
    she did not tell HMRC that she was working in excess  of  twenty  hours
    per week.  Her explanation was that for both jobs she worked ten  hours
    per week and the payslip said twenty hours because  it  covered  a  two
    week period.  It was put to her again  that  she  had  agreed  she  had
    worked for G M for twenty hours per week and  she  confirmed  that  she
    worked for C for ten hours per week and confirmed she did work at  L  &
    Co for 25 hours per week and that is 55 hours per week whereas she  had
    told HMRC twenty hours per week.  She stated that her work was shown on
    her payslips and it was twenty hours but in fact she did ten hours  per
    week and worked ten hours.  This was further clarified and for G M  she
    said she did ten hours per week, twenty hours per fortnight for  C  and
    also did ten hours per week.  The HMRC statement (see  page  1  of  the
    Respondent's supplementary bundle) was put to her where it was said the
    only record of any employment was with G M.  She stated that she was no
    longer working for C at that time.   It  was  put  to  her  again  that
    between May 2012 and April 2013 HMRC only had records for G M Ltd.  She
    stated that she had left her employment with C on 18th March  2013  and
    had only worked for them until that date.  She was asked again  why  it
    was that HMRC would not know about the period May 2012  to  March  2013
    with C.  She said she had submitted the evidence  and  paperwork  about
    her two jobs.  She said that she had told them that she stopped work in
    one job and then started another.  She was asked if she had  told  them
    she only worked twenty hours per week.  She stated "At first yes but  I
    started the other job late (L & Co).  Those were the two jobs  with  GM
    and C".  It was put to the Sponsor that it was hard to  piece  together
    the hours she worked because she only submitted some  of  her  payslips
    however at page 14 payslip 2nd November 2012 it said "Pay  for  the  30
    units work which means 30 hours at a rate  of  �6.19".   She  confirmed
    that that was the hourly rate.  Thus it was put to her  that  for  that
    fortnightly period she worked 30 hours.   The  Sponsor  explained  that
    they were talking about January 2013 when at first she had worked for G
    M for ten hours per week and then  they  increased  by  five  hours  in
    October 2012 they added five hours per week.  She was asked if she  had
    continued to work for C at that same time (five months)  and  that  she
    did ten hours per week for C.  She confirmed that was  right.   It  was
    therefore put to her for that period she was working for 25  hours  per
    week between October 2012 and March 2011.  She confirmed that  she  did
    do 25 hours then.  She also agreed that on top of that in December 2012
    until March 2013 she did 25 hours per week for L & Co.  It was  put  to
    her that she was working for 50 hours per week but claiming benefit for
    declared work for twenty hours per week.  She stated that she filled  a
    return in April and later informed them she was working extra hours and
    had other jobs and that they had told her to declare it in a  form  the
    following April including the hours worked but before  April  2013  she
    stopped working for two of the companies L & Co and C.  When asked  why
    she had stopped working for C she said that she had found  another  job
    and that she had to go to the  job  early  in  the  morning.   She  had
    stopped working and could not find a job and began working as  a  self-
    employed person from July 2013.  She was asked that when  the  decision
    was made in January she was working 50 hours per week and  whether  she
    could provide evidence that she had told the HMRC that she was  working
    in excess of the twenty hours declared.  The Sponsor  stated  that  she
    had no written evidence and that it was a  telephone  conversation  and
    that they had kept saying to her "Tell us everything".  She  was  asked
    if she had ever told HMRC formally in writing that she was  working  in
    excess of what she had told them.  She said no she had not.

36. She was also asked if at the time of the application  she  was  working
    for three jobs however, she did not mention three and had only referred
    to two.  Her explanation for this was that she had recently started the
    third  and thought that the two jobs she had were enough to put on  the
    form.

37. In relation to her brother and sister, she confirmed that the  children
    lived in the Boli area in Ethiopia when the application  was  made  and
    that they are living with a friend of hers.  She confirmed that she was
    sending money to them and she has not visited them.  In relation to the
    friend, she stated that the friend was Somalian.  As to  the  issue  of
    accommodation she confirmed that when the application was made she  was
    living at an address  at  No.  10   paying  �60  per  week  rent.   She
    confirmed that she provided a tenancy agreement for the other  property
    renting at �200 per week.  Thus it was put to her that at the  date  of
    decision she was paying �260 rent for two  properties.   She  confirmed
    that  that  was  the  position  and  that  she  had   paid   for   both
    accommodations living in one (the smaller two bedroomed  property)  but
    also renting the other.  When asked why she was living in  the  smaller
    property and not living in the other property with four  bedrooms,  she
    stated that she was planning to  move  to  the  other  address  if  the
    applications were successful.  She was asked why she did not move  into
    the  property  because  she  was  paying  a  lot  of  money   for   the
    accommodation.  It was put to her that she would  have  saved  �60  per
    week.  She said that she had made a mistake.  She  confirmed  that  she
    had continued renting the two properties.

38. In re-examination Mr Scott asked about her employment and the  claiming
    of tax credits.  He asked how long she had been  claiming  tax  credits
    overall and she confirmed that she had started the first job  at  C  on
    17th September 2011 and the other job at G M on  26th  September  2011.
    She thought that she had been receiving  tax  credits  overall  between
    October/November 2011.  When asked how the system worked, for  example,
    after having made the first application how many times did she have  to
    fill in a form to make a further application.  She confirmed  that  she
    filled in a form in April every year.  He clarified  her  answer  given
    previously where she said she had told the HMRC about the changes.  She
    confirmed that she had told them about the new jobs and they  told  her
    to fill in a form.  She was asked what HMRC had said when she told them
    about the new job.  The Sponsor stated that she had told them that  she
    had wanted to register a new job and they had said they  would  send  a
    form to declare a new job.  And  later  stopped  working.   He  further
    tried to clarify that answer by asking the Sponsor that in her  earlier
    evidence she had said that they had told her to notify them  in  April.
    She confirmed that was right, to fill in a form for April.

The submissions of the parties:

39. At the conclusion of the hearing I heard submissions from each  of  the
    advocates.  Mr Wilding made the following submissions.   He  relied  on
    the original letter of refusal from the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and
    also relied upon the comments set out at page 9  of  the  supplementary
    bundle from the Respondent.  Those comments set out  that  the  figures
    given by the Appellant in the  schedule  were  unreliable.   They  only
    figure that could be agreed was �348.36 as the figure representing  the
    benefits to which the Sponsor would be entitled to as at  the  date  of
    decision in January 2013.  He submitted that she could  not  meet  that
    figure whether or not the figure  of  �200  in  relation  to  rent  was
    deducted.  He went through the schedule  relating  to  her  employment.
    With L & Co that  there  was  a  temporary  job  of  three  months  and
    therefore it could only have been a temporary job.   He  submitted  the
    Appellant could not rely on that amount as it would not meet  the  test
    of "can and will be" maintained adequately.  He  submitted  this  is  a
    future looking event and as it was a temporary job  only  a  figure  of
    �147.52 of the schedule  therefore  should  be  taken  out.   As  to  C
    employment that ended in  March  2013.   He  submitted  that  the  same
    submission applied equally and therefore �55 should be struck out.  G M
    was the only employment that could be  relied  upon.   She  had  worked
    there for two years and is the only employment that the HMRC was  aware
    of (see page 1 of the HMRC statement).  If taking these figures  for  C
    it would be �410.55 excluding rent.  The figure of rent is �200 and  if
    that is deducted from  that  figure  it  leaves  a  figure  of  �210.55
    therefore she cannot meet the level  of  income  support  necessary  of
    �348.36 on the figures.

40. Mr Wilding's alternative submission was as follows.  He submitted  that
    because the HMRC were not aware of the other employment  that  the  tax
    credits paid were therefore unreliable and that because the Sponsor did
    not tell HMRC that she was working in excess of twenty hours and/or for
    multiple employers, the figure was therefore  unreliable.   Whilst  the
    Sponsor had given evidence to explain this, it is not possible to put a
    positive gloss on it.  He submitted that she had  "played  the  system"
    for two tax years and even at its highest and with the benefit  of  the
    doubt for three months was working for more than twenty  hours  in  the
    tax year 2012/2013.  This is a quarter of the  year  and  she  received
    �14,893 tax  credit  for  2012/2013.   By  rough  arithmetic  that  was
    approximately �4,000 of over claiming and the explanation given by  the
    Sponsor was extraordinary because by April 2013 she  was  only  working
    one job that she did not have to  tell  them.   The  relevant  year  in
    relation to HMRC is set out at pages 51 to 54.  The total payments made
    were �14,899 (page 54) and at page 52 it was assessed at  twenty  hours
    per week.  In the tax year no breakdown of the categories  but  if  the
    categories are looked at page 46, sixteen to 23 hours, 24 to  29  hours
    and 30 hours or more it is difficult to be clear about any  assessments
    but for three months of 2012 to 2013 the evidence was that  she  worked
    for more  than  30  hours  per  week  and  therefore  the  tax  credits
    themselves are tainted and are unreliable as the test "can and will  be
    maintained adequately" if the tax credits are unreliable  she  has  not
    demonstrated that she can meet that burden.  Out of the three jobs that
    the Sponsor had worked HMRC only knew about one of them and it  appears
    that in relation to the other two no tax was paid on them.  Mr  Wilding
    then looked at the calculations on the schedule at page 1  adding  they
    worked together �92.85 and �55.71 and �147.52 gave a total  of  �296.08
    per week multiplied by 52 to give a yearly figure of  �15,396.16  which
    was he submitted well above the income  tax  allowance.   Similarly  he
    submitted the employment amounts were unreliable and it was  not  known
    if the Appellant reached or exceeded the tax free hours or not.  In any
    event the tax credits paid are unreliable and it is not known how  much
    tax would be paid in any event.

41. Turning to the question of accommodation, there are no bank  statements
    showing  direct  debits  attributable  to  rent  although   there   are
    withdrawals of cash amounts.  The figure of �200 per week  is  for  the
    four bedroomed property.  That cost of accommodation has  to  be  taken
    into account.  Thus the figures demonstrate that she  cannot  meet  the
    income support level of �348.36.  As to  the  accommodation  there  was
    limited evidence of whether it is adequate.    The  evidence  from  the
    landlord does not say that the property is empty or  that  the  sponsor
    has exclusive occupancy and there is no evidence of whether she  is  in
    receipt of council tax benefits or not.  He pointed out that it was not
    known who paid the council tax as no documents had been provided.

42. Dealing with Article 8 he observed that both Appellants are minors  and
    that there are two  children  in  the  UK  affected  by  the  decision.
    Applying Section 55 of the 2009 Act, he submitted it could  not  be  in
    the children's best interests to come and live  in  the  UK  below  the
    poverty line.  He made reference to the decisions of AAO  at  paragraph
    47 and 49 and reminded the Tribunal  that  in  re-making  the  decision
    paragraph 117A-D applied to the Article 8 assessment and in  particular
    117B(iii) that it is in the public interest that those who went to  the
    UK are financially independent and that this did not exclude  children.
    These were factors and considerations to take into account.  He further
    relied on the decision in FK (Botswana) at paragraph  11  and  that  in
    this case there was a  strong  public  interest  element.   As  to  the
    circumstances in Ethiopia when those decisions are made Judge Ruth  did
    not take into account the applicant's evidence as to maintenance but in
    any event the circumstances  in  Ethiopia  demonstrate  that  they  are
    housed and have facilities and there was adequate living accommodation.
      There  was  nothing  in  the  cases  suggested  that   their   living
    arrangements were in a precarious state and that proportionality was in
    favour of a refusal of the appeals.

43. Mr Scott provided his schedule.  He submitted that the Tribunal  should
    take into account all elements of income set out in that schedule given
    the figure of �613.76.  He submitted whilst the letter from L & Co said
    it was temporary, that was written retrospectively and the  Sponsor  in
    evidence said when she started it she was not told it was going  to  be
    temporary and received the income.  As to her  employment  with  C  she
    stopped working for them after December 2013 and  she had been  working
    for them for at least one year since 2011 and therefore that employment
    could not be classed as temporary.  As  to  the  tax  credits,  he  had
    submitted the Sponsor did explain the circumstances  in  which  he  had
    applied for tax credits filling in a  form  every  April  and  the  tax
    credits in January 2013 were calculated on the basis of employment  for
    the previous year of 2011/2012 therefore looking at page 5 the payslips
    of G M 4th November 2011 fortnightly twenty hours (ten hours per  week)
    and page 16 the letter from C 5th November to 18th November  two  weeks
    at twenty hours.  Therefore the tax credits were  correctly  calculated
    based on the income of the previous year.  Her  explanation  should  be
    accepted that she had spoken to the HMRC as to the new  employment  and
    told them to notify them in April.  He further submitted that  at  page
    53 there was also a reference to a  childcare  element.   He  submitted
    that the increase in tax credits could be accounted for  the  childcare
    element.  Therefore taking into account all of those elements  she  was
    entitled to that income.

44. As to accommodation the landlord had provided a letter.   The  evidence
    of the Sponsor was that he had made a mistake as  to  the  address  and
    that she has exclusive occupation.  The payment of rent should be  �200
    and that should be deducted from the figures.  Even if  the  figure  of
    �260 was deducted  (which  took  account  of  the  �200  for  the  four
    bedroomed property and �60 for the two bedroomed property)  her  income
    is still above the figure of �348.36.  Thus she succeeds.

45. In the alternative, Mr Scott relied upon Article 8 that the  First-tier
    Tribunal did make findings as to their  circumstances  which  were  not
    challenged by the Home Office that they were not attending  school  and
    that they were dependent on the Sponsor and  that  she  is  their  only
    living relative and they are living in Ethiopia temporarily and have no
    status.   The children are  still  under  18  and  therefore  the  best
    interests of the children are for  them  to  be  looked  after  by  the
    Sponsor.  The Sponsor has shown that she has adequate  maintenance  and
    accommodation and therefore in  respect  of  family  life  between  the
    children and the Sponsor should be taken  into  account  and  therefore
    proportionality of the decisions  require  them  to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom.

46. I reserved my decision.

Conclusions:

47.  Each  party  has  provided  a  schedule  relevant  to  the  issue   of
    maintenance.  The Appellants' schedule is set out at  document  1.   It
    gives employment with GM at �92.85, employment with C  at  �55.71,  tax
    credits paid weekly at  �286.60,  child  benefit  paid  at  �31.10  and
    employment with L & Co at �147.52, giving a total of  �613.78.   It  is
    accepted that the figure has to be adjusted  to  take  account  of  the
    applicable housing costs.  As to this issue, it is now clear  from  the
    evidence before the Upper Tribunal  that  the  Sponsor  states  she  is
    paying rent for two properties; the property  she  lives  in  (the  two
    bedroomed property which she has always lived in and continues to do so
    with her two children at �60 per week) but also is paying  for  a  four
    bedroomed property at a rate of �200 per week.  Thus her housing  costs
    are �260.  I make the following observations.  Firstly, when  the  case
    was before the First-tier Tribunal, the  judge  recorded  the  evidence
    before her that the Sponsor was living in  a  four  bedroomed  property
    paying �200 per week rent and living there with the two  children  (see
    paragraph 18 of the First-tier Tribunal decision)  and  refers  to  the
    landlord's letter and the tenancy agreement (paragraph  19;  FTT).   At
    [25] the judge refers to her renting a four bedroomed property but that
    she referred to a different property she would rent in  the  event  the
    children came to the UK and the judge records that  she  did  not  take
    that into account because it was "postdecision  evidence".   The  judge
    was therefore not referring to the four bedroomed property  at  No.  59
    but another property and seemed to be wholly unaware that  the  Sponsor
    was in fact living in the two bedroomed  property  with  the  children.
    However looking at a statement that was before the First-tier  Tribunal
    there is reference in that statement to the Sponsor  giving  a  current
    address at No. 10 and also renting the property at 59.  I also  observe
    that whilst there is a letter from the landlord, there is  no  evidence
    of rent being paid by way of direct debit and the only evidence relates
    to cash withdrawals from the account  in  various  sums  which  do  not
    equate with the rent paid but are in various  cash  sums.   No  details
    have been provided for the council tax which is  a  housing  cost  that
    needs to  be  put  in  the  balance  of  figures.   Despite  directions
    concerning evidence on these issues such evidence has  still  not  been
    produced.  It is not known whether the Sponsor pays council tax on  one
    property or both properties or for none of them.  The landlord makes no
    reference to this nor does the Sponsor.  It is therefore  not  possible
    to give an accurate figure for the housing costs as  the  parties  have
    been unable to provide any figures for any council tax payment (if  any
    is such payable).  On the basis that she is paying rent at �200 for the
    four  bedroomed  property,  this  being  the  property  that  she   has
    identified for herself and the Appellants to occupy, I do not  consider
    that it is right to increase the housing costs to a figure of �260,  to
    include the present property that she resides  in  but  that  the  more
    accurate figure is �200, although as I have said the actual figure  may
    be more because no council tax documents have  been  provided.   Taking
    the figure of �200, and reducing the figure in the Appellant's schedule
    that provides for a figure of �413.78 as the total weekly income of all
    sources including tax credits, employment and child benefit.

48. For the reasons given in his submissions at document  9  and  his  oral
    submissions, Mr Wilding submits that the figures in that  schedule  are
    not reliable for two reasons. Firstly, the employment at L & Co  should
    be disregarded for the reasons he has  given  and  secondly,  that  the
    information given by the Sponsor to the HMRC as to her  hours  of  work
    and  employers  was  incorrect  and  that  consequently   the   figures
    calculated for tax credits are unreliable as  they  require  adjustment
    for a number of matters.  No figures could be  given  to  quantify  any
    adjustments to  correct  the  working  tax  credit  and  therefore  the
    Appellants have not proved their case and the burden is  upon  them  to
    demonstrate that they meet the requirements.

49. Consequently the only figure that can be agreed between  the  advocates
    is the figure for the threshold level for the applicable  benefits  set
    out at page 8 of the Respondent's bundle showing a total  threshold  of
    �348.36 (comprising of income support, payments  to  the  children  and
    family premium).

50. I therefore considered with care the evidence I  have  heard  from  the
    Sponsor and considered it in the light of the documents that have  been
    provided.  There is of  course  no  issue  concerning  the  burden  and
    standard of proof; it lies on the Appellants to demonstrate the factual
    circumstances on the balance of  probabilities.   I  observe  that  the
    figure relating to the issue of maintenance and that of income was  one
    that was plainly at issue at the time of the refusal  and  that  proper
    schedules were not produced before the First-tier Tribunal and  despite
    directions, there is still evidence that has not been either  clarified
    further or in the case of the council tax benefits, is still absent.

51. I deal with the issue of the income of the Sponsor. The evidence before
    the First-tier Tribunal was at the date of  the  decision  namely  23rd
    January 2013 she had two sources of employment; working with GM and C &
    Co.  Those two sources of employment were disclosed in the  application
    form of the Appellants.  No reference was made to any other  employment
    with L & Co (see [18] FTT determination).  Her evidence is that she has
    been working for  GM  since  2011,  twenty  hours  per  week  and  from
    September 2011 for C for twenty hours per fortnight therefore ten hours
    per week.  She sought to clarify this further in her  evidence  stating
    that in January 2013 she had worked with GM for ten hours per week then
    it was increased by  five  hours  and  in  October  2012  it  had  been
    increased by five hours and she did ten hours per week with employer C.
     Therefore on that evidence she had worked  25  hours  between  October
    2012 and March 2013 for both employers C and GM and  therefore  on  her
    own account was  working  in  excess  of  twenty  hours  (although  the
    Respondent says there was evidence referring to 30 hours  for  part  of
    this time).

52. The documentary evidence before me is not consistent with the Sponsor's
    account as to her hours of  work.   The  documents  consistently  makes
    reference to twenty hours per week as a total figure (see  pages  46-60
    the documents relating to tax credits).  At page 46 for  the  year  6th
    April 2011 to 5th April 2012 it is said twenty hours per week, at  page
    52 referring to 6th April 2012 to 5th April 2013 it referred to  twenty
    hours per week and at page 56 for the period  6th  April  2013  to  5th
    April 2014 it says twenty hours a week.  It is not possible to  make  a
    full comparison with any payslips as there were  no  complete  sets  of
    payslips  available.   However  there  are  some  payslips   from   her
    employment with GM showing hours worked of 30 hours (see pages  13  and
    15 of A's bundle).  One of those payslips is dated  11th  January  2013
    and therefore is not consistent with the Sponsor's  evidence  that  she
    worked only an extra five hours.  Thus  on  her  own  evidence  between
    October 2012 and March 2013 she worked for twenty five hours with C and
    GM and on top of this worked 25 hours between October  2012  and  March
    2013 with employment with L & Co therefore giving a total of  50  hours
    which would  be  30  hours  in  excess  of  that  referred  to  in  the
    documentation referred to above.  None of the documents  at  paragraphs
    42 to 60 make any reference to hours worked in excess of twenty  hours.



53. I have considered the explanation given by the  Sponsor  which  is,  in
    essence, that she had disclosed hours in excess of twenty  hours  in  a
    telephone conversation.  She stated that she had  filled  the  form  in
    April and later informed them that she had other jobs and they told her
    to declare it the following April but by April  2013  she  had  stopped
    working for L & Co and C.  She  accepted  that  there  was  no  written
    evidence to support this and she did not tell them formally in  writing
    and that it was undertaken in a telephone conversation.

54. As Mr Wilding points out the documents themselves make reference to the
    applicant's personal circumstances at page 56 for example,  at  part  1
    under "personal circumstances" it is plain that tax credits  are  based
    on the applicant's personal circumstances.  It is stated  that  "please
    tell us immediately if anything is wrong, missing or incomplete because
    if you receive more money than you are entitled to, you  will  have  to
    pay the money back".  Under the paragraph entitled "claimant" it  makes
    it plain that tax credits take account of the  hours  worked  and  that
    there are four bands of hours namely less than sixteen  hours,  between
    sixteen to 23 and between 24 to 29 and 30 hours a week  or  more.   The
    document sets out that the claimant  should  "tell  us  if  your  hours
    changed so you move from one of the above groups into  another".   This
    is because deductions and alterations would be likely  to  be  made  to
    payments received as it is calculated on the hours of work which is why
    the banding of hours is given in the documentation.   The  Sponsor  has
    provided no evidence of the telephone conversation.  Even  if  she  did
    tell them orally, there is no evidence reflecting this in the documents
    provided.  The documents for the following year 2013-2014  still  refer
    to the hours worked as twenty hours and therefore the  submission  made
    by Mr Scott  that  the  statement  made  by  HMRC  at  page  1  of  the
    Respondent's bundle may refer to the following year, is  not  supported
    by the document that relates to the next tax year.  The Sponsor has had
    disclosure  of  the  written  statement  from  HMRC  setting  out  only
    employment known by GM prior to the hearing  but  does  not  sought  to
    clarify any of the figures or the statement which sets out the only one
    source of employment provided for at  a  sum  of  �3,873  with  no  tax
    deducted.

55. I am not in the position to  make  any  finding  that  there  was  non-
    disclosure on the part of the Sponsor to the HMRC but on  the  evidence
    before me I cannot be satisfied that the figures provided for  the  tax
    credits to be reliable  figures  as  to  income  as  they  plainly  are
    calculated on the basis of less hours worked and as Mr Wilding submits,
    there is at least a period of three months  between  October  2012  and
    March 2013 where she worked in excess of twenty hours and that, even if
    she did inform them as she stated, it has not  been  demonstrated  that
    this has been taken account of in the figures paid or nor has  it  been
    demonstrated that it has been taken into account in any other financial
    year or the applicable sum which would be required to be paid back.  Mr
    Wilding properly stated that he could not put a figure that  should  be
    properly deducted but it  would  make  a  difference.   He  refers  the
    Tribunal to the documents at pages 51 to 54 of the bundle.   There  are
    no breakdown of the categories  set out at page 46 and it is plain that
    that the banding of 30 hours or more applied as she worked for a period
    of three months in excess of twenty hours  and  therefore  fell  within
    that band.  Therefore the figures are unreliable as they stand  and  it
    has not been demonstrated on  the  Appellants'  behalf  that  they  are
    reliable figures which should be taken into  account.   The  burden  is
    upon the Appellants to make their case and to properly put  before  the
    Tribunal evidence that they rely  upon.   I  therefore  find  that  the
    figure given for tax credits is  not  reliable  and  it  has  not  been
    properly established on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  she  was
    entitled to those sums set out in the schedule and  that  the  schedule
    itself  properly  makes  an  assessment  of   her   overall   financial
    circumstances.  It is plain that any payments that were made in  excess
    of the hours worked would require an adjustment whether now or at  some
    point in the future  and  no  figure  has  been  provided  as  to  what
    adjustment that would be.  Whilst  Mr  Scott  submitted  that  the  tax
    credit documents referred to a childcare element and that the  increase
    in tax credits could  be  accounted  for  the  childcare  element,  the
    document show that the overall figures have already  been  broken  down
    into tax credits and child tax credits.

56. However even if I were to accept that the tax credits as set out on the
    schedule should be taken into account in full and on the basis  of  the
    figures as given, I am still required to consider the  employment  that
    she had at the date of decision and what is  encompassed  in  "can  and
    will be" the  wording  of  paragraph  297(1)(f)(iv).   Looking  at  the
    sources of income, I am satisfied that at  the  date  of  decision  the
    Sponsor had been working for two employers namely GM and  C.   She  had
    been in that employment since 2011 and it can be seen  as  longstanding
    and employment that reflected her earning capacity. The employment with
    L & Co was not disclosed by the Sponsor until a very late stage in  the
    proceedings and after the first hearing before the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    June 2014.  The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  referred  only
    to two sources of employment with C and GM and the original application
    also only referred to those two employers.  There is  no  reference  to
    any source of employment  with  L  &  Co  in  the  HMRC  document  (see
    statement at page 1).  The nature of that employment is set out in  the
    letter dated 4th September 2014 that it was on a  temporary  basis  for
    three months only.  The Sponsor's oral evidence was that  she  did  not
    know how long she would be working for them but it is  plain  from  the
    letter that it was only ever temporary employment and shown by not only
    the terms of the contract but by its duration.   The  Sponsor  has  not
    referred in her evidence to have taken any employment like that  either
    before in any preceding period or since.  The  fact  that  it  was  not
    disclosed in the application as a source of employment  or  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal supports my overall conclusion  from  the  evidence
    that this was a temporary position and not one that could  be  properly
    seen as reflecting either her earning capacity in the past  or  in  the
    future and therefore it should not properly be taken  into  account  to
    satisfy the maintenance requirements.

57. The figures given in any event are incorrect.  There are three payslips
    showing sums of �639.28 giving a total of  the  three  months  work  of
    �1,917.84 the payslips do not refer to any tax  or  national  insurance
    contributions being paid.  The schedule refers to �639.28 multiplied by
    12 to give a yearly figure of �7,671.36 then divided by 52  to  give  a
    weekly figure of �147.52.  That figure presupposes that she worked  for
    one year at that level which she plainly did not and  on  the  evidence
    that I have heard, does not demonstrate that  she  has  worked  in  any
    employment of that nature for any further length of time nor  that  she
    had any potential earning capacity of a similar  nature  shown  by  her
    employment history either before or since that date.

58. Therefore taking into account the applicable  income,  I  am  satisfied
    that it should be considered as follows.  The  employment  with  GM  at
    �92.85 and the employment with C at �55.71.  Whilst I have not accepted
    this figure for the working tax credit of �286.60, even  if  that  full
    amount were added in along with the child benefit at �31.10 that  would
    give a figure of �466.26.  The housing cost of �200 per  week  must  be
    taken into account and that  would  give  a  figure  of  �266.26.   The
    threshold requirement that both parties  have  agreed  is  �348.26  and
    therefore it shows  that  the  Appellants  cannot  meet  the  threshold
    requirement and fall far short of it.

59. Even if an additional sum of money was attributable to  the  employment
    with L & Co the figure given in the schedule set out in  the  preceding
    paragraph does not  reflect  the  income  earned  or  her  own  earning
    capacity.  Even if by a rough estimate �1,917.84 was divided to give  a
    weekly figure it would give a  figure  of  �36.88  giving  a  total  of
    �303.14 but that still falls far below the threshold that is  required.
    Therefore the Appellants have not demonstrated that they can  meet  the
    maintenance requirements.

60. I  have  set  out  earlier  the  evidence  relating  to  the  issue  of
    accommodation and the inconsistent  evidence  given  as  to  where  the
    Sponsor has actually been living whether in the two bedroomed  property
    and not the four bedroomed property  that  she  states  she  is  paying
    rental for.  It has not been properly explained why she is  paying  for
    two sets of accommodation at the total rate of �260 per week.  Whilst I
    can understand  that  she  is  required  to  demonstrate  adequacy  and
    availability of accommodation for them all, it does not explain why she
    did not simply move to the four bedroomed property and therefore reduce
    her overall expenditure by �60 per  week.   Nonetheless  accepting  the
    evidence before me that the property is available and adequate for  the
    Appellants and the Sponsor  to occupy, the  Appellants  cannot  succeed
    under the Immigration Rules as they cannot demonstrate that  they  meet
    the requirements  for  maintenance  for  the  reasons  set  out  above.
    Therefore the appeals are dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

Article 8 of the ECHR:

61. I now turn to the issue relating to Article 8.  The  primary  facts  as
    found by Judge Ruth in relation  to  the  children's  circumstances  in
    Ethiopia have not been challenged by the Entry Clearance Officer.  Thus
    they are my starting point. They can be summarised as follows:
    (a)  The judge accepted her evidence that she had left her siblings and
         mother in Somalia when she had left that country to seek asylum  in
         2005.

    (b)  Following her departure, the  Appellants  and  their  mother  (the
         father not having been involved with the family for many years  and
         his whereabouts being unknown) were separated  during  fighting  in
         Somalia and the Appellants were taken  by  neighbours  to  Ethiopia
         with a large number of the Somalis  fleeing  the  violence  at  the
         time.

    (c)  They had not had any contact with their  mother  since  they  were
         separated during the fighting in Somalia and  her  whereabouts  are
         unknown.

    (d)  The judge further accepted that the Sponsor was not aware  of  the
         whereabouts of either of the Appellants  until  a  person  she  had
         known when she herself was a refugee in Ethiopia, contacted her  to
         say that she believed her siblings were there with other Somalis.

    (e)  In 2011 around three or four  months  after  the  Appellants  fled
         Somalia to Ethiopia, the Sponsor made contact with  them  over  the
         telephone and arranged for them to  live  in  a  room  in  Ethiopia
         through the same friend.

    (f)  That the Sponsor sent  money  regularly  to  her  friend  for  the
         Appellants and from that money their rent, daily living costs and a
         small amount to pay for private tuition was covered as they did not
         attend school.  The amount varied to approximately US$200 or US$300
         per month.

62. As to the circumstances in which they were living the judge found  that
    it consisted of a room with mattresses on the floor and bags for  their
    clothing.  It was a room in a house that had five other  bedrooms  each
    of which contained a family and that the family shared one  toilet  and
    bathroom.  She described that:-

         "Cooking was done outside the house and water is  supplied  from  a
         tap outside the house.  The house does  have  electricity  and  the
         children are cared for by the  Sponsor's  friend,  Safi  Omar,  who
         cooks for them and generally looked  after  them.   The  Appellants
         have no family members in Ethiopia as far as they know."

63. The judge at [19] considered the money transfer receipts at page 61  of
    the bundle and accepted that whilst the  Appellants  had  not  provided
    evidence that they are not in contact with their mother, the judge  did
    not find that there was any evidence they  could  supply  to  establish
    this and the judge recorded that there was no reason to doubt the money
    transfer receipts even though they were of poor quality.

64. There is no dispute that I should consider the questions  addressed  by
    Lord Bingham in (Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 at paragraph 17.   Those
    questions are as follows:-

      i) Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public  authority
         with the exercise of the  Appellant's  right  to  respect  for  his
         private or (as the case may be) family life?

     ii) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity  as
         potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

    iii) If so, is its interference in accordance with the law?

     iv) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic  society  in
         the interests of national security, public safety or  the  economic
         wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,
         for the protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of
         rights and freedom of others?

         (v)If so, is such interference  proportionate  to  the   legitimate
         public end sought to be achieved?

65. In respect of the first question, that the  refusal  in  this  case  to
    allow the Appellants to join their sister in the United Kingdom  is  an
    interference with their Article 8 rights to respect for family life has
    also not been challenged by Mr Wilding.

66. Considering the second issue of  Razgar  "will  the  interference  have
    consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of
    Article 8", it has not been in  dispute  before  me  that  the  refusal
    decision amounts to an interference with that life and that it  crosses
    the minimum level of severity to engage Article 8(1).

67. As noted, once Article 8 is engaged, the focus moves to the process  of
    justification to Article 8(2).  It is common ground between the parties
    that the decision made in this case is in accordance with the  law  and
    it has not been suggested  that  the  Respondent's  decision  does  not
    further a legitimate  aim,  namely  proper  and  effective  immigration
    control.  The issue therefore  concerns  the  proportionality  of  that
    decision.

68. In determining  the  issue  of  proportionality,  both  Appellants  are
    minors.  Where an immigration decision engages Article  8  rights,  due
    regard must be had to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  An
    entry clearance decision for the admission of a child under 18  is  "an
    action  concerning  children  ...  undertaken  by  ...   administrative
    authorities".  And so by Article 3 "the best  interests  of  the  child
    should be a primary consideration".  Whilst it is settled law that  the
    statutory duty under Section 55 of the UK Borders Act 2009 only applies
    to children within the UK, the Secretary of  State  IDI  invites  Entry
    Clearance Officers to consider  the  statutory  guidance  issued  under
    Section 55 (see Mundeba (Section 55  and  paragraph  297(i)(f))  [2013]
    UKUT 00088 (IAC)).  In considering that issue, consideration  needs  to
    be given to the circumstances of the children in  the  light  of  their
    age, social background and development history and will involve enquiry
    as to whether there is evidence of neglect or abuse,  there  are  unmet
    needs  that  should  be  catered  for  and  whether  there  are  stable
    arrangements for the children's physical  care  (see  paragraph  37  of
    Mundeba (as cited)).

69.  I have set out in the preceding paragraphs the findings of  fact  made
    concerning the circumstances of the Appellants. I am not satisfied that
    there has been any cogent evidence to show that they  are  at  risk  of
    neglect or abuse, that there are any unmet needs that should be catered
    for and that at  the  date  of  decision  there  appear  to  be  stable
    arrangements for the children's physical  care.  Whilst  they  are  not
    living with a relative, the evidence is that they  are  living  with  a
    friend of the applicant and someone she felt able and confident  enough
    to entrust with their care and upbringing.  Whilst the findings of  the
    judge made reference to their living accommodation as  set  out  above,
    which is not ideal, they could properly  be  described  as  those  that
    generally prevail in Ethiopia and it would not be right to compare them
    with standards in the  United  Kingdom.  I  am  satisfied  that  on  an
    analysis of the evidence, including  the  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that their present needs can be met  in  Ethiopia  and  could
    continue to be met by the Sponsor who  the  judge  found  had  provided
    financial assistance  including an amount for private school  fees  and
    there is no evidence before me that that could  not  continue  if  they
    were not to enter the United Kingdom. They will  be  able  to  maintain
    their relationship with their sister by way  of  letters  and  possibly
    with visits to the United Kingdom.  I  take  in  to  account  that  the
    sponsor cannot return to Somalia but that does not  preclude  her  from
    living in Ethiopia. There has  been  no  evidence  by  was  of  country
    materials or evidence to demonstrate that the Appellants are unable  to
    live in Ethiopia even without leave and the factual matrix demonstrates
    that they have continued to live there  for  a  significant  length  of
    time.

70. Article 8 does not entail a general obligation for a State  to  respect
    an Appellant's choice of country of their residence  and  to  authorise
    family reunion in its territory. In the light of the findings  set  out
    above, the Appellants cannot meet the Immigration Rules.

71. Thus there is no evidence before the Tribunal that the Sponsor will  be
    able to meet the maintenance requirements and   the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance serves a legitimate aim of economic wellbeing,  if  not  also
    the maintenance of effect immigration control,  as  an  aspect  of  the
    prevention  of  crime  and  more  particularly  here   disorder.    The
    jurisprudence of Strasbourg makes  it  clear  that  in  conducting  the
    Article 8 balancing exercise the State is entitled  to  attach  adverse
    weight to the inability of an  applicant  to  meet  the  socio-economic
    requirements (see Konstatinov v the Netherlands App 161351/03).

72. When entry sought is sought for the  purpose  of  family  reunion,  the
    Immigration Rules laid before Parliament represents an attempt  by  the
    government to strike a fair balance between the rights to  respect  for
    family  life  and   immigration   control   which   includes   economic
    circumstances.   The  legitimate  aims  of  the  "maintenance  and  the
    integrity  of  the  UK  immigration  control"  gives  a  coherent   and
    consistently applied system and in particular that the Appellant  would
    be dependent on public funds and will be entitled to health  and  other
    benefits once in the United Kingdom, thus the economic wellbeing of the
    country is also a relevant issue when considering  proportionality  and
    the fact that the Appellant cannot meet the  Rules.   It  is  therefore
    within the states  margin  of  appreciation  to  set  those  Rules  and
    generally those Rules are proportionate. In this case the Rules set out
    the circumstances that must be met for entry clearance to  be  granted;
    not only that there exclusion is undesirable but also that they can  be
    accommodated and maintained in the UK  by the sponsor.

73. Consequently I am  required  to  have  regard  to  the  requirement  of
    predictability and certainty in  the  application  of  the  Rules.   In
    considering the issue of proportionality the decision of  Huang  [2007]
    UKHL  11,  referred  to  the  general  administrative  desirability  of
    applying known Rules if a  system  of  immigration  control  is  to  be
    workable, predictable, consistent and fair as between one applicant and
    another and that "the  damage  to  good  administration  and  effective
    control if a system is perceived by applicants  internationally  to  be
    unduly porous, unpredictable or perfunctory".  The legitimate aim under
    Article 8 in this  case  is  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the  country
    expressed as the maintenance of effective immigration  control  bearing
    in  mind  the  principle  of  applying  a  predictable  and  consistent
    application of the Immigration Rules.  As identified in the decision of
    Shahzad [2014] UKUT 85,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  not  only  an
    assessment at the individual "micro" level but also the  "macro  level"
    and that the general aspects of economic wellbeing include the need  to
    limit numbers who have access to public services and  the  benefits  of
    the NHS and who are able to compete for housing and for employment with
    those already in the UK (see FK and OK (Botswana) [2013] EWCA Civ 238).
    The public interest takes account of any potential economic burden upon
    the State by those seeking entry as stated at paragraph 11 of FK and OK
    (as cited ). In the decision of AAO v ECO [2001] EWCA Civ 840  at  [49]
    Rix LJ stated :

         "As  Strasbourg  and  domestic   jurisprudence   has   consistently
         emphasised (see above), states are entitled to have regard to their
         system  of  immigration  control  and  its   generally   consistent
         application, and a requirement that an entrant should be maintained
         without  recourse  to  public  funds  is  an  ultimately  fair  and
         necessary limitation on what  would  otherwise  become  a  possibly
         overwhelming burden on all of its citizens. It  is  an  unfortunate
         reality of life that states, especially one like the United Kingdom
         which  is  generally  accessible  and  welcoming  to  refugees  and
         immigrants, cannot undertake to allow all members of  a  family  to
         join together here, even those members who can show  emotional  and
         financial dependency, without creating unsupportable burdens."

74. In this respect, I accept that the factual circumstances were different
    . However, it  remains  the  case  that  there  is  significant  weight
    attached to the importance of the issue of whether  an  individual  may
    have recourse to public funds as an aspect of the public interest and I
    take into account that can give way when  the  facts  are  sufficiently
    compelling.  Notwithstanding the facts as  reached  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge and taking  into  account  my  assessment  also  of  the
    circumstances, I consider  that  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the
    legitimate aim and the protection of the economic of the country  is  a
    significant factor and I pay appropriate regard and weight to  it  when
    carrying out the balancing exercise as I must.  Such is made clear  now
    in the amendments made to the 2002 Act by the Immigration Act 2014  set
    out in 117A - D  which applies where a court or tribunal is required to
    determine whether  a  decision  made  under  the  Immigration  Acts-(a)
    breaches a person's right to respect for private and family life  under
    Article 8, and(b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of  the
    Human Rights Act 1998.  The public interest  considerations  applicable
    in all cases set out that  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    controls is in the public  interest  and  that  it  is  in  the  public
    interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic well-being
    of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in  the
    United Kingdom are financially independent,  because  such  persons-(a)
    are not a burden on taxpayers, and (b) are  better  able  to  integrate
    into society. They are, of course, only matters to  be  considered  and
    put in the balance.

75. Drawing together all of those matters  and  having  considered  all  of
    those factors identified above both in favour  of  the  Appellants  and
    those in favour of the Respondent, and  having  carried  out  an  even-
    handed application of the proportionality test, on the  specific  facts
    of these appeals, I find that the  balance  of  proportionality  is  in
    favour of the Respondent and  consequently  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    decision does strike a fair balance between the  Appellants'  interests
    and those of the Respondent.  Consequently, I am not satisfied that the
    decision would amount to a  sufficient  interference  to  outweigh  the
    legitimate aims of maintaining a proper system of  immigration  control
    and therefore the decisions are not disproportionate. Such  a  decision
    does not preclude the sponsor from supporting a further application  if
    either her circumstances or those  of  the  Appellants  change  in  the
    future.

Decision:

    The First-tier Tribunal made an error of  law.   The  decision  is  set
    aside.  The appeal is re-made as follows;  the  appeals  are  dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 grounds.


Direction regarding anonymity - rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration
Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted  anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or  any  member  of  their  family.  This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent. Failure to comply  with
this direction could lead to contempt of Court proceedings.
