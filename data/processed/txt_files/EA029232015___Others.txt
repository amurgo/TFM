                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In the light of Khan v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1775, the First-tier Tribunal Judge was wrong in law to
    conclude that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

 2. On 19th January 2019, Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Blum  issued  a  decision
    indicating that the Tribunal was minded to find an error  of  law,  set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and remit the  case
    to the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  Any party opposed to this course was
    directed to inform the Tribunal in writing not later than 28 days  from
    the date that direction was sent by the Upper Tribunal. There has  been
    no  communication  from  either  party,  save  for  a  request  by  the
    Appellant's representatives that the hearing date set  for  21st  March
    2018 be vacated, and I have therefore proceeded to  a  decision  as  to
    whether there is an error of law.

 3. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.

 4. The hearing of the 21st March 2018 in the Upper Tribunal is vacated.



Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law and his decision is set  aside.
 The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.


Signed      Helen Rimington                  Date 14th March 2018
