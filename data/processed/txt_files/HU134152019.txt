Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr  J  Knight,  legal  representative,  Duncan  Lewis
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 9 October 2020, I issued a decision in which I held that the  First-
    tier Tribunal  (Judge  Cameron)  had  erred  in  law  in  allowing  the
    appellant's appeal on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds.   I  set  aside  that
    decision in part and ordered that the decision on the appeal  would  be
    remade in the Upper Tribunal.  A copy of my first decision is  appended
    to this one and should be read in conjunction with it.

Background

 2. The appellant is a medium  offender  who  faces  deportation  from  the
    United Kingdom.  His primary route to avoiding deportation is to engage
    one  of  the  statutory  exceptions  in  s117C  of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").  He relies  -  as  he
    did before the FtT - on the first of those  exceptions.   In  order  to
    succeed, he must therefore establish that he has been lawfully resident
    in the UK for most of his life; that  he  is  socially  and  culturally
    integrated in  the  UK;  and  that  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to his reintegration to Jamaica.

Scope

 3. As I explained in my first decision, the  appellant  has  been  in  the
    United Kingdom since the age of four and  has  resided  lawfully  since
    then.  He was granted ILR in 2003, at which point  he  was  five  years
    old.  It has consequently not been in issue in  this  appeal  that  the
    appellant has been lawfully resident in the UK for most  of  his  life.
    The question of  whether  the  appellant  is  socially  and  culturally
    integrated in the UK was in issue between the parties before  the  FtT.
    The judge resolved that question in the appellant's favour and, at [24]-
    [29] of my first decision, I explained  why  I  did  not  consider  the
    respondent to have shown that this  conclusion  was  tainted  by  legal
    error.

 4. The judge also found in the appellant's favour in concluding that there
    would be very significant obstacles to his reintegration into  Jamaica.
    In that regard, I concluded that the judge had fallen into legal error.
    I set aside the FtT's decision in that respect only and  directed  that
    the Upper Tribunal would remake the decision to that extent, and  would
    also consider, insofar as it was necessary to do so, whether there were
    very compelling circumstances which sufficed  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest  in  the  appellant's  deportation.    In   statutory   terms,
    therefore, my task in this second decision  is  to  consider  only  the
    questions posed by s117C(4)(c) and s117C(6) of the 2002 Act.

 5. My task is further defined by the fact  that  a  number  of  the  FtT's
    findings of fact were not tainted by legal  error  and  were  expressly
    preserved in my first decision.  Those findings include the  following.
    The appellant, his stepmother and his elder sister had  given  credible
    evidence before the FtT: [83].  The appellant does not maintain contact
    with his family in Jamaica and he has no meaningful  relationship  with
    anyone in that country: [83].  He has no contact with  his  birthmother
    and there is no reason to think that the relationship with her  or  her
    family could be rekindled: [85] Neither the appellant  nor  his  family
    have returned to Jamaica since they  arrived  in  the  UK:  [84].   The
    appellant would have no real connection to the country other  than  the
    fact of his birth: [86].  His father has  mental  health  issues.   The
    appellant resides with a relative in the UK: [86].  The judge had  'not
    been provided with sufficient evidence' to make  a  decision  that  the
    appellant  could  receive  support  over  and  above   the   food   and
    accommodation he received in  the  UK:  [87].   He  receives  emotional
    support from the family he has  in  the  UK.   The  appellant  receives
    medication for his epilepsy but there was nothing  to  show  that  such
    treatment  would  be  unavailable  in  Jamaica:  [88].   Although   the
    appellant had undertaken education and courses in the  UK,  he  had  no
    meaningful links with Jamaicia which would assist him in  reintegrating
    there:  [89].   As  a  result  of  the  'considerable   crime   related
    environment', the appellant would be 'susceptible to criminal elements'
    in order to survive: [90]. Any relocation  assistance  would  not  last
    very long: [91].

Documentary Evidence

 6. Despite the clear and specific focus of this remaking hearing, the  232
    page bundle which was belatedly filed and  served  by  the  appellant's
    solicitors replicates much of the material which was  before  the  FtT.
    There are statements made by the appellant, his father, his mother, his
    aunt,  his  sister,  his  neighbour  and  his  cousin.   All  of  these
    statements were made for the hearing before the FtT, as  was  a  letter
    from the proprietor of a bakery  where  the  appellant  was  previously
    employed for a few months and a lady called  Ms  Smith,  who  works  to
    reduce gang violence in Wandsworth.

 7. There is some documentary evidence concerning the health of the various
    members of the appellant's family.  In respect of the appellant,  there
    is material from 2018 relating to  a  diagnosis  of  epilepsy  and  the
    treatment given in relation thereto.  In relation to his father,  there
    is a printout from  surgery  records  in  2018,  showing  that  he  had
    psychotic episodes  in  2014  and  2017  and  that  he  was  prescribed
    Olanzapine in 2018. In relation to the  appellant's  mother,  there  is
    evidence which had not been  before  the  FtT,  showing  that  she  had
    suffered a stroke or heart attack requiring 5 days inpatient  treatment
    in June 2020.

 8. There are also a  number  of  documents  relating  to  the  appellant's
    academic and vocational achievements in  the  UK,  before,  during  and
    after his time in prison.  A letter from his Probation Officer, written
    in 18 September 2020, suggested that the  appellant  had  engaged  well
    with supervision; that he was working towards a career in  the  fitness
    industry; and that he had a close and  supportive  family.   The  OASYS
    report which preceded that (written in December 2019) showed  that  the
    appellant presented a low risk of serious harm to all  but  members  of
    the public, in respect of whom he presented a medium risk.

 9. I had directed that the appellant's bundle should be filed  and  served
    21 days in advance of the hearing.  That  direction  was  sent  to  the
    parties on 18 January 2021, by email.  The purpose of  that  direction,
    as I made clear, was to ensure that the respondent had adequate time in
    which to consider the  appellant's  bundle  and  to  notify  the  Upper
    Tribunal if there were questions she wished to put to the appellant  or
    his witnesses.  I issued that direction with a view to ensuring that an
    informed view might be taken regarding the mode  of  hearing,  since  a
    remote hearing was unlikely to be suitable to the taking of contentious
    evidence from  multiple  witnesses.   In  the  event,  the  appellant's
    solicitors filed and served the bundle nine days  before  the  hearing.
    Thankfully, Mr Melvin confirmed at the start of the hearing  before  me
    that he had no questions for the appellant or his witnesses.    It  was
    in those circumstances that I heard submissions from Mr Knight, for the
    appellant, first.

Submissions

10. Mr Knight submitted that the only question which arose for decision was
    whether there were very significant obstacles to  the  appellant's  re-
    integration to Jamaica.  He asked me to consider the  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Lowe [2021] EWCA Civ 62 and to recall that  the  FtT
    had had the benefit  of  seeing  and  hearing  the  appellant  and  his
    witnesses give  evidence.   The  reality  of  the  case  was  that  the
    appellant had lived in the UK since the age  of  four  and  he  had  no
    knowledge of Jamaica.  It was obviously correct that he was of Jamaican
    origin and that he had lived with a Jamaican family in the  UK  but  he
    was to all intents and purposes an Englishman.  Even  if  he  had  been
    familiar with the country  when  he  left,  it  would  inevitably  have
    changed in the ensuing years.

11. Mr Knight submitted that Jamaica was a very violent  society  in  which
    the prospects of an individual re-integrating were closely tied to  who
    they knew.  The appellant's London accent would be  identified  and  he
    would be  regarded  as  a  failure.   This  would  leave  him  open  to
    exploitation as he would not be streetwise and would not  know  how  to
    react to the ordinary man  on  the  street.   He  would  be  unable  to
    understand the slang which was in use and would be a fish out of water.
     I asked Mr Knight to support these various assertions with evidence in
    the voluminous appellant's bundle but he initially declined to  do  so,
    stating that his submissions were based on common sense and  should  be
    accepted as such.

12. Mr Knight submitted that any support from the  authorities  in  the  UK
    would be unlikely to last long.  There was very  high  unemployment  in
    Jamaica and it would be  difficult  for  the  appellant,  with  his  UK
    qualifications, to find any work there.  I asked Mr Knight for evidence
    in support of any  of  these  assertions.   He  asked  me  to  draw  an
    inference from the respondent's Country  Information  and  Policy  Note
    entitled Jamaica: Fear of organised criminal groups.  It was clear,  he
    submitted that there must be high unemployment in Jamaica because there
    was  extensive  criminal  activity.   He  also  submitted   that   high
    unemployment must be the driver for the ongoing level of emigration  to
    the United Kingdom from Jamaica.  Again, this was all common sense,  he
    submitted.  Pressed by me to find  some  evidence  in  support  of  his
    submissions, Mr Knight eventually made reference to what is said  about
    unemployment and the high homicide rate in the CPIN.   The  country  is
    one of the most violent in the world, he submitted, and  the  appellant
    could not return safely.

13. Mr Knight submitted that the appellant would not receive any  financial
    support from his family in the United Kingdom.  Noting that this was  a
    submission which seemingly contradicted the finding of the FtT, I asked
    Mr Knight about the evidence upon which it  was  based.   He  submitted
    that the cost of supporting the appellant in Jamaica would  necessarily
    be higher than in  the  UK,  where  he  could  simply  share  food  and
    accommodation with other family members.  I asked him  to  develop  the
    submission with regard to  the  financial  ability  of  the  family  to
    support the appellant upon return.  He submitted that  the  appellant's
    sister could 'possibly' support him but  that  his  mother  and  father
    certainly could not, as they were both in low paid jobs.  I asked  what
    their jobs were.  Mr Knight did not know.  He  took  instructions,  and
    stated that the appellant's father was a cleaning  supervisor  and  his
    mother an NHS delivery manager.  He  submitted  that  they  had  little
    residual income after paying their bills but  he  had  no  evidence  in
    support of that submission.  At one point, he suggested that they  were
    dependent on benefits to  supplement  their  income,  although  he  was
    quickly disabused of that suggestion  by  the  appellant's  mother  and
    retracted the submission.

14. Mr Knight submitted that the appellant  would  be  ineligible  for  any
    financial support or healthcare from the Jamaican  authorities  due  to
    his length of absence from the country.   He  would  be  treated  as  a
    foreign national despite his Jamaican passport.  He was unable to  take
    me to any evidence in support of these submissions.

15. Mr Knight submitted that the appellant would be an outsider in  Jamaica
    and that  his  difficulty  integrating  into  society  there  would  be
    rendered all the more difficult by his epilepsy.  He would not have the
    emotional support of his family in the UK, because  his  mother  has  a
    poor internet connection and could not speak to him via Skype or  other
    forms of video  communication.   He  would  be  unable  to  reintegrate
    without encountering very significant obstacles.

16. Mr Melvin relied on his skeleton argument.  He had listed points  which
    suggested that it would not be very  difficult  for  the  appellant  to
    reintegrate into Jamaica notwithstanding his  length  of  absence  from
    that country. Despite the obvious significance of the point, there  had
    been nothing before the FtT to show that his family in the UK would  be
    unable to support the appellant whilst he found  his  way  in  Jamaica.
    That remained the case before the Upper Tribunal.  He  would  evidently
    be able to receive some emotional support from the UK as well, even  if
    that could not be by video link.

17. Mr Melvin submitted that the appellant's case was  largely  unsupported
    by any evidence and it was only when pressed that Mr  Knight  had  made
    some reference to the background material, which was in  any  event  of
    very  little  relevance.   The  appellant  had  relatives  in  Jamaica,
    including his birthmother and his uncle.  He could seek to make contact
    with either or both.   It  had  been  submitted  that  there  was  high
    unemployment in Jamaica but a quick internet search showed  that  rates
    were significantly down.  I observed to Mr Melvin that  the  respondent
    had served no evidence to this effect and  that  it  was  impermissible
    merely to cite material  he  had  found  on  the  internet  during  the
    hearing.  He responded,  firstly,  that  the  appellant  had  given  no
    notice, whether in the skeleton argument or otherwise, of an  intention
    to rely on the unemployment rate in Jamaica and, secondly, that it  was
    impermissible for the appellant  to  ask  the  Tribunal  to  treat  the
    unemployment rate in Jamaica as common sense or common knowledge.

18. Why, Mr  Melvin  asked  rhetorically,  would  the  appellant  be  in  a
    disadvantageous  position?   There  was  nothing  to  show   that   his
    transition to life in Jamaica would not be eased by  support  from  the
    Jamaican government, the appellant's family in the UK and  any  support
    package he would receive from  the  authorities  in  the  UK.   It  was
    notable, in any event, that there was no evidence to show that  neither
    the appellant nor his  family  had  returned  to  Jamaica  since  their
    arrival in the UK.  I asked Mr Melvin whether he was able to direct  me
    to evidence regarding the amount of support that  the  appellant  might
    receive from the UK authorities.  He directed me to that  part  of  the
    decision  letter  which  dealt  with  the  Facilitated  Returns  Scheme
    ("FRS").

19. Mr Knight replied that the appellant could not turn to his  birthmother
    in Jamaica as she had voluntarily given him up.  There was  no  contact
    between the appellant and his uncle in Jamaica; so much was clear  from
    his assertion that he had 'no one in Jamaica', at [3] of his  statement
    before the FtT.  It was accepted that the appellant would  be  eligible
    for a relocation or integration package.  Such packages  were  intended
    to assist returnees in reintegrating and setting up  a  business.   The
    appellant would receive �500 initially and could then apply for a grant
    to set up a business.

20. I reserved  my  decision  after  the  representatives  had  made  their
    submissions.

Legal Framework

21. As I have set out above, my focus in this appeal is on the first of the
    statutory exceptions to the deportation of medium offenders such as the
    appellant, whose index offences (possession of drugs of  class  A  with
    intent to supply and possession of a bladed article in a public  place)
    attracted a sentence of three years' detention  in  a  Young  Offenders
    Institution.  The exception is found in s117C(4) of the 2002 Act and is
    as follows:

         '(4) Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for
                  most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                  Kingdom, and

             (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
                  deported.'

22. The first two of those conditions are  not  in  issue  before  me.   In
    relation to the third, there is now an appreciable  body  of  authority
    from the Court of Appeal, much of which I cited in my  first  decision.
    The proper approach remains as set out in those  authorities.   I  will
    return in due course to what was said by the Court of Appeal  in  Lowe,
    the significance of which lies not in an analysis of  s117C(4)  or  the
    authorities in which  it  has  been  considered,  but  in  the  factual
    similarities between the two cases and the holding  that  it  had  been
    rationally open to the FtT to conclude on those facts that s117C(4) was
    satisfied.

23. When I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  and  directed
    that the decision on the appeal would be remade in the Upper  Tribunal,
    I had anticipated that submissions would be  made  on  the  alternative
    basis that there were very compelling circumstances in the  appellant's
    case which outweighed the public interest in deportation, such that the
    appellant could succeed under s117C(6).  Presumably in  recognition  of
    the threshold presented by that subsection, however, Mr Knight did  not
    seek to develop any such submissions in oral argument.

Analysis

24. There can be no  doubt  that  deportation  to  Jamaica  is  a  daunting
    prospect for the appellant, and for his  family,  who  speak  in  their
    statements about their concern  for  him  in  the  event  that  he  was
    required to return.  I proceed, as I have explained above, on the basis
    of the findings of fact which were made by Judge Cameron, who  had  the
    benefit of seeing and hearing the  appellant  and  his  witnesses  give
    evidence.  He was therefore uniquely well placed  to  conclude,  as  he
    did, that the appellant has no meaningful relationship with  anyone  in
    Jamaica and that he would have no family support on  the  island.   The
    judge also accepted the contention that the appellant  and  his  family
    have not returned to Jamaica since they came here  when  the  appellant
    was a small child.  Again, that finding of fact was open to  the  judge
    and cannot be revisited before me.

25. In the above  respects,  the  appellant's  case  certainly  bears  some
    similarities to that of the appellant in Lowe, in which  the  Court  of
    Appeal held that the Upper Tribunal had not been entitled to set  aside
    and revisit  the  conclusion  of  the  FtT  that  the  appellant  would
    encounter  very  significant  obstacles  to  reintegration.    Instead,
    McCombe LJ and Asplin LJ (with whom Phillips LJ  disagreed),  concluded
    that the Upper Tribunal had failed to identify any legal error  in  the
    decision of the FtT and had impermissibly substituted its own  view  on
    the facts.  The facts which led the First-tier Tribunal Judge Wilson in
    that case to conclude that there were  very  significant  obstacles  to
    that appellant's reintegration to Jamaica were reproduced  at  [18]  of
    McCombe LJ's judgment.  The  following  part  of  Judge  Wilson's  [31]
    contains the crux of his reasoning:

         "I accept that the Appellant speaks English which  is  one  of  the
         official languages of Jamaica. I accept the Appellant  is  a  young
         healthy man of working age who is educated. However, the  Appellant
         has grown up in, been educated in and spent his whole adult life to
         date in the UK. It is that length of time in the UK; that  lack  of
         any family or support in Jamaica; the Appellant never having  lived
         an independent life away  from  either  of  his  parents  or  state
         institutions and a lack of financial support which would allow  the
         Appellant to seek basic necessities  such  as  accommodation  which
         present significant obstacles to his integration into Jamaica."

26. Before me, Mr  Melvin  acknowledged  the  presence  of  many  of  these
    obstacles in the appellant's case.  He  was  correct  to  do  so.   The
    appellant has no reason to have any knowledge of life in Jamaica and he
    has no support network in that country.  The focus in the  respondent's
    submissions was therefore on the absence  of  evidence  to  demonstrate
    that this appellant would be unable to rely on support from his  family
    in the United Kingdom and from the authorities in  the  United  Kingdom
    and Jamaica to provide the basic necessities when he first returns  and
    seeks to make his way in an unfamiliar environment.

27. The finding made by the FtT regarding the ability  of  the  appellant's
    family in the UK to support him financially on return  to  Jamaica  was
    limited and somewhat opaque.  At [87], the judge noted that he had 'not
    been provided with sufficient evidence to make a decision that he would
    be able to be supported on return to Jamaica over and above the support
    of food and accommodation he gets here.'  It is not clear to me whether
    the judge concluded that the family would not be in a position to  send
    the appellant any financial support in Jamaica or whether they would be
    able to support him to obtain food and accommodation there.

28. Mr Melvin noted this lack of clarity in the preserved findings at [24]-
    [25] of his skeleton argument, noting in particular  that  it  was  not
    clear why the  appellant's  sister  could  not  support  the  appellant
    financially upon return.  On instructions, Mr Knight accepted before me
    that the appellant's sister could provide some support, although he was
    unable to provide further  details.   I  asked  about  the  appellant's
    mother and father in the United Kingdom.  Mr  Knight  initially  stated
    that they were both in low-paid  employment  and  would  be  unable  to
    provide any assistance.  In response to a further question, however, he
    was unable to give any indication of either their employment  or  their
    income, causing me to  question  the  evidential  basis  of  his  first
    response.  I allowed him to take further instructions on the point,  as
    a result of which he stated that the appellant's father is  a  cleaning
    supervisor and the appellant's mother is an NHS delivery manager.

29. Whilst I am prepared to accept that the appellant's  father's  position
    might aptly be categorised as low-paid  employment,  that  label  seems
    inappropriate for the appellant's mother's job.  Mr Knight was prepared
    to assume, without evidence, that the family had  insufficient  surplus
    income to provide any assistance to the appellant.  I am  not  prepared
    to make that assumption.  It is commonplace in immigration  appeals  to
    be presented with schedules of income and household expenditure  but  I
    have nothing of that kind before me and it would  be  inappropriate  to
    assume, in the face of evidence that one of the appellant's parents  is
    in a managerial position in the NHS,  that  they  have  no  ability  to
    provide some assistance for him during re-integration.  I conclude that
    the appellant could receive some financial assistance from  his  sister
    and his parents in the UK.

30. Mr Melvin also submitted that the appellant would be able to rely  upon
    the  Facilitated  Returns   Scheme   for   further   assistance.    The
    availability of such support was noted at the start of the respondent's
    decision, in the following terms:

         'Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS)

         You could return home under the Facilitated Return  Scheme  with  a
         reintegration package worth �1500 or  �750.   If  accepted  by  the
         scheme you will receive �500 in cash on departure.

         Contact the FRS team today on 020 8760 8513.

         If you do not currently have a valid passport you will need to  co-
         operate with the process for obtaining  a  document  to  facilitate
         your travel from the UK.'

31. I note that the importance of this scheme (in the context of protection
    appeals) has been underlined in country guidance decisions such as  MOJ
    & Ors (Return to Mogadishu) Somalia CG  [2014]  UKUT  00442  (IAC),  at
    [423], and AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2020] UKUT  130  (IAC),
    at [243]-[246].

32. Mr Melvin was not in a position to explain precisely what support might
    be available.  Mr Knight  was  able  to  assist  as  a  result  of  his
    experience from other cases, however, and  stated  that  the  appellant
    would receive �500 initially and could then apply for a grant to set up
    a business.

33. Mr Knight submitted that the appellant would not be eligible to receive
    any support from the Jamaican state, whether by way of social security,
    accommodation or healthcare.  He asserted that  this  was  because  the
    appellant would be treated by the Jamaican  authorities  as  a  foreign
    citizen, despite his Jamaican nationality, as a result of the length of
    time he had spent in the UK.  Mr Knight was unable to cite any evidence
    in support of this submission and resorted, as he did on  a  number  of
    occasions during his submissions, to  a  claim  that  this  was  either
    common knowledge or that it was common sense to reach this  conclusion.
    There was, in truth, no proper basis for this submission and it  should
    not have been made.  There is no reason  to  think  that  the  Jamaican
    authorities would cut the appellant adrift because he has  been  living
    in the United Kingdom since the age of four and there is no evidence to
    suggest that there is anything other than a functioning  welfare  state
    in Jamaica to which the appellant could turn if the need arose.

34. Mr Knight relied on what he said would be  the  appellant's  inevitable
    difficulty in securing employment in Jamaica.   I  accept,  of  course,
    that the appellant has no experience  of  the  labour  market  in  that
    country and  that  his  experience  of  lawful  employment  in  the  UK
    comprises a few months working in a  bakery,  the  general  manager  of
    which described him as  a  'very  polite,  conscientious  and  reliable
    individual' (Mr Bevir's letter of 23 October 2018 refers, at page 73 of
    the appellant's bundle).  The  appellant  has  academic  qualifications
    from the  UK,  however,  and  there  is  no  evidence  to  support  the
    submission made by Mr Knight that these qualifications would be held in
    any lower esteem than  comparable  ones  which  had  been  obtained  in
    Jamaica.  The appellant is therefore a young man  with  nine  GCSEs,  a
    Prince's  Trust  Certificate  in  Employment,  Teamwork  and  Community
    Skills, a professional qualification  in  Fitness  Instruction,  and  a
    positive employment reference from an employer the United Kingdom.  His
    ambition, were he to remain in  the  United  Kingdom,  is  to  start  a
    business in the fitness industry.

35. Mr Knight relied on a submission that there was  a  high  incidence  of
    unemployment in Jamaica.  In support of that submission, he  relied  on
    the only piece of background evidence which has been  adduced  in  this
    appeal: the 2019 CPIN to which I have previously referred.  Although Mr
    Knight was not immediately able to refer me to  the  salient  parts  of
    this report, I accept that  it  shows  that  unemployment  is  high  in
    Jamaica: 3.1.3 and 3.3.4 refer.

36. Mr Knight also made reference, as he had before the FtT, to the  levels
    of crime in Jamaica.   Having  considered  the  CPIN  in  detail,  with
    particular focus on those sections to which I was particularly directed
    by Mr Knight, I accept that the levels of crime - and violent crime  in
    particular - are high in Jamaica.  Violence is described  at  3.3.3  of
    the report as 'endemic among poor black communities'.  There is said to
    be a serious risk from violence  in  Kingston,  which  is  particularly
    acute  in  the  'garrison'  communities  in  the  capital,  which   are
    controlled not by the Jamaican authorities but by 'dons' who are linked
    to the political representatives in the area:  3.1.2,  5.2  and  6.3.1.
    There are thought to be 200 or more gangs on the island, some of  which
    have involvement in so-called 'lotto scamming' (4.2.5) and the trade in
    narcotics and firearms: 4.1.   Planned  kidnapping  of  high-net  worth
    individuals and targets of opportunity is also a phenomenon: 4.2.2.

37. Drawing these threads together, I accept that there are clear obstacles
    to the appellant's  re-integration  to  Jamaica.   He  has  no  support
    network there.  He has no real experience of life on  the  island.   He
    speaks the language but he will have no knowledge of the level or  type
    of criminality or of the garrison communities which exist in  Kingston.
    He has no experience of the education system or of the  labour  market.
    There are, in any event, high levels of unemployment which will  hinder
    his chances of ensuring that he is able to provide for himself.

38. These obstacles will be offset,  however,  by  the  support  which  the
    appellant will be able to rely upon from the United Kingdom.  It is not
    established that his parents will be unable  to  support  him.   It  is
    accepted that his sister can do so.  He will also receive a small grant
    from the FRS scheme.  There is no evidence to show that he cannot  turn
    to the Jamaican authorities for assistance  if  required.   Unlike  the
    appellant in Lowe, the appellant will not  be  unable  to  receive  the
    basic necessities of life. I do not accept that the appellant  will  be
    without food or shelter when he returns to Jamaica; he can count on his
    family in this country  to  rally  around  and  assist  him  whilst  he
    resettles.  He has qualifications of various descriptions and he has  a
    plan to establish a business in the UK.  If he returns to  Jamaica,  he
    can apply for a grant to enable him to bring  that  plan  to  fruition.
    There is no reason to think that the personal fitness industry  is  any
    less popular in Jamaica than it is in the United Kingdom.

39. The test in s117C(4)(c) concerns not only board and  lodging,  however.
    Sales LJ (as he then was) explained in SSHD v Kamara  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    813; [2016]  4  WLR  152  how  the  statutory  test  requires  a  broad
    evaluative judgment of "whether the individual will  be  enough  of  an
    insider in terms of understanding how life in the society in that other
    country is carried on and a capacity to participate in  it,  so  as  to
    have a reasonable opportunity to be  accepted  there,  to  be  able  to
    operate on a day-to-day basis in that society and to build up within  a
    reasonable time a variety of human relationships to give  substance  to
    the individual's private or family life."

40. The appellant will not return to Jamaica as an insider but it would  be
    wrong, in my judgment, to categorise him as  Mr  Knight  did.   He  has
    grown up amongst family members in  the  Jamaican  diaspora  and  I  am
    unable to accept that he would not have some familiarity with  Jamaican
    culture.  Even if he could not connect to his  mother  and  father  via
    Skype in the UK, he could speak to them on the telephone and seek their
    emotional support and guidance as he re-integrates to Jamaica.  As  the
    FtT found, there is inadequate evidence to suggest  that  his  epilepsy
    would hinder him in his attempts to  re-integrate.   He  would  not  be
    required, with the support he would receive from the UK, to live in the
    most dangerous communities in Kingston.  Nor would he  be  required  to
    live what Mr Knight describes in his skeleton argument as  a  'life  of
    destitution'.

41. I do not accept that the appellant would be unable to adapt to life  in
    Jamaica because he has no support network  upon  which  to  build.   Mr
    Knight submitted that an individual's ability to get by in Jamaica  was
    contingent upon a 'who you know' culture.  Whilst  there  is  certainly
    some  support  for  that  submission  in  relation  to   the   garrison
    communities  in  Kingston,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  that  it
    dominates the island as a whole.  The evidence simply does not paint  a
    picture of a society which is comparable in that  respect  to  Albania,
    for example (see AM & BM (Albania) CG [2010] UKUT 80 (IAC), at  [165]).
    I see no reason why a young man who is said to be 'amazing in terms  of
    his reliability, attitude and  work'  (page  N56  of  the  respondent's
    bundle refers) could not build up  a  variety  of  human  relationships
    within a reasonable time.

42. Considering the position as a whole, and adopting  the  forward-looking
    focus which the subsection requires, I do consider that  the  appellant
    will have a reasonable  opportunity  to  be  accepted  in  Jamaica,  to
    operate on a day to day basis and to build up within a reasonable  time
    a  variety  of  human  relationships.    Whilst   re-integration   will
    necessarily  be  difficult,  I  do  not  accept  that  there  are  very
    significant  obstacles  to  the  appellant's  re-integration  into  the
    country of his birth and nationality.

43. It follows that I do not accept that the first statutory  exception  to
    deportation applies to the appellant.  He does not seek to suggest that
    he has any relationships which  bring  him  within  the  scope  of  the
    second.

44. As I have noted above, Mr Knight made no oral submission that there are
    very compelling circumstances which outweigh the public interest in the
    appellant's  deportation.   I  nevertheless  consider  that   question,
    because it remains necessary in principle to conduct a full  article  8
    ECHR proportionality assessment: HA (Iraq) [2020] EWCA Civ 1176; [2021]
    1 WLR 1327, at [59].  There can be no doubt  that  Article  8  ECHR  is
    engaged in its private and family life aspects by the deportation of  a
    young adult who continues to live with his  family  and  who  has  been
    raised in this country.

45. There is a very strong  public  interest  in  the  deportation  of  the
    appellant.  He was convicted of being concerned in the supply of  class
    A drugs twice.  The second such offence (and the possession of a bladed
    article in a police  station)  took  place  whilst  he  was  serving  a
    suspended sentence.  These are serious offences and  the  more  serious
    the  offence  committed,  the  greater  the  public  interest  in   the
    deportation of the criminal: s117C(2) refers, as considered in Akinyemi
    [2019] EWCA Civ 2098; [2020] 1 WLR 1843.   The appellant's sentence  of
    three years'  custody  places  him  in  the  upper  range  for  'medium
    offenders'.

46. Various matters might properly have been  said  to  weigh  against  the
    appellant's deportation, or to  reduce  the  public  interest  in  that
    course, in the balance sheet of proportionality.  It will be  difficult
    for him to reintegrate into Jamaica, even if that difficulty  does  not
    reach the elevated threshold in the statutory exception.  He has  spent
    the majority of his life lawfully in the UK, since he was a young child
    (Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, read with Akinyemi  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    236; [2017] 1 WLR 3118). There was a period of years  within  which  he
    would have been eligible to apply to become naturalised  as  a  British
    citizen. He committed his various offences as a young man and his final
    sentence was to be served in a  Young  Offenders'  Institution,  rather
    than a prison  (Maslov  v  Austria).   He  represents  a  low  risk  of
    reoffending and seems to have distanced himself from his  former  peers
    and a pro-criminal lifestyle involving the use and supply of drugs:  HA
    (Iraq), at [141]. He has a supportive family, who will be devastated by
    his deportation.  His mother and  his  father  have  health  conditions
    which only serve to increase the distress which will  be  felt  by  the
    family.

47. Weighing all of these matters as I am required to do,  I  come  to  the
    clear conclusion that the weight of the public interest in this case is
    such as to outweigh those matters  on  the  appellant's  side  by  some
    margin.  Despite his arrival in the UK as a young man and his age  when
    his offending was committed, there remains a  strong  public  interest,
    underscored by primary legislation, in the deportation of an individual
    who received a custodial sentence of three years.  I  do  not  consider
    that public interest to be outweighed by the difficulties and  distress
    which the appellant's deportation will cause him and  his  family.   Mr
    Knight did not attempt to submit orally that the appellant had the sort
    of 'very strong claim indeed' which would be required to  overcome  the
    public interest (Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60; [2016] 1 WLR 4799, at [14],
    refers).  For the reasons above, I consider that he was correct not  to
    have pursued any such submission.

48. Section 117B of the 2002 Act does not serve to increase the  weight  of
    the public interest in this appellant's  deportation.   He  has  always
    remained lawfully, he speaks English and he does not represent a burden
    on public funds.  Be that as it may, the extent of the public  interest
    in his deportation  as  a  result  of  his  criminality  is  such  that
    deportation is the proper and proportionate course.

49. The appellant is unable to show that he meets the statutory  exceptions
    to deportation.  He is unable to show that there  are  very  compelling
    circumstances which outweigh the public interest  in  his  deportation.
    In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Tufan, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Knight, Solicitor of Duncan Lewis & Co


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals, with permission granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Saffer, against a decision which was  issued  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Cameron ("the judge") on 19 February 2020, allowing
    Mr Skeffrey's appeal against the  respondent's  refusal  of  his  human
    rights claim.

 2. To avoid confusion, I shall refer to the parties as  they  were  before
    the  First-tier  Tribunal;  Mr  Skeffrey  as  the  appellant,  and  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent.

Relevant Background

 3. The full background is set out very clearly within the judge's decision
    and I do not propose to rehearse it.  It suffices for present  purposes
    to note the following.

 4. The appellant is a Jamaican national who was born on 24 February  1998.
    He arrived in the UK in 2002, aged four,  and  was  granted  Indefinite
    Leave to Remain ("ILR") in September 2003.  He  has  lived  in  the  UK
    since his arrival, and has not returned to Jamaica.  He has convictions
    for a number of criminal offences, the most serious of which  concerned
    the possession of drugs (cannabis and heroin) with intent to supply and
    the possession of a bladed article.  For those offences, and an offence
    of breaching an earlier suspended sentence, the  appellant  received  a
    sentence of 3 years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institution.

 5.  Following  an  exchange  of  correspondence,  the  respondent  made  a
    deportation order against the appellant on 9 July  2019.   On  23  July
    2019, she refused the human rights claim which the appellant  had  made
    in response to her stated intention  to  deport  him  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  It was against that refusal that the  appellant  appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant attended the hearing before the FtT,  represented  by  Mr
    Knight.  The  respondent  was  represented  by  a  Presenting  Officer.
    Comparatively large bundles of documentary evidence had been  filed  by
    both parties.  Mr Knight had prepared a skeleton argument.   The  judge
    heard  oral  evidence  from  the  appellant  and  his  family   members
    (stepmother and  sister).   He  heard  closing  submissions  from  both
    representatives before he reserved his decision.

 7. In his reserved decision, the judge  summarised  the  evidence  he  had
    received in oral and  documentary  form.   He  made  reference  to  the
    relevant paragraphs of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  Part  5A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  He also cited Hesham Ali
    v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60; [2016] 1 WLR 4799 and MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013]
    EWCA Civ 1192; [2014] 1 WLR 544.

 8. At [27], the judge noted that this was not  a  case  in  which  it  was
    submitted that the appellant could  benefit  from  the  second  (family
    life)  exception  to  deportation,   as   he   had   neither   parental
    responsibility for a child nor a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
    with a qualifying partner.  The judge therefore  proceeded,  from  [28]
    onwards, to focus on the appellant's submission that he met  the  first
    (private life) exception to deportation.  It was obviously accepted  by
    the respondent that he had been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom
    for most of his life.  The remaining questions, as posed  by  s117C(4),
    were whether the appellant was socially and  culturally  integrated  in
    the  United  Kingdom  and  whether  there  would  be  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant's integration into Jamaica.

 9. Having set out the evidence which bore upon those questions, and having
    reminded himself of the appellant's offending background in detail, the
    judge turned to  analyse  the  questions  presented  by  s117C(4).   In
    relation to social and cultural  integration,  under  s117C(4)(b),  the
    judge noted that it was the respondent's submission that 'the appellant
    due to  his  criminal  convictions  has  not  socially  and  culturally
    integrated  into  the  UK.':  [77].   The  judge  accepted   that   the
    appellant's offending was serious and that he had breached  an  earlier
    suspended sentence.  He took into account the  sentencing  remarks  and
    the OASys report, which stated that the appellant  presented  a  medium
    risk of reoffending and a medium risk of serious harm.  His conclusions
    on this part of the statutory exception were as follows:

         "[79] As indicated, the appellant came to this country when he  was
         four years old and has therefore spent the formative years in  this
         country including his education.  The appellant is  approaching  22
         years of age and has  therefore  spent  nearly  18  years  in  this
         country.

         [80] Although the appellant commenced offending in  2015  and  that
         offending appears to have escalated given that  the  index  offence
         was committed whilst on a suspended sentence and the possession  of
         a bladed article occurred whilst the appellant was also on bail for
         further drug offences, I am not satisfied that the offending itself
         can be said to show that the appellant has not integrated into this
         country in view of the fact that he came here at a very  young  age
         and spent his formative years here.

         [81] I am therefore satisfied that the appellant has been  in  this
         country lawfully for more than half  his  life,  and  that  he  has
         integrated into the  UK  socially  and  culturally.   The  question
         therefore which arises is  whether  or  not  there  would  be  very
         significant obstacles to  his  integration  into  Jamaica  were  he
         returned there."

10. Before leaving the  judge's  treatment  of  the  second  limb  of  this
    statutory exception, I should also note what he said at [92] (after  he
    had dealt with the next  question,  of  whether  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles to the appellant's  re-integration  to  Jamaica).
    Whilst its placement in the  decision  is  unusual,  it  also  contains
    relevant analysis of this limb:

         "I am satisfied that given the appellant has been here for a period
         of some 18 years and given that he  has  formed  relationships  and
         friendships in this  country  that  he  has  integrated  into  this
         country both socially and culturally.   I  do  not  find  that  his
         offending notwithstanding that the index offence is drug  offending
         that the overall offending is such that it could be  said  that  he
         had not culturally integrated into this country."

11. The judge turned immediately to  the  third  aspect  of  the  statutory
    exception.  He noted that there had been consistent evidence about  the
    family, including the appellant, having no real connections in  Jamaica
    and that the appellant had not returned since arriving as a  four  year
    old boy: [82]-[84].  The judge noted that the  appellant  had  no  ties
    with Jamaica and that although his 'birthmother' remained there,  there
    was no reason to think that he would be able  to  re-establish  contact
    with her or with any other potential  maternal  family  members:  [85].
    The appellant would accordingly be returned 'as a single young man with
    no real connection to the country': [86].  The judge  stated  that  the
    appellant received support from his family in the UK but he had not, he
    said, been provided with sufficient evidence to make a decision that he
    would be supported in Jamaica 'over and above the support of  food  and
    accommodation he gets here': [87].   The  judge  also  noted  that  the
    appellant received emotional support from his family  in  the  UK.   He
    attached no significance to the appellant's epilepsy, since  there  was
    nothing before him to indicate that medication would be unavailable  in
    Jamaica: [88].  Although the appellant had taken courses in the UK  but
    he had no meaningful links to Jamaica which he could use to assist  him
    in reintegrating: [89].   Having  taken  account  of  the  respondent's
    background evidence on Jamaica, the judge expressed some  concern  that
    the appellant would be 'susceptible to criminal elements in Jamaica  in
    order to survive.': [90].   The  relocation  assistance  to  which  the
    appellant might be entitled would not last  very  long  and  would  not
    enable the appellant 'to successfully integrate  into  that  country.':
    [91].

12. The remainder of the decision contains a brief analysis of the question
    of whether there are very compelling circumstances over and above those
    in the statutory exceptions which are capable of outweighing the public
    interest in the appellant's  deportation  (s117C(6)  of  the  2002  Act
    refers).  Since Mr Knight very properly accepted  before  me  that  the
    decision could not be sustained on  this  alternative  basis  alone,  I
    shall say no more about those concluding paragraphs.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

13. The respondent's grounds do not contain  a  tight  formulation  of  the
    propositions advanced.  The seven paragraphs of grounds  are  not  even
    numbered.  The importance of properly formulated grounds of appeal  has
    been emphasised by this Tribunal and by the Court of Appeal in Harverye
    v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 2848 and WA (Pakistan) v SSHD  [2019]  EWCA  Civ
    302.  The Upper Tribunal is entitled to expect more, particularly  from
    the Secretary of State, with all the resources she has at her disposal.
     On analysis, however, the grounds  of  appeal  may  be  summarised  as
    follows:

      1) The judge erred in failing  to  consider  whether  the  appellant's
         offending had broken his integrative links to  the  United  Kingdom
         and had failed to provide adequate reasons for his  conclusions  on
         integration to the UK.

      2) The judge had misdirected himself in law  and  failed  to  consider
         material matters in his assessment of re-integration to Jamaica.

14.  Mr  Tufan  developed  these  grounds  briefly  in  his  concise   oral
    submissions.  He submitted that the  judge  had  failed  to  apply  the
    approach in a number of authorities, including Binbuga  v  SSHD  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 551; [2019] Imm AR 1026, AM (Somalia) v SSHD [2019]  EWCA  Civ
    774; [2019] 4 All ER 714 and SSHD v  Bossade  [2015]  UKUT  415  (IAC);
    [2015] Imm AR 1281.  The judge had failed, in particular,  to  consider
    the appellant's present level of integration, the importance  of  which
    was highlighted at [88] of AM (Somalia).

15. I asked Mr Tufan for submissions on CI (Nigeria) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ
    2027; [2020] INLR  191.   He  accepted  that  this  was  a  significant
    decision and had nothing further to add in respect of the first ground.
     On the second ground, he  submitted  that  the  judge's  reasoning  in
    respect of 'very significant  obstacles'  was  deficient,  in  that  it
    contained no clear indication of  the  threshold  applied,  whether  by
    reference to authority or otherwise.   Mr Tufan cited the  decision  of
    the Court of Appeal in Mwesezi v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ  1104,  in  which
    there was no error on the part of the  FtT  in  concluding  that  there
    would not be very significant obstacles to the appellant  reintegrating
    into Uganda, which he had left at the age of two.

16. Mr Knight submitted that the judge was very experienced and that  there
    was no error of law in his decision.  The judge was not required to set
    out a list of authorities and what mattered was that he had applied the
    law correctly.  The facts  of  the  case  spoke  for  themselves.   The
    appellant had arrived in the UK at the age of four and had committed no
    crimes until the age of seventeen.  He was plainly fully integrated  to
    the UK.  Unlike in Binbuga, there was no suggestion of gang membership.
     The appellant had been a drug addict but he was  now  recovered.   His
    entire family, apart from his birthmother, were in the UK, and  it  had
    been  accepted  by  the  judge  that  they  had  no  contact  with  his
    birthmother.  She had relinquished responsibility for the appellant  at
    a young age.  All of these points had been understood by the judge  and
    he had made findings of fact in the appellant's favour.  There  was  no
    reason to interfere with the decision, which had been properly open  to
    the judge.

17. I asked Mr Knight how he met Mr Tufan's submission that  there  was  no
    indication in the  judge's  decision  of  the  threshold  presented  by
    s117(4)(c).  He accepted that there was no consideration of that point,
    or of any relevant authority, in the judge's decision, but he submitted
    that the threshold had been made clear to the  judge  in  the  skeleton
    argument for the FtT.  I asked Mr Knight to assist me with the location
    of that point in the skeleton.  He eventually drew my attention to  the
    citation of Bank Mellatt v Her Majesty's Treasury (No  2)  [2013]  UKSC
    39; [2014] 1 AC 700, although he did accept that this decision  was  of
    very little assistance on the  construction  of  a  specific  statutory
    provision of deportation law.  Mr  Knight  accepted  that  no  relevant
    authority on s117C(4)(c) was drawn to the judge's  attention.   He  did
    submit, however, that the judge had borne a number of relevant facts in
    mind and that he had been entitled, in the circumstances, to find  that
    the appellant satisfied the third limb of the statutory exception.

18. In response, Mr Tufan submitted that there was no consideration of  the
    very significant obstacles threshold on the part of the  judge  and  he
    had, in any event, overlooked the fact that the appellant retained  the
    tie of nationality, which was a significant matter.

19. I reserved my decision at the end of submissions.

Statutory Framework

20. Since the appellant is a medium offender[1] who has  available  to  him
    the statutory exceptions to deportation, his appeal fell to be  allowed
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds, without more, if he could  satisfy  s117C(4)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   That  subsection
    is in the following terms:

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for
                  most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                  Kingdom, and

             (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
                  deported.

Analysis

21. I do not consider the judge to have fallen into error as  contended  in
    the first of the respondent's grounds.  He did not cite Binbuga or  the
    authorities to which Ms Tufan referred but he was clearly cognisant  of
    the nature  of  the  respondent's  submissions  in  this  regard.   The
    respondent submitted that the appellant had demonstrated, by his repeat
    offending, that he had severed his  integrative  links  to  the  United
    Kingdom.  The judge clearly took that submission into account and  made
    a  finding  of  fact,  at  [81]  and  [92],  that  the  appellant   was
    nevertheless socially and culturally integrated.

22. It is relevant to recall, in this context, what was  recently  said  by
    Leggatt LJ (with whom Hickinbottom  LJ  and  the  Senior  President  of
    Tribunals agreed) in CI (Nigeria).  At [56], Leggatt LJ confronted  the
    very question of principle at issue in  this  case:  'how  the  offence
    committed by a foreign criminal and sentences of  imprisonment  imposed
    for those offences are relevant to the  test  of  social  and  cultural
    integration'.  At [57], Leggatt LJ underlined the need to bear in  mind
    the rationale behind the  test,  which  he  stated  was  'to  determine
    whether the person concerned has established a private life in  the  UK
    which has a substantial claim to protection under Article 8'.  At [58],
    having referred to Uner  v  The  Netherlands  (2007)  45  EHRR  14,  he
    considered the multifaceted nature of the  enquiry,  which  encompassed
    not only relevant social ties but also the familiarity with the  shared
    values of the community.  He referred, by reference to Maslov v Austria
    (2008) 47 EHRR 20, to the special situation of aliens  who  have  spent
    most or all of their childhood in the host country.

23. At [60]-62], Leggatt LJ considered the significance  of  offending  and
    imprisonment in the s117C(4)(b) enquiry.  Recalling what had been  said
    in Binbuga, he accepted that an individual  could  not  place  positive
    reliance on associations with pro-criminal  groups  in  an  attempt  to
    demonstrate integration.  At [61], Leggatt LJ held that  offending  and
    imprisonment were also 'in principle relevant insofar as they  indicate
    that the person concerned lacks (legitimate) social and  cultural  ties
    in the UK'.  At [62], however, he stated:

         "Clearly, however, the impact of offending and imprisonment upon  a
         person's integration in this country will depend not  only  on  the
         nature and frequency of the offending,  the  length  of  time  over
         which it takes place and the length of time spent  in  prison,  but
         also on whether and how deeply  the  individual  was  socially  and
         culturally integrated in the UK to begin with. In  that  regard,  a
         person who has lived all or almost all his life in the UK, has been
         educated here, speaks no language other than (British) English  and
         has no familiarity with any other society  or  culture  will  start
         with much deeper roots in this country than someone who  has  moved
         here at a later age. It is hard to see how criminal  offending  and
         imprisonment could ordinarily, by themselves and unless  associated
         with  the  breakdown  of  relationships,  destroy  the  social  and
         cultural integration of someone whose entire  social  identity  has
         been formed in the UK. No doubt it is  for  this  reason  that  the
         current guidance ("Criminality: Article 8 ECHR  cases")  that  Home
         Office  staff  are  required  to  use  in  deciding   whether   the
         deportation of a foreign criminal would breach  article  8  advises
         that:

             "If the person has been resident in the UK from a  very  early
             age it is unlikely that offending alone would mean a person is
             not socially and culturally integrated.""

24. The judge did not cite this, or any, authority but his approach to  the
    question posed by s117C(4)(b) was precisely in line with  CI  (Nigeria)
    and the guidance cited by Leggatt LJ.  The appellant came to the United
    Kingdom when he was four.  He enjoyed ILR from the age of five.  He was
    educated and brought up here, gaining a number of GCSEs.  As the  judge
    also noted, he continues to have relationships and friendships  in  the
    country, as one would expect in  these  circumstances.   His  offending
    took place over a three year period, between the autumn of 2015 and the
    spring of 2018.  As a result of the index offence, he was to spend less
    than eighteen months in a Young Offender's Institution.  (As  is  clear
    from HHJ Plaschkes QC's sentencing remarks, the appellant was to  serve
    half of the total  sentence  of  detention  before  being  released  on
    licence, but he also received a deduction of 105 days  from  that  term
    because he had spent 210 days  on  a  qualifying  curfew.)   The  total
    amount of time in custody for  the  offence  was  therefore  around  15
    months.

25. The enquiry under s117C(4)(b) is highly  fact-sensitive,  as  is  clear
    from the decision of the Court of Appeal in AM (Somalia),  at  [73]  in
    particular. The judge at first instance in that case  was  entitled  to
    find that the offender's significant offending over  a  lengthy  period
    constituted a 'serious discontinuity' in the integration he had accrued
    since arriving in the UK at  the  age  of  two.   The  judge  at  first
    instance in this appeal was, in my  judgment,  entitled  to  reach  the
    opposite conclusion.  There is no indication in his  decision  that  he
    adopted an approach which was at odds with the authorities  and  it  is
    not established, in particular, that he focussed entirely on the  past,
    as Mr Tufan was at one point minded to submit.  The judge plainly  took
    into account the current position; so much is clear from his evaluation
    of the significance of the appellant's offending.

26. For all of these reasons, I reject the  respondent's  first  ground  of
    appeal and conclude that the judge was entitled to  conclude,  for  the
    reasons that he gave, that the appellant  is  socially  and  culturally
    integrated into the UK.

27. I do find that the judge  fell  into  error  in  his  consideration  of
    s117C(4)(c), however.  It was a signal feature of this  case  that  the
    judge received very little assistance from the parties on the vast body
    of case-law concerning the deportation of foreign criminals.  There  is
    no reference to authority in the letter of  refusal.   The  grounds  of
    appeal and the case summary contain nothing of assistance.

28.  The  skeleton  argument  which  was  given  to  the  judge  is   quite
    astonishing, in that it runs to twenty pages of single-spaced type  and
    contains not a single reference to  any  decided  case  on  the  public
    interest in the deportation of foreign nationals under Part 5A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Rather than  citing  any
    of the cases from the Upper Tribunal or the Court of Appeal  on  s117C,
    there is reference to Bulale v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 806; [2009] QB 536,
    a case concerning deportation under the regime applicable  to  European
    nationals.  There is also, inexplicably, lengthy citation from Mugwagwa
    [2011] UKUT 338, concerning the proper approach to  certificates  under
    s72 of the 2002 Act.  There was no such certificate in this  case,  nor
    had there ever been any suggestion of  an  asylum  claim.   There  were
    cases cited concerning  the  separate  scheme  (under  the  Immigration
    Rules) for the revocation of deportation orders, including Smith [2017]
    UKUT 166 (IAC) and SSHD v ZP (India) [2015] EWCA Civ 1197; [2016] 4 WLR
    35.  The relevant statutory scheme was finally set out at page  14  but
    the  authorities  which  were  then  drawn  to  the  judge's  attention
    (including Hesham Ali) all concerned the statutory framework  preceding
    the insertion of Part 5A by the Immigration Act 2014.

29. It seems that no relevant authority was drawn to the judge's  attention
    in  relation  to  s117C  in  the   oral   submissions   made   by   the
    representatives.  If he was to apply the law correctly,  therefore,  it
    was for the judge to perform the task of  the  representatives  and  to
    ascertain for himself what  guidance  had  been  given  on  the  proper
    approach to these statutory provisions. He should not have been  placed
    in that position by either side.

30. In respect of s117C(4)(b), the judge fortuitously adopted  the  correct
    approach when he found  that  the  appellant  remained  culturally  and
    socially integrated.  As I have explained  above,  the  approach  which
    underpinned his  conclusions  was  consonant  with  CI  (Nigeria).   In
    respect of  s117C(4)(c),  however,  he  fell  into  error  because  his
    decision demonstrates no consideration of the threshold  of  difficulty
    (very significant obstacles) required by that limb of  the  test.   The
    judge certainly considered relevant factors; so much is clear from  the
    parts of the decision which I have set out or  summarised  above.   The
    fact that the appellant had not been to Jamaica since the age of  four,
    the absence of  contact  with  family  members  there,  the  short-term
    support which might be provided by the relocation package  provided  by
    the UK; all of these were undoubtedly relevant to the judge's  enquiry.
    They undoubtedly established that the appellant might  have  difficulty
    on return to  Jamaica.   What  the  judge  was  required  to  consider,
    however, was whether the matters he set out at [82]-[91] gave  rise  to
    very significant obstacles to the appellant's integration on return  to
    Jamaica.

31. In SSHD v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813; [2016] 4 WLR 152, Sales LJ (as he
    then was) considered a case in which the judge in  the  Upper  Tribunal
    had noted that the use of the word 'very' showed that the threshold was
    a high one: [12].  It was in that context that Sales LJ stated that  it
    would usually be sufficient for the tribunal 'simply to  direct  itself
    in the terms that Parliament has  chosen  to  use'.   He  continued  as
    follows:

         "The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative judgment to
         be made as to whether the individual will be enough of  an  insider
         in terms of understanding how life in the  society  in  that  other
         country is carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so as to
         have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be  able  to
         operate on a day-to-day basis in  that  society  and  to  build  up
         within a reasonable time a variety of human relationships  to  give
         substance to the individual's private or family life."

32. In Parveen v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 932, the  Court  of  Appeal  came  to
    consider not only what had been said by Sales LJ (as he  then  was)  in
    Kamara, which was focused on the concept of 'integration' but also what
    had been said by the Upper Tribunal in Treebhawon [2015] UKUT 674 (IAC)
    concerning the concept of 'very significant obstacles'.  Underhill  LJ,
    with whom Gloster LJ and Asplin LJ agreed, largely disapproved what had
    been said by the Upper Tribunal and stated, instead, that

         "The task of the Secretary of State, or the Tribunal, in any  given
         case is simply to assess the obstacles to  integration  relied  on,
         whether characterised as hardship or difficulty or  anything  else,
         and to decide whether they regard them as "very significant"."

33. In AK (Kosovo) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 2038, the Court of Appeal (Flaux,
    Moylan and Leggatt LJJ) emphasised the forward-looking  nature  of  the
    exercise required, and held that the Tribunal in that case had  focused
    unduly on the appellant's remaining ties to  Kosovo,  rather  than  the
    broader question of the difficulties he would encounter on return.

34. In my judgment, the judge in this case fell into the same error as  the
    judge in AK (Kosovo).  The majority of  his  assessment  concerned  the
    ties which the appellant no  longer  had  with  Jamaica.   He  was  not
    persuaded that there was any significance in the appellant's  epilepsy,
    given the absence of evidence that he would not receive  treatment  for
    that condition.  At [89], in considering whether  the  appellant  could
    work in Jamaica he returned again to the absence of  'meaningful  links
    to Jamaica' and at [90] there was a  rather  opaque  reference  to  the
    appellant's susceptibility  to  criminal  elements.   There  was,  with
    respect to the judge, little if any consideration  of  the  appellant's
    real ability to operate on a day-to-day basis in Jamaica.

35. The judge also erred, as stated earlier, in failing to consider whether
    any  difficulties  encountered  by  the  appellant   would   be   'very
    significant'.  The concluding words of [91] "would not in  my  view  be
    sufficient to enable him to successfully integrate into  that  country"
    positively suggest that he was applying  a  lower  threshold  than  the
    elevated one required by s117C(4)(c) itself.

36. I accept Mr Knight's submission that the judge is  experienced,  and  I
    take that into account.  Mr Knight did not remind me of what  was  said
    in cases such as AH (Sudan) v SSHD [2007] UKHL 49; [2008] 1  AC  678  -
    that the FtT is an  expert  Tribunal  whose  decisions  should  not  be
    subjected to an unduly critical analysis, and that in understanding and
    applying the law in their specialist field  it  is  probable  that  the
    Tribunal will have got it right - but I have nevertheless  borne  those
    dicta firmly in mind.  I am nevertheless driven to conclude  that  this
    experienced judge, who received no real assistance  on  the  applicable
    law, fell into error as contended in ground two.  He focused unduly  on
    the appellant's ties  to  Jamaica  rather  than  undertaking  a  broad,
    forward-looking evaluation  of  his  difficulties  on  return  to  that
    country.  And  he  failed,  in  any  event,  to  consider  whether  the
    difficulties  to  integration  which  he  had  identified  were   'very
    significant'.  Whilst  the  judge  cited  the  statutory  provision  in
    question, I am unable to conclude that he approached his  task  in  the
    manner required by the authorities.

37. In the circumstances, I conclude that  the  decision  of  the  FtT  was
    marred by legal error but  only  in  relation  to  its  analysis  under
    s117C(4)(c).  That question and, if necessary, the question of  whether
    there are very  compelling  circumstances  which  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation, must be reconsidered.  There  having  been  no
    criticism of the judge's primary findings of fact, that assessment  can
    take place on the basis of the findings which the judge made  at  [81]-
    [92], together with any submissions the advocates  make  orally  or  in
    writing.  Given the limited scope of that enquiry,  I  order  that  the
    decision on the appeal shall be remade in the Upper Tribunal.  For  the
    avoidance of any doubt, the findings made in  relation  to  s117C(4)(a)
    and (b) are preserved, as are  the  findings  of  fact  made  by  Judge
    Cameron at [81]-[91] of his decision.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT involved the making of an  error  of  law  and  that
decision is set aside in part.  The decision on the appeal  will  be  remade
in the Upper Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
