                  THE PRESIDENT, MR JUSTICE McCLOSKEY


         (i)  There appears to be a practice, relatively entrenched, whereby
                  an AOS which contains a concession, with  or  without  an
                  accompanying draft consent order,  incorporates  a  claim
                  for costs, liquidated or otherwise. In  most  cases,  the
                  claim for costs has no justification.


         (ii) There may be cases, likely to be small in number, where an AOS
                  which embodies a concession on behalf of the Secretary  of
                  State, with  or  without  an  accompanying  draft  consent
                  order, justifiably and reasonably incorporates a claim for
                  costs.  In such cases, good practice dictates that the AOS
                  should state, briefly, the justification for such claim.


            iii) Where a draft consent order is tabled, both parties should
                 proactively  take  all  necessary  and  appropriate  steps
                 designed to achieve consensual resolution within a  period
                 of (at most) three weeks.


             iv) Where consensual resolution is  not  achieved  within  the
                 timescale recommended above,  this  should  operate  as  a
                 bilateral incentive to redouble efforts to do so.

              v) In every case possessing the factor of an unexecuted draft
                 consent order,  it  is  essential  to  provide  the  Upper
                 Tribunal  with  each  party's   explanation,   brief   and
                 focussed, for non-execution.   This explanation should  be
                 provided by both parties, in writing:

                    a) Within four weeks of the  date  of  the  AOS  or,  if
                       different, the date of receipt of the  draft  consent
                       order.


                    b) Where a case is listed, not  later  than  five  clear
                       working days in advance of the listing date.


                    c) In cases where there is any  material  alteration  or
                       evolution in the terms of the explanation, not  later
                       than two clear days in advance of the listing date.


             vi) It is recognised that, exceptionally, there may  be  cases
                 in which for good and sustainable reasons a consent  order
                 cannot be reasonably executed  until  a  very  late  stage
                 indeed, postdating the periods and landmarks noted  above.
                 However, the experience of the Upper Tribunal to  date  is
                 that consent orders are very frequently not  executed  and
                 presented to the Tribunal  for  approval  until  the  last
                 moment, frequently late on the day  before  the  scheduled
                 hearing and that no  good  reason  is  proffered  for  the
                 parties' failure to  do  so  at  an  earlier  stage.  This
                 practice is unacceptable.


            vii) The practice whereby executed consent  orders  materialise
                 during the period of 48 hours prior to the listing date is
                 unsatisfactory and unacceptable in the great  majority  of
                 cases.  The Upper Tribunal recognises that there may be  a
                 small  number  of  cases  where,  exceptionally,  this  is
                 unavoidable.


           viii) In matters of this kind, parties and their representatives
                 are strongly encouraged to communicate electronically with
                 the Tribunal  and,  further,  to  seek  confirmation  that
                 important  communications  and/or  attachments  have  been
                 received.



             ix) In determining issues of costs, Upper Tribunal Judges will
                 take into account the extent to which the  recommendations
                 and exhortations tabulated above have  been  observed  and
                 will   scrutinise   closely    every    explanation    and
                 justification proffered for non-compliance.

Prologue


[1]  "Rightly to be great  is  not  to  stir  without  great  argument,  but
         greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour's at the stake".

     [Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, Act IV, Scene(v)]

         The  Prince  of  Denmark,  the  great  procrastinator,  who,   with
         plentiful motive to  avenge  his  father's  murder  by  the  honour
         killing of  the  murderer,  King  Claudius,  but  had  consistently
         vacillated, was in  awe  and  admiration  of  a  Norwegian  prince.
         Fortinbras assembled a mighty army and marched on  the  kingdom  of
         Poland, the purpose being "to gain a little patch  of  ground  that
         hath in it no profit but the name".  This passage  in  one  of  the
         great Shakespearean soliloquies resonates and reverberates  in  the
         events which unfolded in the present proceedings.  The  tale  which
         follows also confirms the adage that truth is indeed stranger  than
         fiction.

The Plot

[2]  Mr Jowanski Muwonge, the Applicant in these proceedings, is  a  Ugandan
         national and the father of two Ugandan  national  children.   Being
         dissatisfied with a decision on the part of the Secretary of  State
         for the Home Department (the "Secretary of State")  to  refuse  him
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom and the  unappealable  nature
         of the decision to remove him to his country of origin, Mr  Muwonge
         brought judicial review proceedings. He did  so  expeditiously  and
         without a lawyer. He was an unrepresented litigant  from  beginning
         to end.  He began proceedings,  in  the  Administrative  Court,  in
         September 2013.   An  automatic  transfer  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
         occurred, in November 2013.

[3]  In March 2014, in a substantially delayed  Acknowledgement  of  Service
         ("AOS"), a draft Consent  Order  was  appended,  in  the  following
         terms:

         "Upon the Defendant within three months of the date of  the  sealed
             order agreeing to reconsider the Claimant's case; and

             Upon  the  Defendant   agreeing   that   if   following   such
             consideration the Defendant maintains her  decision  that  the
             Claimant should not be granted any form of leave to remain she
             will issue the Claimant with a notice to remove the  Claimant,
             thereby giving rise to a right of appeal.


             By consent, it is ordered:


              1. The Claimant do have leave to withdraw this judicial review
                 application; and


              2. The Claimant to pay the Defendant's  costs  of  filing  her
                 Acknowledgement of Service (in the sum of �90.00) based  on
                 one hour at �90.00 per hour".

        This draft consent order is linked to the following passage in  the
        AOS:


             "The Claimant has not sent a PAP letter but now indicates  with
             their grounds for judicial review that they  should  be  issued
             with a Notice of Removal/  granted  a  right  of  appeal.   The
             Defendant ...... is satisfied that her policy  applies  to  the
             Claimant and that the Claimant falls into one of the categories
             in which she has agreed to  issue  a  removal.   Therefore  the
             Defendant hereby agrees that she will within  three  months  of
             the date of the  sealed  order  consider,  or  reconsider,  any
             relevant factors, including Article 8 ECHR and  Section  55  of
             the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 (if relevant)
             ......".

     The remainder of this passage essentially  repeats  the  draft  consent
         order attached. It is appropriate to interpose at this stage  that,
         at the hearing, it was accepted on behalf of the Secretary of State
         that, contrary to the assertion in the  AOS,  a  "PAP"  letter  had
         indeed  been  transmitted  by  the  Applicant   before   initiating
         proceedings.

[4]  The AOS contains an acknowledgement  that  a  relevant  policy  of  the
         Secretary of State applies to the Applicant who, by virtue  of  his
         membership of a particular  category,  was  one  of  those  persons
         entitled to receive an appealable removal decision.  The policy  in
         question is contained in the Home Office publication "Requests  for
         Removal Decisions", the current version whereof has been  operative
         since 20 October 2014.   The earlier version of this  policy  which
         applied to the  Applicant  is  dated  13  February  2012.   As  its
         contents  make  clear,  the  publication  is  a  combination  of  a
         published government  policy  relating  to  removal  decisions  and
         guidance to case workers and decision makers. The Applicant's  case
         satisfied the first of the five additional qualifying criteria  viz
         "the refused application for leave to remain included  a  dependant
         child under 18 resident in the  UK  for  3  years  or  more".   The
         Applicant is the father of two children,  also  Ugandan  nationals.
         It was accepted at the hearing that this qualifying  criterion  was
         satisfied, as the following extract from  Ms  Overdijk's   skeleton
         argument confirms:

           "The SSHD accepts that the [Applicant] meets  the  criteria  set
           out in this policy as:


           (i)    he has made a valid but out of time application for leave
                    to remain that has been refused;


           (ii)    he  has  not  received  a  removal  decision  when   the
                    application for leave was refused;


           (iii)  he has failed to leave the UK voluntarily; and


           (iv)   he has requested in a PAP, or letter before action,  that
                    a removal decision is made"

         This confirmed the acceptance already enshrined in the AOS.

[5]  During the intervening seven months, following service of the AOS,  the
         case progressed and had to be processed by a variety of actors - Mr
         Muwonge, the Secretary of State's legal team,  the  Upper  Tribunal
         administration and an Upper Tribunal Judge who, in July 2014,  made
         an order containing the following ingredients:

        (a)  the permission application was adjourned to be listed  for  an
                 oral inter-partes hearing,  with  a  time  estimate  of  30
                 minutes.

        (b)  the Applicant was  required  to  lodge  and  file  a  skeleton
                 argument at least seven days in advance of the hearing.

        (c)  the Respondent was required to do likewise at least three days
                 before the hearing.


         There was no further pre-hearing order.


         [6]  In the course of the same period, some two months  before  the
                 listing, an exchange of correspondence between  Mr  Muwonge
                 and the Treasury Solicitor's  Department  established  that
                 the former had two enduring concerns.   First,  he  queried
                 why, given the extensive elapse of time which had  occurred
                 already, the reconsideration of the impugned decision would
                 be delayed for a further period of three  months.   Second,
                 he  questioned  why,  in  the   circumstances   which   had
                 materialised, he should have to pay the Secretary of  State
                 legal costs of �90.00. In doing so  he,  pertinently,  drew
                 attention to the decision of the Court of  Appeal  in  M  v
                 Croydon [2012] EWCA Civ 595.  He contended, in terms,  that
                 by reason of the AOS and draft consent order  he  had  been
                 wholly  successful  and,  therefore,  should  not  have  to
                 account for any of the  Respondent's  costs.   Regrettably,
                 this letter received no response.  Thus  the  Secretary  of
                 State was maintaining the stance adopted  in  the  AOS  and
                 draft order, as reiterated in an earlier  letter  dated  30
                 July 2014 which had enclosed a further copy  of  the  draft
                 consent order and sternly warned:

     "Should you choose not to agree to withdraw  the  proceedings,  instead
             allowing the matter to proceed to a permission hearing  ......
             then the Secretary of State will seek to recover her costs  at
             the hearing".

     The Applicant rejoined, in the terms summarised above.   His  carefully
         and thoughtfully composed letter was either not  considered  worthy
         of a response or was overlooked.

[7]   Seven  months  following  service  of  the  AOS,   their   differences
         unresolved, these two litigants, veritable latter day  incarnations
         of the biblical figures David and Goliath, presented themselves  to
         the Upper Tribunal.  Theirs was one of nine cases initially  listed
         for hearing on the date in question, 10 October 2014. It was listed
         as a permission application which had been adjourned into Court  by
         a Judge following consideration of the papers.

     The Hearing

[8]  Thereafter, the case was given a listing and Counsel was instructed  to
         represent the Secretary of  State.   Having  regard  to  the  Upper
         Tribunal's order, skeleton arguments from both parties  had  to  be
         prepared and these were duly  exchanged  and  lodged.  The  hearing
         ensued, on  10  October  2014.   Mr  Muwonge  attended  in  person,
         accompanied by a "McKenzie" friend.  In attendance on behalf of the
         Secretary of State were solicitor and Counsel, Ms Overdijk.

[9]  On any rational analysis, Mr Muwonge could not have  expected  that  he
         would,  literally,  have  to  pay  a  price  for   exercising   his
         constitutional right of access to a court and securing a  surrender
         by the Secretary of State.  Nor could he have anticipated incurring
         the wrath and might of the State to the extent that he  was  driven
         into  court  in  order  to  secure  judicial  adjudication  of  the
         Secretary of State's entitlement to levy the  financial  charge  in
         question.  By the date  of  judicial  adjudication,  the  plot  had
         thickened with a further twist.  In consequence of the Secretary of
         State's engagement of Counsel, the price had  risen  steeply,  from
         �90.00 to �600.00,  to  reflect  the  cost  of  Counsel's  skeleton
         argument and attendance. At the hearing, the Tribunal was requested
         on behalf of the Secretary of State to make an order dismissing  Mr
         Muwonge's application for judicial review and ordering that he  pay
         the Secretary of State's legal costs of �610.00.  We  observe  that
         an order in these terms would neither mention nor annex the AOS  or
         its accompanying draft consent order. It would have left Mr Muwonge
         exposed and unprotected.

[10] Having considered the representations of both parties, we were able  to
         pronounce our decision and make an immediate order disposing of the
         proceedings.  This took the  form  of  the  Tribunal  approving   a
         revised  version   of   the   draft   consent   order   which   the
         Acknowledgement of Service had attached.  The Tribunal  proactively
         initiated, and completed, the process of developing  the  Secretary
         of State's draft order in two modest  respects,  having  considered
         the representations of both parties.  In doing so, it exercised its
         powers under Rules 17 and  39  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
         Tribunal) Rules 2008 and gave the fullest effect  possible  to  the
         overriding  objective,  enshrined  in  rule  2.  The   two   modest
         modifications of the Secretary of State's draft order consisted  of
         reducing to  four  weeks  from  three  months  the  reconsideration
         period, time to run from the date of  the  hearing  and,  secondly,
         making no order as to costs inter-partes.

Commentary

[11] To summarise, Mr Muwonge, having had  the  courage  and  enterprise  to
        bring  legal  proceedings,  unrepresented  and   bereft  of   legal
        training or qualifications, exposed an  unlawful  decision  by  the
        Secretary of State impacting adversely on him.  The  illegality  of
        the impugned decision consisted of a failure by  the  Secretary  of
        State to make an appealable removal decision in accordance with the
        policy rehearsed above.  We consider  this  analysis  unassailable.
        Moreover, the illegality of the decision was formally  acknowledged
        on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State   in   the   AOS.    This
        acknowledgement was made in substance  by  a  commitment  that  the
        unlawful decision would be  voluntarily  rescinded  and,  following
        reconsideration, made afresh, coupled with an undertaking to make a
        new, appealable decision in the event  of  the  earlier  one  being
        unchanged. We consider the only tenable  analysis  to  be  that  Mr
        Muwonge was, in substance, the victor.

 [12]    How this case reached the stage of  a  substantive  listing  defies
         both logic and reason. There  was  a  concession  in  Secretary  of
         State's AOS. We consider that the effect  of  this  concession  was
         that the  Applicant's  act  of  initiating  proceedings  was  fully
         vindicated. Notwithstanding Ms Overdijk's courageous submission  to
         the contrary, no other  analysis,  sensibly  or  realistically,  is
         possible. Properly analysed, the terms of the concession were  that
         having regard to her  policy  the  Secretary  of  State  had  acted
         unlawfully in making an unappealable decision to refuse  leave  for
         Mr Muwonge to remain in the United  Kingdom.   The  effect  of  her
         policy was that the Secretary of State  was,  rather,  required  to
         make an  appealable  decision.  She  failed  to  do  so  and  acted
         unlawfully in  consequence.  She  was  now  proposing  a  means  of
         rectification and atonement.

[13] Following upon the lodgement of  the  overdue  AOS,  the  Secretary  of
         State  maintained  the  stance  expressed  therein   and   in   the
         accompanying draft order.  This resulted in a steadfast refusal  to
         take  the  glaringly  obvious  step  of  withdrawing  the   totally
         unjustified demand that  in  consideration  of  the  commitment  to
         reconsider the impugned decision and the remainder of  the  package
         proposed, the Applicant pay her �90.00.  This  has  resulted  in  a
         quite  extraordinary state of affairs, as outlined above.

[14] As appears from [5] above, the outcome of the permission hearing was  a
         revised consent order, in the terms indicated.  We make clear  that
         if the revised consent order had not materialised we would not have
         acceded to the  Secretary  of  State's  application  for  an  order
         dismissing  Mr  Muwonge's  application  for  permission.   If   the
         mechanism of a  revised  consent  order  had  not  eventuated,  for
         whatever reason, our order, reflecting the particular circumstances
         of this case, would have been a grant of permission  to  apply  for
         judicial review, with accompanying directions designed to ensure  a
         swift final disposal.  The  second  element  of  the  Secretary  of
         State's application  to  the  Tribunal  was,  as  noted  above,  an
         application for costs  against  the  Applicant.  We  consider  this
         application for costs utterly hopeless.  Some might describe it  as
         audacious.  We are unable to conceive of a less  meritorious  claim
         for costs.  If Mr Muwonge had been legally represented,  we  would,
         without hesitation, have ordered the Secretary of State to pay  his
         legal costs and outlays in full.  We would also have given  serious
         consideration to ordering that such costs be paid on  an  indemnity
         basis.

[15] We received no argument on the issue of whether an order  can  be  made
         requiring a  Respondent  to  pay  the  costs  of  an  unrepresented
         applicant in judicial review proceedings.  We would, however,  draw
         attention to the decision of the Northern  Ireland  High  Court  in
         Morrow - v - Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police [2011] NIQB 6 in
         which, having referred to the relevant local rules and the  English
         CPR48.6, the Court  stated:

             "It would be unsurprising if a majority of  practitioners  and
             courts have little or no familiarity with [this rule].   There
             may well be a perception abroad that personal litigants do not
             incur - and, therefore, are not entitled to  recover  -  legal
             costs,  for  the  simple  reason  that  they  have  no   legal
             representation.  They elect, rather, to represent  themselves.
             If such perception exists, it is incorrect .....

             The English rule is the same: see CPR48.6(2) above.   In  Cook
             on Costs 2010, it  is  noted  that  a  personal  litigant  can
             recover, for example, the  cost  arising  out  of  engaging  a
             properly instructed expert witness (see paragraph  38.7).   It
             may also be possible to recover the costs of solicitors and/or
             Counsel properly instructed at an earlier stage."

         This judgment also notes the distinction between disbursements  and
         a solicitor's professional fees.  We confine ourselves  to  drawing
         attention to this issue and express no concluded view thereon.

[16] Miss Overdijk is entirely blameless in this remarkable and  regrettable
         saga.  It was apparent to us that she was instructed only  recently
         and she has confirmed this.  We have derived  much  assistance  not
         only from her skeleton  argument  but  also  from  her  candid  and
         professionally correct engagement with the court.

Guidance

[17] Upon the first anniversary of  the  landmark  extension  of  the  Upper
         Tribunal's jurisdiction to incorporate the  vast  majority  of  all
         immigration and asylum judicial reviews previously within the remit
         of the Administrative Court, it is timely to take  stock.   In  our
         newly  conferred  judicial  review  jurisdiction,  Judges  of  this
         Tribunal  have  been  alert  to  detect  recurring   unsatisfactory
         practices and trends.  Some of these are typified  in  the  present
         case.  We take this opportunity to promulgate the following general
         guidance:

         (i)  There appears to be a practice, relatively entrenched, whereby
                  an AOS which contains a concession, with  or  without  an
                  accompanying draft consent order,  incorporates  a  claim
                  for costs, liquidated or otherwise. This occurs typically
                  in cases of the present kind.  Other cases  in  which  it
                  commonly  occurs  are  those  in  which  a   failure   to
                  acknowledge, or consider, a relevant child  or  children,
                  in contravention of section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizens
                  and Immigration Act 2009, is conceded. In most cases, the
                  claim for costs has  no  justification.   The  consistent
                  experience  of  this  Tribunal  is  that  this   practice
                  obstructs and delays and, sometimes, prevents  consensual
                  resolution of the parties' differences. It  promotes  the
                  so-called unholy trinity of elevated  costs,  unnecessary
                  complexity and avoidable delay.   Simultaneously,  it  is
                  antithetical to the overriding objective. I consider this
                  a highly  unsatisfactory  practice  and  urge  its  swift
                  reconsideration and abandonment.


         (ii) There may be cases, likely to be small in number, where an AOS
                  which embodies a concession on behalf of the Secretary  of
                  State, with  or  without  an  accompanying  draft  consent
                  order, justifiably and reasonably incorporates a claim for
                  costs.  In such cases, good practice dictates that the AOS
                  should state, briefly, the justification for such claim.


            iii) The practice, also well entrenched, whereby draft  consent
                 orders fester and  gather  dust  in  the  offices  of  the
                 parties and their representatives  is  to  be  deprecated.
                 Where a draft consent order is tabled, both parties should
                 proactively  take  all  necessary  and  appropriate  steps
                 designed to achieve consensual resolution within a  period
                 of  three  weeks.  This  period  will,  of  necessity,  be
                 considerably shorter in certain contexts.


             iv) Where consensual resolution is  not  achieved  within  the
                 timescale recommended above,  this  should  operate  as  a
                 bilateral incentive to redouble efforts to do so.

              v) In every case possessing the factor of an unexecuted draft
                 consent order,  it  is  essential  to  provide  the  Upper
                 Tribunal  with  each  party's   explanation,   brief   and
                 focussed, for non-execution.   This explanation should  be
                 provided by both parties, in writing:

                    a) Within four weeks of the  date  of  the  AOS  or,  if
                       different, the date of receipt of the  draft  consent
                       order.


                    b) Where a case is listed, not  later  than  five  clear
                       working days in advance of the listing date.


                    c) In cases where there is any  material  alteration  or
                       evolution in the terms of the explanation, not  later
                       than two clear days in advance of the listing date.


             vi) It is recognised that, exceptionally, there may  be  cases
                 in which for good and sustainable reasons a consent  order
                 cannot be reasonably executed  until  a  very  late  stage
                 indeed, postdating the periods and landmarks noted  above.
                 However, the experience of the Upper Tribunal to  date  is
                 that consent orders are very frequently not  executed  and
                 presented to the Tribunal  for  approval  until  the  last
                 moment, frequently late on the day  before  the  scheduled
                 hearing and that no  good  reason  is  proffered  for  the
                 parties' failure to  do  so  at  an  earlier  stage.  This
                 practice is unacceptable.


            vii) The practice whereby executed consent  orders  materialise
                 during the period of 48 hours prior to the listing date is
                 unsatisfactory and unacceptable in the great  majority  of
                 cases.  The Upper Tribunal recognises that there may be  a
                 small  number  of  cases  where,  exceptionally,  this  is
                 unavoidable.  In all such cases, it is essential that  the
                 communication  of  the  executed  consent  order  to   the
                 Tribunal incorporate a brief explanation  of  the  timing.
                 Parties must realise henceforth that,  almost  invariably,
                 the increasingly beleaguered and  threatened  resource  of
                 judicial preparation time, in advance of a judicial review
                 list typically  containing  nine  cases,  will  have  been
                 irrevocably expended prior to the beginning of the 48 hour
                 period immediately preceding the listing date.


           viii) In matters of this kind, parties and their representatives
                 are strongly encouraged to communicate electronically with
                 the Tribunal  and,  further,  to  seek  confirmation  that
                 important  communications  and/or  attachments  have  been
                 received.  Additionally, where the parties  are  aware  of
                 the identity of the designated Judge (for example,  in  an
                 adjourned or part heard  case),  communications  with  the
                 Tribunal must highlight this.

             ix) In determining issues of costs, Upper Tribunal Judges will
                 take into account the extent to which the  recommendations
                 and exhortations tabulated above have  been  observed  and
                 will   scrutinise   closely    every    explanation    and
                 justification proffered for non-compliance.

[18] We are confident that adherence to the practices described  above  will
         promote the values of efficiency, expedition and  reducing  expense
         and will, thereby, be of utility to litigants and practitioners.

[19] Practitioners will be familiar with the Administrative  Court  Guidance
         entitled   "How  the  Parties  should   assist   the   Court   when
         Applications for Costs are made following Settlement of Claims  for
         Judicial Review", promulgated in December 2013  and  applicable  to
         all consent orders submitted for approval by  the  Court  after  13
         January 2014.  We endorse the exhortation in [4]  that  "efficiency
         and co-operation from the parties" are required in every case.   We
         further endorse the following three paragraphs:

         "[5] The onus lies on the  parties  to  reach  agreement  on  costs
                  wherever possible and in advance of asking  the  Court  to
                  resolve the issues, in order  to  support  the  overriding
                  objective and  ensure  that  sufficient  use  is  made  of
                  judicial time.  See M - v - Croydon Borough Council [2012]
                  EWCA Civ 595, [75] - [77].


         [6]  The parties should not make submissions to the Court on  costs
                  following a compromise of the proceedings without  seeking
                  to  agree  the  allocation  of  costs   through   reasoned
                  negotiation, applying these  principles,  mindful  of  the
                  overriding objective in the CPR and the  amount  of  costs
                  actually  at  stake.   This  should  give  them  a   clear
                  understanding of the basis upon which they have failed  to
                  reach agreement, so as to focus their submissions  to  the
                  Court on the points in dispute.


         [7]  Liability for costs between the parties  will  depend  on  the
                  specific facts in each case but the principles are set out
                  in M - v - Croydon [59] - [63]."

[20] A proliferation of unresolved  costs  disputes  has  the  potential  to
         generate a highly undesirable cottage industry.  This  furthers  no
         identifiable interest  of  any  kind.  Notwithstanding,  the  Upper
         Tribunal will, of course, adjudicate  on  costs  disputes  -  which
         should, in practice, be rare - in those cases where the principles,
         practices and standards outlined above,  conscientiously  observed,
         have failed to achieve consensual resolution.

Epilogue

[21] The Prince of Denmark drew inspiration from the event unfolding  before
         his fascinated gaze.  It was a cause of admiration approaching awe.
         At this point, however, the comparison with  this  litigation  ends
         abruptly. There is a world of difference between the cabbage  patch
         in 13th century Poland and the spiralling  events  in  the  present
         case. There is nothing to admire in  the  tale  told  above.  Every
         battle generates causalities.  Mr Muwonge undoubtedly attracts this
         appellation, given the delays,  frustration  and  wasted  resources
         which he  has  suffered  notwithstanding  the  early  surrender  he
         secured, to no practical avail and his ultimate success.   However,
         and  sadly,  the  major  casualties  in  this  litigation  are  the
         overriding objective, which was truly bruised and battered and  the
         principle of proportionality, which has emerged wilting and shaken,
         bloodied but unbowed.  Lessons must be learned.

Order

[22] We reject  the  Secretary  of  State's  application  for  an  order  to
         dismiss.  We conclude that the fair, just and  reasonable  disposal
         of these proceedings is to approve the draft  consent  order,  duly
         revised so as to incorporate the following terms:

         (i)  The Secretary of State  hereby  rescinds  the  decision  under
                 challenge and will, within four weeks of 10  October  2014,
                 make a fresh decision.  In the event of  the  Secretary  of
                 State maintaining the impugned decision, the Applicant will
                 be served with removal  directions,  thereby  generating  a
                 right of appeal.


         (ii) There is no order as to costs inter - partes.


         (iii)    Liberty to apply, in writing and on notice  to  the  other
                  party.
