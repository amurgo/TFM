Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS
Details of the Appellant
   1. The Appellant is a national  of  Jamaica  who  was  born  on  the  2nd
      November 1987.

Background

   2. On the 9th July 2015, the Appellant's appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
      against the decision of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Obhi which had  been
      promulgated on the 19th September 2014 was heard by myself  and  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Kopieczek. In our decision dated the 12th July 2015, we
      decided that the  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Obhi  did
      contain material errors of law and was set-aside and that the decision
      should be remade by the Upper Tribunal  at  a  hearing  before  either
      myself or Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek.


   3. As was stated in our previous decision, the Appellant  initially  came
      to the United Kingdom on the 17th December 2001 as a dependent of  her
      mother. On the 8th May 2003 the  Appellant  was  a  dependent  on  her
      mother's application for further to Leave to Remain as a student which
      was granted until the 10th October 2003. On the 7th October  2003  the
      Appellant made an application  as  a  dependent  child  (on  a  legacy
      application basis) which  was  refused  on  the  11th  December  2003.
      Thereafter, on the 10th September  2012  the  Appellant  submitted  an
      application for a Derivative Residence card on the basis that  she  is
      the primary carer of a British citizen who is resident in  the  United
      Kingdom. That application was refused by the Respondent  on  the  29th
      November 2013.



   4. The appeal against that decision was originally  heard  by  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Obhi on the 4th September 2013 with her decision  being
      promulgated on the 19th September 2014.



   5. The matter then came before myself and Upper Tribunal Judge  Kopieczek
      on the 9th July 2015 and in our decision dated  the  12th  July  2015,
      although we set the decision of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Obhi  aside,
      a concession was made before the Upper Tribunal by Mr Mills acting  on
      behalf of the Respondent that the Appellant is Miss C's primary carer,
      such that it was appropriate for us to remake the  other  findings  in
      respect of the other issues in the case. It was on that basis that the
      appeal came before me on the 9th September 2015.


   6. Given the concession made by Mr Mills on the previous occasion, it was
      agreed with the parties that the primary issue for me to determine was
      whether or not Miss C, as the relevant British citizen would be unable
      to reside in the UK or in another EEA state,  if  the  Appellant,  her
      primary carer, were required to leave for the purposes  of  Regulation
      15 A (4A) (c) of  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006.  Mr  Yeo
      further wished to argue that Article 8 was engaged in  this  case  and
      sought to argue that the case of Amirteymour and Others (EEA  Appeals;
      Human Rights) [2015] UKUT 00466 (IAC), was wrongly  decided  and  that
      there was a deemed human rights claim  such  as  to  mean  that  human
      rights were judiciable before the Tribunal. He  argued  that  although
      the decision was extremely influential, it was not binding upon me and
      that as there was a deemed human rights claim,  Article  8  should  be
      considered.



   7. However, as was stated in the previous decision on  myself  and  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Kopieczek, given that the Appellant had applied  for  a
      Derivative Residence card, that issue should be determined first,  and
      it is only if the Appellant is unsuccessful in respect of  that  issue
      that it is only then necessary to consider whether or not Article 8 is
      in fact engaged. The fact that she might gain status as  a  result  of
      finding on the  basis  of  Article  8  where  she  would  not  on  her
      application for a Derivative  Residence  card,  as  previously  argued
      before us, does not mean that consideration of  the  Article  8  issue
      takes precedence. The Appellant  had  applied  on  the  basis  of  the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 and had not actually applied on the
      basis of Article 8.


   8. I first heard oral evidence in this case from the Appellant to confirm
      that the contents of her witness statement dated the 24th August  2015
      had been signed by herself and were true and accurate and she  adopted
      the same as her evidence in chief.


   9. In cross examination the Appellant told me that Miss  C's  father  had
      last seen her on the day before her birthday on the  26th  April  2015
      and had taken her to McDonald's. She told me that since then  she  had
      spoken to Miss C's father on an occasion at the end of June when  Miss
      C was ill and in hospital because of  asthma,  but  that  he  did  not
      attend at the hospital. She was asked whether or not  the  father  had
      produced any further written statements and the Appellant told me that
      he did not want to get involved and that he said that  he  was  to  be
      kept out of it and did not want, and had no intention of becoming Miss
      C's full-time dad.  The  Appellant  was  asked  why  it  was  in  such
      circumstances that he had written a letter back in August 2012  saying
      that his relationship with his daughter was very important to him  and
      that he was happy for the relevant Department to contact him, and  the
      Appellant said that he had only wanted to be with her  and  that  when
      their relationship ended, there was a  downturn  in  the  interest  he
      showed their daughter. She told me that she was not sure as to whether
      or not he had since spoken to  his  wife  about  the  existence  of  a
      daughter but that he did want to keep  their  daughter's  existence  a
      secret. She told me that since  September  2014  her  aunt  no  longer
      supported her and that she was supported by children's  services.  She
      said the reason for that was that her aunt's own  daughter  had  split
      from  her  husband  and  she  had  taken  in  her  daughter  and   two
      grandchildren. She said that her sister had now acquired  some  status
      in the UK and had been given permission to stay for 2 � years, but she
      was not given indefinite Leave to Remain. Her  mother  still  had  not
      been given any status in the UK. She said that  her  sister  lived  80
      miles away  in  Wolverhampton.  Her  sister  did  not  help  with  the
      Appellant's finances. The Appellant told me that  her  solicitors  had
      not told her to get any letters of support from her sister  or  mother
      in the UK. There was no re-examination


  10. In answer my questions in clarification the Appellant told me that her
      sister had her own child who was 1 year old and that Miss  C  did  see
      her aunt about once a fortnight. There were no questions  arising  out
      of my questions

Submissions

  11.  In  her  closing  submissions  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent,  Miss
      Brocklesby-Weller argued that in respect of the issue as to whether or
      not the relevant British citizen child would be unable  to  reside  in
      the UK or another EEA state if the Appellant were required  to  leave,
      that it was a high threshold  that  had  not  been  made  out  in  the
      evidence presented. She argued that there was little evidence to  show
      that the family set up had changed in terms  of  support  being  given
      financially by the aunt and that the timing of that  financial  change
      was convenient, given that it had occurred in September 2014,  at  the
      time of the original appeal hearing.  She  argued  that  although  the
      other members of the  family,  including  the  great  aunt  and  great
      uncles, did not have any contact  or  residence  orders,  such  orders
      could be applied for after the Appellant had left the country, if Miss
      C were to remain.


  12. She argued that Miss C's father did have  parental  responsibility  as
      his name was on the birth certificate and that Miss  C  would  not  be
      compelled to leave and that it would be a matter of  choice  that  she
      would be taken by her mother rather than being a matter of compulsion.
      She argued that we only had the Appellant's  oral  evidence  regarding
      the contact or lack of contact from the Appellant's father,  but  that
      she asked me to bear in mind that the Appellant had what she described
      as a "very poor" immigration history as she had overstayed since 2003.





  13. Miss Brocklesby-Weller argued that Miss C's  father  had  not  totally
      abandoned the child and was still willing to engage in a  relationship
      with his child and had been informed of Miss C's illness and had  seen
      her on the day before her birthday and that it was surprising that  we
      had not got further information from the Appellant's father  or  heard
      from him, given that he had previously been willing to cooperate.  She
      argued that it was speculation as to whether or not  Miss  C's  father
      had told his wife about the relationship and the existence of  Miss  C
      and that he had been willing to put his name on the birth certificate.


  14. In respect of Article 8, Ms Brocklesby-Weller asked me to  follow  the
      Upper Tribunal decision of the President  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Mr
      Justice McCloskey,  the  Vice-President  of  the  Tribunal  and  Upper
      Tribunal Judge Rintoul in the case of Aminteymour and argued  that  it
      was always open to the Appellant to make an Article 8  application  on
      the basis that she was the mother of a British national child,  should
      she wish to do so. She argued that  there  had  been  no  section  120
      notice in the present case  and  that  Article  8  was  therefore  not
      engaged as a result of the refusal to  issue  a  Derivative  Residence
      card under the immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.



  15. In his closing submissions on behalf the Appellant, Mr Yeo asked me to
      accept the evidence of the Appellant. He argued that it was unfair  to
      say that the Appellant had a very poor immigration history, as she had
      been brought to the UK as a child and that she had no  choice  in  the
      matter and although she had thereafter overstayed, it  was  unfair  to
      say she had a poor immigration history. He argued that Miss C's father
      had no real role in her life and that the Appellant had  been  upfront
      and honest regarding the limited contact that he had. He  argued  that
      the Home Office had been invited to contact him, in a  sensitive  way,
      but that they have not done so and that someone  who  had  shown  very
      little interest in wanting to care for Miss  C  should  not  be  in  a
      position to be forced to do so.



  16. Mr Yeo relied upon the Court of Appeal case of  Harrison  (Jamaica)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA  Civ  1736,  in
      which Lord Justice Elias  at  [67]  had  stated  that  "the  right  of
      residence is a right to reside in the territory of the EU. It is not a
      right to any particular quality of life or to any particular  standard
      of living. Accordingly, there is no impediment to exercising the right
      to reside, if residence remains possible as  a  matter  of  substance,
      albeit the quality of life is diminished".  However, at paragraph  67,
      Lord justice Elias went on to state that "of  course,  to  the  extent
      that the quality of life will be seriously impaired by  excluding  the
      non-EU national, that is likely in practice to infringe the  right  of
      residence itself because it will effectively compel the EU citizen  to
      give up residence and travel with the non-EU national. But in  such  a
      case the Zambrano doctrine would apply and  the  EU  citizen's  rights
      would have to be protected".



  17.  He argued that therefore if as a matter of reality Miss  C  would  be
      compelled to leave then Regulation 15 A (4A) (c) would  be  satisfied.
      He argued that a very young child should not  be  separated  from  her
      primary and in reality only carer. He argued that  if  the  father  of
      Miss C had been in a position where he had overnight contact and there
      had been a high degree of contact, then the  position  may  have  been
      different, but bare contact with occasional trips  to  McDonald's  was
      not enough.


  18. He further argued that as there was a deemed human rights claim  as  a
      result of the decision reached, human rights  were  engaged  and  were
      judicial before the Tribunal and that therefore I  should  not  follow
      the recent Upper Tribunal decision in Aminteymour.



  19. Both Miss Brocklesby-Weller and Mr Yeo agreed that given the errors of
      law found in First-Tier Tribunal Judge Obhi's decision  regarding  her
      assessment as to who was the primary carer of Miss C and her  confused
      findings regarding the role played by Miss C's  father,  that  it  was
      appropriate for me to make completely fresh findings on  the  role  of
      Miss C's father and the level of contact that he had and as to whether
      or not in such circumstances the relevant British citizen child Miss C
      would be unable to reside in the UK or in another  EEA  state  if  the
      Appellant were required to leave.

My Findings on Credibility and Fact

  20. Although the Appellant made no attempts between  the  refusal  of  her
      application as a dependent child on a legacy application based on  the
      11th December 2003 to regularise her position in the UK until the 10th
      September 2012, and therefore for many years had been an  over-stayer,
      which I have clearly borne in mind as being a factor which does  count
      against her credibility, I nevertheless did find the Appellant  to  be
      an honest and reliable witness in respect of the relationship that she
      had with Miss C's father and the level of contact  that  he  has  with
      Miss C.


  21. The Appellant is the  primary  carer  for  Miss  C,  as  was  properly
      conceded by Mr  Mills  at  the  previous  hearing  on  behalf  of  the
      Respondent. I further find that Miss C is a  British  citizen  who  is
      residing  in  the  United  Kingdom,  presently  with  her  mother  the
      Appellant. The only issue that therefore  requires  determination  for
      the purposes as to whether or not the  Appellant  in  fact  meets  the
      criteria for a Derivative Right of Residence under Regulation 15A (4A)
      of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, is as to whether or not the
      relevant British citizen would be  unable  to  reside  in  the  UK  or
      another EEA state if P were required to leave, in other words  whether
      or not Miss C would be unable to reside in the UK or  in  another  EEA
      state if the Appellant were required to leave.



  22. I find that the Appellant has  given  consistent  evidence  throughout
      regarding the limited role that Miss C's father has played in her life
      and that this is not a case where she has simply said that she has had
      no contact with him whatsoever since Miss C's birth, but  I  find  has
      been open and honest regarding the very limited  involvement  of  Miss
      C's father in her life. I accept and find as a fact having  considered
      the Appellant's new statement dated the 24th August 2015, that she did
      meet Miss C's father back in June  2010  and  that  it  was  a  casual
      relationship, but that when  she  initially  mentioned  that  she  had
      fallen pregnant to the father, his initial response was to ask whether
      or not she was sure that he was the father and to say that she  should
      have an abortion, but that she continued with the pregnancy.



  23.  I also accept and find as a fact having  considered  the  Appellant's
      evidence  including  the  initial  statement  provided  by  her,  oral
      evidence and her latest witness statement  that  Miss  C's  father  is
      married and does have his own disabled child and that  his  wife  does
      not know about the affair that he had with the  Appellant  or  that  a
      child resulted there from. I  accept  the  explanation  given  by  the
      Appellant as to why the  father's  name  appears  on  Miss  C's  birth
      certificate, namely that she did not know who her own father  was  and
      did not want the same to happen to her daughter, and that he agreed to
      put his name on the birth certificate for that reason, rather than  as
      a result of a full acceptance of his role as Miss C's father. Although
      this would give him parental responsibility,  as  of  right,  that  is
      entirely different from him actually wanting  to  necessarily  play  a
      full role in Miss C's life or being a primary  carer  or  being  in  a
      position to accommodate or raise Miss C. The reasons why  he  had  his
      name put on the birth certificate  I  accept  were  for  very  limited
      reasons in that he was asked to do so by the Appellant,  so  that  the
      child would know who her father was, rather than for any other reason.


  24. I also do bear in mind the letter from Miss C's father, Mr B dated the
      28th August 2012  in  which  he  says  that  the  Appellant  has  full
      responsibility for their daughter as his career is very demanding  and
      that he works long hours and only gets to see and spend time with Miss
      C on some weekends or whenever he could. He further stated within that
      letter that his career is not the only obstacle  preventing  him  from
      being with and having  his  daughter  on  a  regular  basis  and  that
      although his relationship with his daughter is very important he is  a
      married man which prevents him from caring  for  her  on  a  full-time
      basis. He says it would be a strain on his marriage to  bring  Miss  C
      into the marital home as his wife is unaware of  her  existence.  That
      letter is entirely consistent with the evidence given by the Appellant
      regarding his limited contact and the reasons therefore.



  25.  Further, I accept having heard from her  and  having  considered  her
      latest statement, that for a short while after the birth  of  Miss  C,
      the Appellant's relationship with Mr B did get better  and  that  they
      did start their relationship again, but it ended when Miss C was about
      8 months old when the Appellant realised that Mr B was only showing up
      because he wanted the Appellant sexually and that Mr B  did  not  take
      the breakup very well, leading to the downturn in contact that he  has
      had with her. I accept that Mr B does not financially support  Miss  C
      having heard from the Appellant in this regard and that Mr  B  has  in
      effect only seen his daughter at the time of her last two birthdays. I
      found the Appellant's evidence that Mr B did not even turn up  at  the
      hospital when she phoned him to say that Miss C was  in  hospital  ill
      with asthma, to be compelling and to have the ring of truth about  it.
      I find that the Appellant has not exaggerated the  limited  role  that
      Miss C's father has had, and has given an honest and truthful  account
      regarding  the  limited  contact  she  has  had,  which  is   entirely
      consistent with the fact that he is married and his wife does not know
      of Miss C's existence.


  26. In such circumstances, given that Mr B does work long  hours  and  his
      wife does not know about the existence of Miss C and that Miss  C  was
      born following an affair that Mr B had, although I  do  bear  in  mind
      that Mr B does have parental responsibility for his daughter, I do not
      accept that he is in a position  to  actually  be  able  to  raise  or
      accommodate Miss C on a long-term basis in the United Kingdom. He  has
      shown no real interest in his daughter and no desire or willingness to
      damage his marriage by telling his  wife  about  the  existence  of  a
      daughter born as a result of an affair outside of wedlock. There is no
      evidence whatsoever of him being willing to undertake such a role, and
      the letter that he has written indicates that he is not prepared to do
      so.



  27. Nor do I consider that there are any other relatives of the  Appellant
      who would in reality be able to accommodate and raise Miss C on a long-
      term basis. The Appellant's own mother still does not have any  status
      in the UK, and although the Appellant's sister now has limited  status
      in the UK, she I accept having heard from the Appellant does have  her
      own child who is  one-year-old,  and  would  therefore  not  be  in  a
      position to raise Miss C  on  a  long-term  basis.  Nor  would  it  be
      appropriate for Miss C to live with great uncles and great aunts,  who
      she does not really  know,  which  I  accept  having  heard  from  the
      Appellant in this regard. It  is  further  highly  relevant  that  the
      Appellant's daughter was only born on  the  27th  April  2012  and  is
      therefore now just 3 years  old.  It  is  clearly  in  Miss  C's  best
      interests, to remain with her mother given her very young age,  rather
      than being placed with other relatives who she barely knows. I do bear
      in mind that the duty to  safeguard  the  welfare  of  children  under
      Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  is  a
      primary consideration, rather than a paramount consideration, but  the
      welfare of a 3-year-old child who has only had the  Appellant  as  her
      primary carer throughout her life, is a very important factor in  this
      particular case.


  28. I further do bear in mind the comments of Lady Hale  at  [32]  in  the
      case of ZH (Tanzania) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2011] UKSC 4 of the intrinsic importance of British  citizenship  and
      that it should not be played down and that  British  citizen  children
      have rights which they will not be able to exercise if  they  move  to
      another country and that they lose the advantages of  growing  up  and
      being educated in their own country and in  their  own  culture  which
      they will have lost when they come back as adults.



  29. I further bear in mind specifically the comments of Lord Justice Elias
      in the case of Harrison (Jamaica) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
      Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1736,  that  at  [67]  that  the  right  of
      residence is a right to reside in the territory of the EU and is not a
      right to any particular quality of life or to any particular  standard
      of living and that accordingly there is no  impediment  to  exercising
      the right to reside if residence  remains  possible  as  a  matter  of
      substance, albeit the quality of life is diminished. However, he  went
      on to state that "of  course,  to  the  extent  that  the  quality  or
      standard of life will be seriously impaired by  excluding  the  non-EU
      national, that  is  likely  in  practice  to  infringe  the  right  of
      residence itself because it will effectively compel the EU citizen  to
      give up residence and travel with the non-EU  national.  But  in  such
      case the Zambrano doctrine would apply and  the  EU  citizen's  rights
      would  have  to  be  protected  (save  for  the   possibility   of   a
      proportionate deprivation of rights). Accordingly, to the extent  that
      the  focus  is  on  protecting  the  substance  of  the  right,   that
      formulation of the principle already provides protection from  certain
      interferences with the enjoyment of that right".


  30. I consider that and find as a fact that in this case, Miss C's quality
      and standard of life would be seriously impaired by the  exclusion  of
      the Appellant, such that it would be in practice  likely  to  infringe
      the right of residence itself, in that Miss C cannot in  my  judgement
      be left in the care of her father who is unwilling to look  after  her
      or in the care of the Appellant's sister or other relatives in the  UK
      for the reasons stated above, such that in effect Miss H's removal  to
      Jamaica would compel Miss C to give up  her  right  of  residence  and
      travel with her mother back to Jamaica. I cannot foresee that  if  the
      Appellant is removed, that Miss C would be in any position to continue
      residing in the UK.



  31.  The fact that she does have relatives here such that residence  would
      be theoretically possible, does not mean that in practice, she will be
      able to exercise her  right  of  residence,  were  her  mother  to  be
      removed. She would in effect be compelled to leave  with  her  mother,
      given that there is no one in the UK in  a  position  to  proper  look
      after her, and it is wholly wrong given her young age at just 3  years
      old, to suggest that she should in such circumstances be brought up by
      someone other than a parent. I therefore find that  Miss  C,  being  a
      relevant British citizen child would be unable to reside in the UK  or
      in another EEA state if the Appellant  were  required  to  leave.  The
      provisions of Regulations15A (4A) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations
      2006 are therefore satisfied  and  the  Appellant  is  entitled  to  a
      Derivative right of residence and to the issue  of  a  Residence  card
      under Regulation  17.  The  appeal  is  therefore  allowed  under  the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.


  32. In such circumstances, I do not need to go on to consider the question
      as to whether or not Article  8  is  engaged  in  this  case,  as  the
      Appellant has been successful in  her  application  for  a  Derivative
      Residence Card under Regulation 15A.

  33. I therefore allow the Appellant's appeal
