                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant, who was the  appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal ('FtT'). I will therefore refer to the  parties  as
    they were referred to by the FtT.

 2. The appeal is against a decision of a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal,
    Judge G Mitchell, promulgated on  27th  September  2019,  by  which  he
    dismissed the appellant's appeal on  the  basis  that  the  FtT  lacked
    jurisdiction to hear an appeal.  The gist of the  background  was  that
    the appellant had applied for indefinite leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
    General Migrant, using Form SET(O), which the respondent  had  rejected
    on 22nd September 2017, on the basis that there was a disparity between
    the earnings declared to HM Revenue and  Customs  and  the  information
    provided by the appellant on his earlier application for limited  leave
    to remain in 2011.  Under  the  points-based  system  of  Tier  1,  the
    respondent  then  disregarded  any  earnings  and  concluded  that  the
    appellant failed to  satisfy  paragraph  245CD(g)  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. A subsequent application  for  administrative  review  was  also
    rejected on 20th  October  2017.  The  administrative  review  decision
    contained a "one-stop" notice under section  120  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. In response, the  appellant  both  appealed  to  the  FtT  and  brought
    judicial review proceedings.  The statutory appeal was brought  on  the
    basis that the respondent ought to have appreciated that by the time of
    the refusal of administrative  review,  the  appellant  had  10  years'
    continuous lawful residence and was therefore entitled to remain  under
    Paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules, as he had been  granted  leave
    to enter on 7 April 2007. The appellant also issued a  judicial  review
    claim,  described  by  the  FtT   as   protectively   challenging   the
    respondent's decisions. That application was apparently resolved by way
    of a consent order under which the applicant withdrew his  application,
    upon the respondent agreeing to withdraw her decision of 22nd September
    2017 and for the respondent to reconsider the  appellant's  application
    as a Tier 1 Highly Skilled Worker within three months of that date.

 4. Following her reconsideration, on  2nd  February  2019  the  respondent
    confirmed its refusal in similar terms to  the  refusal  in  2017,  but
    added that the Immigration Rules now included provisions for applicants
    wishing to remain in the UK on the basis of their  family  and  private
    life and that since the appellant had not made a valid application  for
    article 8 consideration, consideration had not been given as to whether
    his removal from the UK would breach his rights under article 8 of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights ('ECHR').

 5. A hearing on 5th February 2019 before the FtT to consider  his  ongoing
    statutory appeal was adjourned with directions to  the  respondent  "to
    consider the appellant's claim that he  satisfied  the  long  residence
    rules."  Those directions were not complied with.   Judge Mitchell,  in
    the later hearing, questioned the basis on which the FtT had the  power
    to make such a direction, which was without written reasons.

 6. In the later hearing before Judge Mitchell, the respondent argued  that
    the 21st June 2016  application  was  not  a  human  rights  claim;  no
    decision had been taken to refuse a human rights claim;  and  that  the
    respondent  would  not  provide  consent  to  any  new  matters   being
    considered by the FtT.

The FtT's decision

 7.  The  FTT  concluded  that  the  appellant  had  made  a  human  rights
    application, not in the 21st June 2016 application, but  in  subsequent
    correspondence from his legal representative dated 17th December  2017,
    which referred to long  residence  and  obstacles  to  the  appellant's
    integration in his country of origin. However, the respondent  had  not
    made a decision to refuse any  human  rights  claim.   The  lack  of  a
    refusal was acknowledged by the appellant both  in  the  correspondence
    dated 17th December 2017 and later correspondence dated  20th  February
    2020.

 8. Accordingly, the appellant did not have the right to bring a  statutory
    appeal against the February 2019 decision and  the  FtT  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal on the basis of lack of jurisdiction.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 9. The appellant  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  which  are  essentially  as
    follows:

      1. Ground (1) - the FtT had erred in concluding  that  the  respondent
         had not made a decision refusing his human rights claim.  At  �[88]
         of their decision in Balajigari v SSHD [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673,  the
         Court of Appeal confirmed that the making  of  the  decision  which
         deprived  the  applicant  leave  to  remain  was   in   itself   an
         interference with an applicant's article 8 rights. The respondent's
         refusal letter of 2nd February 2019, which refused the  appellant's
         2016 application, encroached on the appellant's article 8 rights.

      2. Ground (2) - it was incumbent on the FtT to apply the authority  of
         Baihinga (r. 22; human rights  appeal:  requirements)  [2018]  UKUT
         00090 (IAC), which meant the respondent ought to have  treated  the
         appellant's 2016 application as including a human rights claim. The
         FtT also had before him a valid statutory appeal.

      3. Ground (3) - it was incumbent  on  the  FtT  to  have  allowed  the
         appellant  to  adduce  evidence  of  10  years'  continuous  lawful
         residence - see: OA and Others (human rights; 'new matter';  s.120)
         Nigeria [2019] UKUT 00065 (IAC).

10. First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes  granted  permission  on  28th  January
   2020, regarding it as arguable that the FtT had erred in finding that the
   respondent had made no decision to refuse a human rights claim. While not
   part of the binding decision of the Court of Appeal in Balajigari, it was
   clearly its opinion at �[99] that refusal of an application  where  human
   rights had been  raised  could  amount  to  refusal  of  a  human  rights
   application.  While the ground relating to a failure to  admit  documents
   or issue directions appeared to be weak, the grant of permission was  not
   limited in its scope.

Directions in the light of Covid-19

11. Upper Tribunal Judge  Canavan  issued  directions  on  11th  May  2020,
    indicating that on her provisional view, the questions of  whether  the
    FtT had erred in law and whether his decision should be set aside could
    be resolved without a hearing. The parties  were  directed  to  provide
    further submissions and where, despite the provisional view  expressed,
    they regarded a hearing as necessary,  they  were  required  to  submit
    reasons for that view.

12. Both parties responded, agreeing that the issues of whether  there  was
    an error of law and whether the decision of the FtT should be set aside
    could be resolved on the papers.

13. I have considered the matter afresh and endorse  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Canavan's view that the determination of the error of law  and  whether
    the FtT's decision should be  set  aside  can  be  resolved  without  a
    hearing. The reason for this is that the scope of the issues is clearly
    outlined, limited to narrow legal issues, and documented. There  is  no
    suggestion that there are further submissions which could only be  made
    at a hearing, which had not been addressed in the appeal.  I  therefore
    conclude that it is in accordance with the overriding objective that  I
    reach a decision on the error of law and  whether  the  FtT's  decision
    should be set aside, on the papers.

The parties' submissions

14. Both parties' submissions were very brief.

15. The appellant  referred  to  the  case  of  Birch  (Precariousness  and
    mistake; new matters) [2020] UKUT 00086 (IAC). The FtT had referred  to
    the  respondent  ignoring  directions  to  consider   the   appellant's
    application on the basis of his long residence and the  Upper  Tribunal
    was not limited in what  it  could  consider  as  a  new  matter.   The
    appellant met the 10-year long residence  provisions,  which  would  be
    determinative in any proportionality assessment  of  his  human  rights
    (see:  TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 1109).

16. The respondent relied on MY (refusal  of  human  rights  claims  claim)
    Pakistan [2020] UKUT 89 (IAC). The appellant had  complained  that  the
    respondent had not reached a decision on his human rights  application,
    which was inconsistent with his assertion that there had been a refusal
    of his human rights  appeal,  which  generated  a  statutory  right  of
    appeal.

Discussion and conclusions

17. Neither party now disputes that the appellant has made what constitutes
    a human rights application.  The FtT determined this not to be the 2016
    application, but follow-up correspondence from  the  appellant's  legal
    representative, Mr Jones of Garden Court Chambers, dated 17th  December
    2017, following a "one-stop" notice.

Ground 1

18. The first ground asserts that the FtT erred in concluding that the  2nd
    February 2019 decision did not amount to a refusal of  the  appellant's
    human rights application. The appellant essentially seeks to argue that
    because the respondent's refusal of his 2016 Tier 1 application has the
    effect of refusing his continuing leave  to  remain  in  the  UK,  that
    effectively amounts to a refusal of his human rights claim,  which  the
    FtT found separately to have been  made  in  the  2017  correspondence.
    Ground  (1)  fails  in  two  respects.   First,  while  the   appellant
    acknowledges, in submissions, MY, the appellant's  submissions  do  not
    engage with that authority, in the sense of dealing with the principles
    outlined in that case.  By way of reminder, these are as follows:

         "56. Section 82(1)(b) requires there to have been a decision on the
         claim. That, in turn, at least strongly suggests  there  must  have
         been engagement with the claim. The outcome of that engagement must
         have been to "refuse" the claim.  In  the  light  of  paragraph  55
         above, a decision to refuse  a  human  rights  claim  requires  the
         respondent to reach a decision that the person concerned  does  not
         have a case for remaining in the United Kingdom by reference to his
         or her, or anyone else's, human rights...

         59.  Even if the respondent's reason for not considering the  human
         rights claim was legally erroneous, it would still be the case that
         the human rights claim had not been considered  by  her.  Any  such
         error would be judicially reviewable, on public  law  grounds;  but
         that would need to be by application to the Upper Tribunal, not  by
         way of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal...

         62.  Second, if one analyses the communication that  the  appellant
         received from the respondent  in  September  2018,  it  is  in  two
         entirely separate parts.  The  part  that  says  "you  applied  for
         indefinite leave to remain ... your application is refused" is  the
         decision. The reasons for that decision are, for present  purposes,
         immaterial. That includes the paragraph which says any human rights
         submissions have not been considered. The decision to  refuse  has,
         therefore, to be treated as a decision to refuse the  human  rights
         claim, which the appellant had made, compatibly with  section  113,
         along with his application under the Rules.

         63.  The implications for the respondent and the appellate process,
         if Ms Mair is right,  are  potentially  serious.  It  is  therefore
         necessary to examine the appellant's case by going  back  to  first
         principles.

         64.  The respondent has been  given  the  function  by  Parliament,
         through the Immigration Acts, of deciding applications  from  those
         who require leave to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom.  As  a
         general matter, the respondent is the primary decision maker,  with
         her decisions being subject to a right of appeal to the  First-tier
         Tribunal under the 2002 Act or to judicial review, where a right of
         appeal does not exist.

         65.  In the appellate context, the position  of  the  Secretary  of
         State as primary decision- maker  is  necessarily  subject  to  the
         requirements of the ECHR and the Refugee  Convention,  which  focus
         attention on the present position, as it  is  at  the  date  of  an
         appeal hearing. Nevertheless, section 85(5)  contains  a  mechanism
         for the respondent to  consent  to  the  consideration  of  "a  new
         matter" by the First-tier Tribunal.

         66.  If the appellant is correct as  to  the  proposition  we  have
         articulated in  paragraph  61  above,  the  respondent  would  find
         herself in the following position. If  she  maintains  her  current
         stance of engaging with human rights claims only if made by way  of
         particular forms and in particular  circumstances,  the  respondent
         faces the prospect of the First-tier Tribunal becoming the  primary
         decision-maker in what may be a significant number of human  rights
         cases. The alternative is for the respondent to abandon her current
         practice.

         67.   We  find  the  appellant's  first  proposition  involves   an
         impermissible "reading-down" of section 50 of the 2006 Act and  the
         Rules made under it; and of the relevant case law. The respondent's
         ability, pursuant to section 50 of  the  2006  Act,  to  require  a
         specified procedure  to  be  followed  in  making  or  pursuing  an
         application or claim, and, in particular, in requiring the use of a
         specified form (along with the payment of a fee) has been  endorsed
         by the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Shrestha.  Although  that  case  was
         concerned with a  section  120  Notice,  paragraphs  29-33  of  the
         judgment  of  Hickinbottom  LJ  acknowledged  the  power   of   the
         respondent to regulate the way in  which  applications  and  claims
         fall for consideration under the Immigration Acts. The way in which
         the respondent does so may, of course, be  subject  to  public  law
         challenge. However, there is no suggestion  in  Shrestha  that  the
         Court had difficulties with the respondent's stance (which differed
         from that in Ahsan), whereby the  respondent  will,  as  a  general
         matter, engage with an application or claim only  if  made  in  the
         specified manner, until the point at which the individual concerned
         is subject  to  removal  directions,  when  no  formality  will  be
         necessary. We reject Ms Mair's  attempt  to  distinguish  Shrestha;
         although concerned with section 120, it contains an endorsement  of
         the respondent's practice that has relevance to the present case.

         68.  Importantly, at paragraph 102  of  Balajigari,  the  Court  of
         Appeal, in discussing the formal requirements,  noted  counsel  for
         the Secretary of State as making it clear:

             "...that the Secretary of State was not minded  to  waive  the
             formal requirements generally so as to facilitate appeals  (as
             opposed to applications for judicial review) in all cases.  As
             the legislation now stands, that appears to be a  stance  that
             he is entitled to take".

         We are, accordingly, satisfied that the respondent is entitled,  as
         a general matter and subject to her overriding public  law  duties,
         to adopt the position whereby, even if a communication is given  to
         her which satisfies the definition of a  "human  rights  claim"  in
         section 113, she is not for that reason alone  necessarily  obliged
         to engage substantively with the claim in order to  decide  whether
         it should be granted or refused. The respondent can, therefore,  as
         a general matter lawfully  respond  to  a  human  rights  claim  by
         declining to consider it."

19. Applying these principles to the facts as considered by  the  FtT,  the
    effect of the respondent's refusal of 2nd February 2019 could not  have
    been clearer - it was to refuse a Tier 1 application; to then refer, at
    page [9] of the appellant's bundle, to the respondent's changes to  the
    Immigration Rules which:

         "set out the requirements for  those  seeking  leave  to  enter  or
         remain on the basis of respect for private or family life....If you
         wish the Home Office to consider an application on this  basis  you
         must make a separate  charged  application  using  the  appropriate
         specified application form....Since  you  have  not  made  a  valid
         application for Article 8 consideration, consideration has not been
         given as to whether your removal from the UK would breach Article 8
         of the ECHR."

20. The appellant's citing of Birch is in fact a new  ground,  relating  to
    the ability of the Upper Tribunal to consider new matters, even  absent
    consent from the respondent. Even had I permitted an amendment  to  the
    ground, which I do not, it does not  assist  the  appellant.   In  that
    case, the Upper Tribunal was remaking a decision on a  valid  statutory
    appeal. There is no such valid statutory appeal here.

21. In summary, the FtT was unarguably entitled to conclude  that,  whether
    in error or not, the  respondent  had  expressly  declined  to  make  a
    decision on the appellant's article 8 claim.  Ground (1) must therefore
    fail.

Ground 2

22. The first part of ground (2), namely whether the  respondent  ought  to
    have considered the appellant's article 8 claim,  is  answered  by  the
    authority of MY above, a reported Presidential decision which expressly
    considered Baihinga.  As �[59] of MY confirms, the appropriate route to
    challenge a failure to consider a human rights application, as  opposed
    to a refusal of that application, is by  way  of  judicial  review.  In
    relation to the second part  of  the  ground,  in  the  absence  of  an
    appealable decision, the FtT did not have before him a valid  statutory
    appeal, which he had jurisdiction  to  consider.   For  these  reasons,
    ground (2) must also fail.

Ground (3)

23. This ground asserts that  the  FtT  ought  to  have  admitted  evidence
    relevant to the appellant's continuous lawful residence (not a basis of
    2019 refusal).  The flaw in this ground  is  that  there  was  a  human
    rights decision and valid statutory appeal before  the  FtT  and  Upper
    Tribunal, as well as consent by the respondent  to  consider  the  "new
    matter" in OA and Others.  In contrast, in this appeal, for the reasons
    set out, there was no human rights decision by the respondent;  and  no
    valid  statutory  appeal  before  the  FtT.  While  continuous   lawful
    residence might well be relevant to whether a statutory  appeal  should
    succeed against the refusal of a human rights claim, there has been  no
    such refusal and therefore the FtT cannot be criticised for refusing to
    admit evidence that was not relevant to the question  of  jurisdiction,
    or to seek compliance with directions on the point. This  final  ground
    must also therefore fail.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error on a point of law. The First-tier Tribunal's decision  is  upheld  and
the appellant's appeal is dismissed.
