For the Appellant:  The sponsor (Mr Mohd. Ishtiaq) in person
For the Respondent: Mr S Staunton

                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Jetsun Lebasci), sitting at Newport on 18 July 2016, to
     a dependent relative  appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born  7  August
    1998. On  17  September  2015,  well  before  his  18th  birthday,  the
    appellant applied for a visa to join his father (the sponsor)  who  has
    limited leave to remain in this country as a tier 1  migrant from  2012
    to 17 June 2018.

 2. Since the appellant was still  living  with  his  mother  in  Pakistan,
    paragraph 319H (f) of the Immigration Rules required that

        (ii) The Relevant Points Based System Migrant parent  has  and  has
        had sole responsibility for the applicant's upbringing, or
        (iii)  there  are   serious   or   compelling   family   or   other
        considerations which would make it  desirable  not  to  refuse  the
        application and suitable arrangements have been made in the UK  for
        the applicant's care.
 3. On 16 October 2015, the entry clearance officer  concluded,  in  rather
    general terms, that the appellant did not satisfy the  requirements  of
    paragraph 319H (f). However neither the entry clearance manager nor the
    judge was satisfied, either that the appellant had sole  responsibility
    for the appellant, nor that there  were  the  'serious  and  compelling
    reasons' required to make it undesirable  to  refuse  the  application.
    Permission to appeal was given on the basis  that  the  judge  had  not
    considered the applicant's human rights grounds, to which  by  date  of
    the decision under appeal he was limited. However no points  linked  to
    the facts of the case, but outside the Rules, were made on that aspect,
    either in the sponsor's grounds of appeal, or in  his  very  articulate
    oral submissions before me.

 4. The sponsor's grounds of appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  do  not
    mention anything outside the appellant's personal situation, and  their
    only reference to human rights is a general one to "session  6  of  the
    Human Rights Act 1998". The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  do
    mention one terrorist outrage in Pakistan, but without  any  suggestion
    that the appellant or his family have been personally affected. Details
    of recent outrages, including some in Rawalpindi, where they live, were
    added in the sponsor's application for  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Court of Appeal: this was the result of  a  decision  reached  after  a
    hearing of which he had not had notice, and caused it to be  set  aside
    by the hearing judge.

 5. The sponsor referred to these outrages  again  before  me;  but  first,
    there was nothing before the first-tier judge to  show  any  article  3
    risk to this appellant; and second, nothing in the facts now relied  on
    to show it either. Life may be difficult in Pakistan; but  it  goes  on
    for the vast majority of its people.

 6. Returning to the appellant's family situation, the original grounds  of
    appeal said the sponsor was "... our sole  and  main  financer  who  is
    providing all necessities of life according to our Islamic culture  and
    tradition". The judge said at paragraphs 10 and 11 that there  was  not
    enough evidence to  support  that,  and  the  sponsor  criticized  that
    finding, on  the  basis  of  what  had  been  sent  in  with  the  visa
    application.

 7. However, the judge did note that there was evidence about the sponsor's
    income: an accountant's report for the year  ending  28  February  2015
    showed he made a  net  profit  of  ï¿½27,807  as  a  self-employed  legal
    consultant. The judge was right in  saying  there  that  there  was  no
    direct evidence of support from him for the  applicant.  No  doubt  the
    sponsor would have been perfectly able to support him and the  rest  of
    the family in Pakistan; but the judge ended her paragraph  10  in  this
    way:

       ... even if he has been their sole source of income  he  has  clearly
       not had sole responsibility for the Appellant's  upbringing,  at  the
       very least this has been shared with the Appellant's  mother  and  it
       seems the Appellant's grandmother has also played a role.

 8. The judge also referred to details of the sponsor's income at paragraph
    11, in dealing with the arrangements made for the appellant's  care  in
    this country, under paragraph 319H (f) (iii). Again she was correct  in
    saying that there were no details of his planned living arrangements in
    the evidence provided; the sponsor might well have been  able  to  look
    after him here, but the judge was not required to assume that.

 9. The question of living arrangements here did not arise unless the judge
    had been satisfied that there were 'serious  or  compelling  family  or
    other considerations which would make it desirable not  to  refuse  the
    application'. The grounds of appeal describe the appellant's mother  as
    sick and unable to travel here or look after him or his sister; so  his
    paternal grandmother had been taking care of them. They  said  she  had
    high blood pressure and breathing problems. The judge dealt  with  this
    at paragraph 11, saying the appellant had not been able to provide  any
    medical evidence to support this.

10. That finding was criticized before me by the sponsor, who  referred  me
    to notes taken at a hospital in Rawalpindi when the appellant's  mother
    visited their emergency department on 22 November 2015. That  was  just
    over a month after the date of the decision under appeal; but the notes
    could have been relevant to her  condition  at  that  time,  so  I  was
    prepared to consider them. In short handwritten form, they show, so far
    as they are intelligible to  a  lay  reader,  that  she  complained  of
    headache, vertigo and lower back pain: her blood pressure  does  appear
    rather high, even to  me;  but  she  was  discharged  with  advice  and
    medication.

11. Since the appellant was already 17 by the date of the decision, and his
    grandmother was able to give him as provide him with a home, in my view
    the judge was fully  entitled  to  take  the  view  that  his  mother's
    complaints did not amount to 'serious or  compelling  family  or  other
    considerations  which  would  make  it  desirable  not  to  refuse  the
    application'. It follows that she was fully entitled  on  the  evidence
    before her to take the view that the  appellant  did  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of either paragraph 319H (f) (ii) or (iii).

12. Nor, on that evidence, was there anything to show that  it  would  have
    been disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of  ,  so  contrary  to
    article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, to  refuse  the  appellant  a
    visa. Just as there was nothing in the evidence  provided  to  show  he
    satisfied the requirements of paragraph 319H (f), so there was  nothing
    in it to show any particular reason why  he  should  nevertheless  have
    been given a visa. The judge had to start from the Immigration Rules in
    considering the Human Rights Convention; and it is quite clear from her
    findings of fact on those that she would have reached the  same  result
    if she had done so.

13. The sponsor's final complaint was of what he described as bias  on  the
    part of the First-tier Tribunal. This did not relate to anything in the
    judge's decision itself, but to the date when it was issued, 10  August
    2016. The sponsor said he had made three calls to the hearing centre to
    get hold of it; but I do not think three weeks amounted to undue  delay
    on the part of a judge who was not at that centre  all  the  time.  The
    sponsor's real complaint was that by then, the appellant was just  over
    18; so he was unable to make another application  with  any  chance  of
    success.


14. This may have been unfortunate for an appellant who had made  his  visa
    application in reasonable time before his 18th birthday; but the  judge
    dealt with him as someone who was still 17 at the date of the  hearing,
    and that was what he was entitled to from her. I do not think the  time
    taken to issue her decision remotely raises an issue of  bias;  and  it
    did nothing to show any arguable error of law in the reasons  she  gave
    for it.
