DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. In order to avoid confusion, the parties are referred to as they were  in
   the First-tier Tribunal.
3. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Heynes promulgated on 17 June  2015  which  dismissed  the
   Appellants appeals against decisions to remove them from the UK following
   refusal of their applications for leave to remain in the UK on family and
   private life grounds  on all grounds .
Background
4. The first and second Appellants (dates of  birth  21.7.71  and  12.10.76)
   are partners and parents of the third and fourth child Appellants and all
   are national of China. The two child Appellants were both born in the  UK
   and at the time of their applications in in July 2014, the relevant  date
   for the purpose  of  consideration  under  paragraph  276ADE,  the  third
   Appellant was 7� years old and the fourth Appellant was 3� years old.
5. In March 2000 the first Appellant entered the UK as a visitor  and  after
   his six months' entry clearance expired he remained in the UK unlawfully.
6.  The  second  Appellant  claims  to  have  entered  the  UK,   presumably
   unlawfully, sometime in 2003.
7. The third Appellant was born in the UK on 12 January 2007 and the  fourth
   on 24 December 2010.
8. On 17 July 2007 the first Appellant submitted an application for  an  EEA
   residence card with  his  family  as  dependents.  This  application  was
   refused.
9. On 6 June 2013 the  first  and  second  Appellants  were  encountered  by
   Immigration Officers working illegally (the  first  Appellant  was  later
   convicted of an offence relating to this)  and  served  with  notices  as
   overstayers.
10. On 21 June 2013 the first Appellant made an application for leave  based
   on family and private life which was refused on 13 August with  no  right
   of appeal.
11. On 7 July 2014 a further similar application was made and refused as  no
   fee was paid.
12. On 30 July 2014 a further similar application was made and refused  with
   no right of appeal.
13. On 5 December 2014 following a  PAP  letter  the  Respondent  agreed  to
   reconsider the application and issue an appealable decision.
14. 14 January 2015 an application for Judicial Review  was  lodged  in  the
   second Appellants name.
15. On 27 February 2015  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellants
   applications. The refusal letter considered the applications by reference
   to the Immigration Rules under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE and  then
   whether there were circumstances outside  the  Rules  which  warranted  a
   discretionary grant of leave. The reasons for refusal can  be  summarised
   as follows:
   a) Neither the first or second Appellant could succeed under the  partner
      route as they were not British citizens.
   b) Neither of the first or second Appellant could  meet  the  eligibility
      requirements for leave as a parent or under EX.1.
   c) In relation to the parents the relevant provision of the private  life
      requirements was 276ADE(vi) and it could not be said that there  would
      be very significant obstacles to them re  integrating  into  China  as
      they had lived the majority of their life in China.
   d)  The  third  Appellant  was  considered  by  reference  to   paragraph
      276ADE(iv) but given that her parents were not entitled to  leave  and
      her younger sister did not meet and of the private  life  requirements
      of 276ADE(i) it was considered reasonable for them to return to  China
      as a family unit.
   e) The  case  was  also  considered  under  the  heading  of  exceptional
      circumstances none of the maters advanced in support of that  argument
      were accepted to render the decision  to  refuse  leave  unjustifiably
      harsh.


The Judge's Decision
16. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Heynes ("the Judge") dismissed the appeals against the Respondent's
   decision. The Judge found :
17. In relation to the first and second Appellants he did  not  accept  that
   they had lost all ties to China (paragraph 24)
18. He did not accept that there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to
   them reintegrating back into China as they spoke the  language  and  also
   English which would help them find employment and he did not accept  that
   there would be such obstacles arising out of them having two children.
19. In respect or the proportionality of removing them  he  found  that  the
   balance was heavily in favour of removal (paragraph 25)
20.  In relation to the two children he found that their best  interest  was
   to remain with their parents and asked whether they overwhelmed all their
   factors.
21. He noted the  ages  of  the  children  and  that  neither  were  British
   citizens. He noted that they both enjoyed good health and education would
   be available to them in China. He did not find that it was  in  the  best
   interests of the third Appellant to remain in the UK.
22. He found that the decision to remove was proportionate.
23. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that the  Judge  did  not  address
   paragraph 276ADE(iv) in relation to the third  Appellant;  and  that  the
   Judge did not address paragraph 117B(6) of  the  Nationality  Immigration
   and Asylum Act  2002;  the  Judges  findings  at  paragraphs  19-23  were
   inadequately reasoned; the Judge failed to properly address the  position
   of the minor Appellants.

24. On 17 September 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford gave  permission  to
   appeal.

25. At the hearing I heard submissions from  Mr  Timson  on  behalf  of  the
   Appellants that:

   a) The Judge did not consider paragraph 276ADE(iv) and paragraph  117B(6)
      and the gaps could not be filled.

   b) While there was a reference to paragraph 276ADE (vi)  in  paragraph  4
      there was none to 117B(6)

   c) The test applied by the Judge in relation to paragraph  276ADE(vi)  in
      relation to the children

26. On behalf of the Respondent Mr Mc Vitie submitted that :

   a) He relied on the Rule 24 notice.

   b) He relied on the decisions in Dube (ss.117A-117D)  [2015]  UKUT  00090
      (IAC) and AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) where  the  courts
      stated that it is not an error of law to fail to refer to ss.117A-117D
      considerations if the judge  has  applied  the  test  he  or  she  was
      supposed to apply according to its terms; what matters  is  substance,
      not form.

   c) This case was, he suggested, a straightforward one where a couple  had
      come to the UK, overstayed , then used the  services  available  until
      they tried to regularise their status.

   d) There was only  one  qualifying  child  for  the  purposes  of  either
      paragraph 276ADE(1) (iv) or 117B(6) and that was the third  Appellant.
      But she had only just been here for 7 years, some of  that  period  in
      education, it was reasonable for her to return.

27. In reply Mr Timson on behalf of the Appellant submitted:

   a) The issue was not as simple as set out by Mr Mc Vitie: the  Judge  had
      not engaged with the circumstances. The reasons given were inadequate.



The Law

28.  Errors  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
   authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons,  ignoring  material
   considerations by taking into account immaterial considerations, reaching
   irrational  conclusions  on  facts  or  evaluation  or   giving   legally
   inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural unfairness, constitute
   errors of law.

29. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give  too
   little weight or too much weight to a  factor,  unless  irrationality  is
   alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge  to  fail  to
   deal with every  factual  issue  under  argument.  Disagreement  with  an
   Immigrations Judge's factual conclusions, his appraisal of  the  evidence
   or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of  risk  does  not  give
   rise to an error of law. Unless  an  Immigration  Judge's  assessment  of
   proportionality is arguable as being completely wrong, there is no  error
   of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge  not  to  have
   regard to evidence of events arising after his decision  or  for  him  to
   have taken no account of evidence that was not before him.
30. In MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641  (IAC),  it  was
   held that (i) It was axiomatic that a determination disclosed clearly the
   reasons for a tribunal's decision. (ii) If a tribunal found oral evidence
   to be implausible, incredible or unreliable or a document to be worth  no
   weight whatsoever, it was necessary to say so in  the  determination  and
   for such findings to be supported by reasons. A  bare  statement  that  a
   witness was not believed or that a document was afforded  no  weight  was
   unlikely to satisfy the requirement to give reasons.
31. Guidance was given as  to  the  general  approach  in  cases  involving
   children in  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (decisions  affecting  children;
   onward appeals)[2013] UKUT 197(IAC) (Blake J) where  the  Tribunal  held
   that (i)  The  case  law  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  identified  the
   following principles to assist in the  determination  of  appeals  where
   children are affected by the appealed decisions: (a) As a starting point
   it is in the best interests of children to be with  both  their  parents
   and if both parents are being removed from the United Kingdom  then  the
   starting point suggests that so should dependent children who form  part
   of their household unless there are reasons to the contrary; (ii) It  is
   generally in the interests  of  children  to  have  both  stability  and
   continuity of social  and  educational  provision  and  the  benefit  of
   growing up in the cultural norms of the society to  which  they  belong;
   (iii) Lengthy residence in a country other than the state of origin  can
   lead to development of social cultural  and  educational  ties  that  it
   would be inappropriate to disrupt, in the absence of  compelling  reason
   to the contrary. What amounts to lengthy residence is not clear cut  but
   past and present policies have identified  seven  years  as  a  relevant
   period; (iv)  Apart from the terms of published policies and rules,  the
   Tribunal notes that seven years from age  four  is  likely  to  be  more
   significant to a child that the first seven years of  life.  Very  young
   children are focussed on their parents rather than their peers  and  are
   adaptable; (v) Short periods of  residence,  particularly  ones  without
   leave or the reasonable expectation of leave to enter or  remain,  while
   claims are promptly considered, are unlikely to  give  rise  to  private
   life deserving of respect in the absence of exceptional factors. In  any
   event, protection of the economic well-being of society amply  justifies
   removal in such cases.


Finding on Material Error

32. Having heard those  submissions,  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made no errors of law that were material to the outcome in  this
   case.

33. I am satisfied that albeit the decision  in  this  case  was  relatively
   brief and rather unhelpfully unstructured when read  as  a  whole  it  is
   clear that the Judge had in mind all of the issues that he  was  required
   to assess in the decision.

34. The starting point  in  the  case,  the  background  against  which  the
   decision in relation to the children was made was that the parents  could
   not succeed under the family or private life requirements of  the  Rules.
   The Judge made a concise but well-reasoned decision setting  out  why  he
   did not find that there would be 'very  significant  obstacles'  to  them
   reintegrating to China the test he properly identified  at  paragraph  26
   and I do not find the reasons given are  inadequate.  Thus  he  found  at
   paragraph 24 that given the level of resourcefulness they  had  shown  in
   coming to the  UK  they  would  be  capable  of  reintegrating  in  China
   particularly given that he found they were not credible as to their claim
   that they had no family or ties there to assist them  in  that  endeavour
   (paragraph 24); he did not accept that having had  more  than  one  child
   would, by reference to the case law of AX (family planning scheme)  China
   CG [2012] UKUT 00097 (IAC) , present  such  obstacles  and  set  out  the
   reasons for that conclusion (paragraph 27); he suggested  that  no  other
   matters had been placed before him in support of the argument that  there
   were very significant obstacles but noted that the first  two  Appellants
   were Chinese nationals, could speak the language, were  resourceful,  and
   the English language skills could assist in finding  employment(paragraph
   28) I am therefore satisfied that the Judge gave adequate reasons for his
   conclusions under paragraph 276ADE(1) (iv) for the parents.

35. The Judge then went on to consider the position  of  the  parents  under
   Article 8 outside the Rules at paragraph 25 and identified that the issue
   was one of proportionality. Against the background of his findings  about
   them being overstayers, working illegally  and  accessing  services  they
   were not entitled to, he was entitled to find that the  balance  fell  in
   favour of the Respondents  legitimate  interest  in  immigration  control
   (paragraph 25).

36. The decision is challenged in relation in relation to  the  position  of
   both child Appellants generally but specifically in relation to the third
   Appellant who had been in  the  UK  for  7  years  at  the  time  of  the
   application and therefore potentially  could  meet  the  requirements  of
   paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) of the Immigration Rules or paragraph 117B(6)  of
   the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. I remind myself that  in
   determining whether this was an error of law that in AM the court found:

   "(6) When the question posed by s117B(6) is the same  question  posed  in
   relation to children by paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv)  it  must  be  posed  and
   answered in the proper context of whether it was reasonable to expect the
   child to follow its parents to their country of origin; EV (Philippines).
   It is not however a question that needs  to  be  posed  and  answered  in
   relation to each child more than once."

37. I note that as his starting point the Judge  identified  that  the  best
   interests of the children was a primary consideration (paragraph 29) I am
   satisfied that the Judge was entitled to approach this issue on the basis
   that a determination of what was in the best interests  of  the  children
   also incorporated what was reasonable.

38. The Judge therefore was entitled to conclude in accordance with  all  of
   the relevant case law that the starting point was that the best interests
   of the children was to remain with their parents who in this case had  no
   right to remain in the UK (paragraph 29). He recognised against a factual
   matrix which included his  previous  findings  about  the  family  having
   family in China and access to healthcare and education that the  children
   in this case were only 7 and 4 that neither child were  British  citizens
   but were Chinese Nationals who speak both English and Cantonese and  both
   were in good health there was  insufficient  evidence  to  conclude  that
   their best interest were to remain in the UK (paragraph 31) .  There  was
   no persuasive evidence before the Judge from any other source to  suggest
   that it would not be in the best interests of the children to return with
   their parents to China and  he  would  have  been  entitled  to  note  in
   accordance with Azimi Moayed that particularly given  their  ages,  other
   than the fact that the third child  was  in  the  early  years  of  their
   education in the UK there was little evidence to suggest close social and
   cultural ties outside their family.

39. Once the Judge found that it was in the best interests of  the  children
   to remain with their parents and therefore it reasonable for them  to  be
   returned to China section 117B(6) did not apply  but the other provisions
   under section 117B could be part of the overall assessment none of  which
   assisted the Appellants. The Judge was entitled to take into account  all
   of his findings to conclude that it was proportionate for the  family  to
   be returned together to China.

40. I was therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read as  a
   whole set out findings that were sustainable  and  sufficiently  detailed
   and based on cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

41. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

42. The appeal is dismissed.
