Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Themba Moyo (Sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pattersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to appellant as the respondent and to the  respondent  as
    the appellant (as they  appeared  respectively  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal). The appellant, Lucy Mpofu, was born on 5 November  1977  and
    is a female citizen of Zimbabwe.  She seeks to join her partner (Themba
    Moyo - hereafter referred to as the sponsor) with a view to  settlement
    in the United Kingdom.  Her application was refused by  the  respondent
    by a decision dated 14 January 2015.  The  appellant  appealed  to  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  A  K  Simpson)  which,  in   a   decision
    promulgated on 23 June 2016, allowed  the  appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds outside the Immigration Rules.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    (ECO) now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The issue in this appeal is a narrow one.  The  judge  found  that  the
    appellant had failed to satisfy the requirements for documents set  out
    in Appendix FM-SE.  Judge Simpson found that the sponsor (who is now  a
    British citizen) earned an income in excess of ï¿½18,000 per  annum  even
    though the documents required by Appendix FM-SE had not  been  produced
    to prove that income at the time of the application to  the  ECO.   The
    documents had been produced by time the matter reached  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  At [27], Judge Simpson observed that  "the  application  was
    refused not because of lack of finances  but  because  of  a  technical
    failure to comply with Appendix  FM-SE:  put  simply,  [the  appellant]
    failed  to  provide  her  original  marriage  certificate  to  complete
    Appendix 2."  Even at the date of the Tribunal hearing, the sponsor had
    not provided "a full set of payslips for all three  of  his  jobs  ..."
    Judge Simpson concluded that, "It is clear that the purposes and spirit
    of the legislation is satisfied even if  some  technical  details  have
    been omitted.  Consequently given that I am satisfied on the balance of
    probabilities that the appellant and her sponsor are in a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship, I take the  view  that  there  are  no  public
    interest factors justifying refusal."

 3. In Judge Simpson's analysis, it is  difficult  to  see  where  she  has
    identified exceptional circumstances to exist.  Moreover, there  is  no
    consideration as  to  whether  the  appellant  and  her  husband  could
    continue their family life together in Zimbabwe or, more  particularly,
    whether  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  being
    conducted there or elsewhere outside the United  Kingdom.   It  is  the
    failure to carry out this part of the analysis which,  in  my  opinion,
    represents a serious flaw in the decision.   Judge  Simpson  had  moved
    directly from the finding that the appellant only failed "for technical
    reasons" to a conclusion that it  must  be  appropriate  to  allow  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.  To do so ignores  the  jurisprudence  (SS
    (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and VW and MO (Uganda) [2008] UKAIT  00021)
    (which enjoins  the  Tribunal  to  consider  whether  family  life  may
    reasonably  be  enjoyed   outside   the   United   Kingdom.    In   the
    circumstances, I find that the decision of  the  judge  should  be  set
    aside.)  On the basis of the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, I
    am not satisfied that the appellant has shown that  family  life  could
    not  take  place  outside  the  United  Kingdom.   I  cannot   identify
    exceptional circumstances in the  facts  of  this  appeal  which  might
    justify consideration of Article 8 ECHR outside the requirement of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 4. However, I have no difficulty whatever in  upholding  the  findings  of
    fact which the judge made in her decision.  The appellant  and  sponsor
    are in a genuine and subsisting relationship.   The  sponsor  was  very
    anxious before the Upper Tribunal to point out that he and his wife had
    made no attempt to circumvent or breach the Immigration  Rules.   There
    is no suggestion that they have attempted to do so.   I  consider  that
    this is an entirely genuine application which  has,  as  Judge  Simpson
    observed, failed on account of a technicality.   The  problem  for  the
    appellant that Article 8 ECHR cannot, on the facts of the case, come to
    her assistance in this instance.  The sponsor told me that he now has a
    higher income and has given up of his three jobs.  It would be a simple
    matter for the appellant  to  make  a  further  application  for  entry
    clearance  to  ensure  this  time  that  the  requirements  as  to  the
    provisional documents are duly met.  If the sponsor's income is  as  he
    claims, then I seen no obstacle whatever to the appellant succeeding in
    an  application  for  entry  clearance.   In  particular,  and  to  the
    appellant's appeal against the ECO's decision has been dismissed should
    not account against her in any future application.



    Notice of Decision

 5. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 23 June 2016  is
    set aside.  I have remade the decision.  The appellant's appeal against
    the decision of the respondent dated 14 January 2015 is dismissed under
    the Immigration  Rules.   The  appeal  is  dismissed  on  human  rights
    grounds.

    No anonymity direction is made.
