Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr P. Deller , Senior  Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr A Berry of Counsel, instructed by Charles Russell
LLP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
                NOTICE OF APPELLANT'S WITHDRAWAL OF HER CASE


   1. At the hearing before me Mr Deller sought permission to  withdraw  the
      Appellant's grounds of challenge to the First -tier decision  allowing
      the appeal because of the particular circumstances of this Appellant.


   2. The relevant parts of Rule 17 provides
      "(1) Subject  to  paragraph  (2)  a  party  may  give  notice  of  the
      withdrawal of its case.
      (2) Notice of  withdrawal  will  not  take  effect  unless  the  Upper
      Tribunal  consents  to  the  withdrawal  except  in  relation  to   an
      application for permission to appeal."

   3. I consented to the application, finding the generosity of Mr  Deller's
      approach appropriate on the factual matrix.


   4. Following the withdrawal of the Respondent's case the determination of
      the  First  Tier  Tribunal,  allowing  the   Appellants'   appeal   on
      Immigration Rules grounds, stands.



Signed
