                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014. I continue that order.
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. The Appellant, a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the refusal of the Respondent on 21st January 2014  of
    her application for asylum in the UK.  Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    K W Brown dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  and  the  Appellant  now
    appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 2. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant arrived in  the  UK
    in April 2013 on a visit visa which she had been granted  following  an
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal on 17th January 2013.  The  Appellant
    came to the UK and overstayed and claimed asylum on 7th  January  2014.
    In summary the basis of the Appellant's claim is that she left Pakistan
    because her father had forced her into an engagement to a 60  year  old
    man whom she did not want to marry and that her father had been violent
    towards her and that she feared return to Pakistan on that basis.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the Appellant's claim was  not
    credible.  The judge found in the alternative that,  even  if  he  were
    wrong as to the Appellant's credibility, the Appellant  could  relocate
    within Pakistan.  The judge also dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  in
    relation to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Error of Law

 4. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis of quite lengthy  Grounds
    of Appeal.  Mr Richardson helpfully summarised those into  three  areas
    in which he claimed the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred.  He  contended
    that the judge erred  in  relation  to  his  credibility  findings,  in
    relation to his findings as to the viability of internal relocation and
    in relation to his assessment of Article 8.

 5. Firstly Mr Richardson conceded that the suggestion in  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal that the judge erred in  considering  the  psychiatric  evidence
    after making findings of credibility was  put  more  strongly  than  it
    should  have  been.   He  accepted  that  the  judge  made  credibility
    findings, then made findings in relation to the  medical  evidence  and
    then returned to credibility findings.  He  accepted  that,  whilst  it
    looks like that the judge made credibility findings first, the  grounds
    put the claim that this lead to an error too  strongly.   He  submitted
    that the real problem with the determination was not the order in which
    the judge addressed the matters but the fact that the judge ignored the
    potential corroborative effect of the medical evidence.   He  submitted
    that the medical evidence is corroborative in terms of the  Appellant's
    claim that she was forced to enter into an  engagement  and  the  judge
    ignored or failed to engage with the assessment by the  psychotherapist
    that the Appellant's claim was credible.

 6. Mr Richardson submitted that the judge failed to  have  regard  to  the
    history of referrals and the suicide attempts made by the Appellant and
    her psychiatric history.  He submitted that  the  judge  dismissed  the
    whole body of evidence in relation to the medical issues and that  this
    displayed an error of  approach  to  the  medical  or  psychoanalytical
    evidence.  He submitted that the judge erred in placing  no  weight  on
    the conclusions made by the psychoanalyst.

 7. Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge did look at all  of  the  medical
    evidence.  She submitted that the judge considered the psychoanalytical
    report at paragraph 22 and in that  paragraph  the  judge  acknowledged
    that the psychoanalyst came to the conclusion that the history provided
    to her by the Appellant was genuine.  However, she  submitted  that  it
    was for the Tribunal to assess credibility.   She  submitted  that  the
    judge considered all of the medical  evidence  at  paragraph  11.   She
    submitted that it was clear from paragraph 20 of the determination that
    the judge was aware of the Appellant's medical history in the UK.

 8. Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge noted the Appellant's evidence as
    to her diagnosis of  depression  in  Pakistan  at  paragraph  27.   She
    submitted that the judge noted that the  Appellant  was  depressed  and
    suffered from anxiety at paragraph 51  and  noted  that  there  was  no
    diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder although the Appellant  had
    symptoms.  She submitted that  the  judge  dealt  with  the  matter  at
    paragraph 52 where the judge said that the evidence  available  to  him
    was not conclusive that the Appellant has  any  serious  mental  health
    illness and not conclusive that any depression and stress  she  suffers
    is as a direct result  of  any  ill-treatment  she  received  from  her
    father.  She submitted therefore that the Grounds of Appeal amount to a
    disagreement with how the judge looked at the medical evidence.

 9. I find that the judge dealt properly with all of the  medical  evidence
    before him.  He considered all of the medical evidence.  He  considered
    the medical  evidence  in  the  round  along  with  all  of  the  other
    credibility findings.  It was not  for  the  judge  to  accept  without
    question an assessment as to credibility from an psychoanalyst but  the
    judge was clearly aware of the psychoanalyst's opinion in  relation  to
    this matter as indicated in paragraph 22.   I  am  satisfied  that  the
    judge took into account all of the relevant medical evidence along with
    the other credibility findings and that the judge reached findings open
    to him in relation to this matter.

10. Mr Richardson's second main submission was that the judge  applied  the
    wrong standard of proof.  He  submitted  that  the  judge  referred  to
    different standards as set out  in  paragraph  22  of  the  Grounds  of
    Appeal.  For example the judge used the words  "I  doubt  whether  ..."
    [49] and "I do not consider that this report is conclusive  ..."  [51].
    He submitted that this  displays  that  the  judge  applied  the  wrong
    standard of proof.   He  submitted  also  that  the  use  of  the  word
    "unreliable" [47] and the phrase "has no merit" [54] demonstrates  that
    the judge has not properly reasoned findings in relation to some of the
    evidence before him.  He submitted that paragraph 49 demonstrates  that
    the judge gave inadequate reasons.

11. He further submitted that the judge failed to have regard  to  what  is
    known from country guidance cases  and  the  background  evidence  when
    assessing credibility.  He failed to consider that  the  cultural  norm
    may be for the Appellant not to have met her fiancï¿½.

12. Ms Isherwood submitted that it  is  clear  from  paragraph  10  of  the
    determination that the judge applied the correct burden and standard of
    proof.  She accepted that the terminology may  be  criticised  but  she
    said that the judge dealt with the evidence appropriately and  the  use
    of the terminology does not mean  that  the  judge  applied  the  wrong
    standard.

13. I have considered the determination as a whole and I am satisfied  that
    the judge applied the correct standard of  proof  in  relation  to  his
    assessment of all of the evidence.  The  finding  at  paragraph  49  in
    relation to the delay was a finding open to the judge on the  basis  of
    the particular evidence before  him  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    application for a visit visa to the UK and  subsequent  appeal  against
    that and the evidence about the financial  status  of  the  Appellant's
    family.  I am satisfied that these findings were based on the  evidence
    before the judge and open to the judge on that basis.

14. I find that the judge's findings on credibility were open to him on the
    evidence before him and that he made no material error in his  findings
    as to the appellant's credibility.

15. The second main issue raised by Mr Richardson relates  to  the  judge's
    findings as to the viability of internal relocation. He submitted  that
    the finding at paragraph 50, that the Appellant's brother could protect
    her was inadequate as it was not couched in  terms  of  sufficiency  of
    protection or of internal relocation.  The judge said at paragraph  56:
    "Even if I am wrong  in  my  primary  finding  as  to  the  appellant's
    credibility I have no doubt that the appellant who is  a  well-educated
    woman can live safely in another  area  of  Pakistan".   Mr  Richardson
    submitted that the test is not whether the Appellant can live safely in
    another area but whether it is unduly harsh  or  unreasonable  for  the
    Appellant to relocate.  He submitted that the judge has got  it  wrong.
    He submitted that the judge said that  the  Appellant  could  seek  the
    assistance of women's groups or women's refuges if it was necessary for
    her to do so but has  not  taken  a  proper  approach  in  relation  to
    assessing whether it is reasonable for the Appellant to stay  there  or
    for how long the Appellant can stay in a women's refuge.

16. In relation to this  matter  Ms  Isherwood  submitted  that  the  judge
    properly applied the country guidance in the decision in KA and  Others
    (domestic violence - risk on return) Pakistan CG [2010] UKUT 216 as set
    out in paragraph 56  and  in  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter.   She
    submitted that the judge's assessment  in  relation  to  the  Appellant
    being a single woman returning to Pakistan is taken  directly  from  KA
    and that that finding was open to the judge and  that  this  submission
    was a mere disagreement with the judge's findings.

17. As I have found above, the judge made credibility findings  which  were
    open to him based on the evidence before him.  In  these  circumstances
    the judge did not need to consider internal relocation.  However,  even
    in considering internal relocation, I am satisfied that,  although  the
    judge used the phrase "can live safely in another area of Pakistan", it
    is clear that in the rest of that paragraph the  judge  is  considering
    whether it is  reasonable  for  the  Appellant  to  live  elsewhere  in
    Pakistan and I am satisfied that the findings made by  the  judge  were
    open to him on  the  basis  of  the  evidence  before  him  as  to  the
    Appellant's family and personal circumstances.

18. Finally, Mr Richardson submitted that the judge's findings in  relation
    to Article 8 were inadequate in that the judge said that  he  concurred
    with the reasons set out in the reasons for refusal letter but did  not
    look at whether there were compelling reasons  to  consider  Article  8
    outside of the Immigration Rules [57].  He  submitted  that  the  judge
    failed to consider the Appellant's mental health problems,  her  family
    in the UK and the evidence of the psychotherapist in this context.

19. Ms Isherwood submitted that the Appellant's  submission  of  statements
    from her family members with the Grounds of Appeal  was  indicative  of
    the fact that she had not put forward sufficient  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  At the first  hearing  none  of  the  Appellant's
    family members gave oral evidence.  There were no statements before the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  She submitted that it  could  not  be  said
    that Article 8 is engaged.  There was nothing put forward which differs
    from the position in the reasons for refusal letter and because of  the
    lack of evidence any error that the judge made in relation to Article 8
    is not material.

20. I am satisfied that the judge did not make any material error of law in
    considering Article 8 of the ECHR.  In light of the judge's findings in
    relation to the circumstances in Pakistan the Appellant could not  have
    demonstrated that it would be  a  breach  of  her  private  life  under
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules to return  her  to  Pakistan.
    There was no evidence from the Appellant's family and the  judge  would
    have had difficulty in reaching a conclusion  that  the  Appellant  had
    demonstrated that she had established  family  life  in  the  UK.   The
    Appellant was aware that this would  be  an  issue  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  but  did  not  seek  evidence  from  her  family  members  to
    demonstrate the strength of any family ties.

21. I find that, although the reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is
    brief and relates back to the reasons for refusal letter, there  is  no
    material error in the judge's assessment of Article 8 because he  could
    not have reached an alternative conclusion on the evidence before him.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge does not disclose  a  material
error of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
