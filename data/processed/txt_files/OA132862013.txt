Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mills, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:     Mr Murphy, Counsel.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this determination the Secretary of State is referred as  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer. The Respondent is referred as the claimant.

2.   The claimant, a national of India, date  of  birth  10  February  1990,
    appealed against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision,  dated  8  May
    2013, to refuse entry clearance as a partner under Appendix FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules with particular reference to paragraph EC-P.1.1.  The
    refusal was  on  three  grounds.   First,  a  failure  to  provide  the
    necessary evidence of gross annual income to meet the �8,600 threshold;
    secondly, a failure to produce bank statements to  show  salary  relied
    upon passing into and out of the Sponsor's bank account; and Thirdly, a
    failure  to  provide  specified  documents  evidencing  the   Sponsor's
    employment.

3.   These refusals were with reference to paragraph  2  of  Appendix  FM-SE
    and under EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM-SE and under EC-P.1.1(d) of  Appendix
    FM (E-ECP.3.1).

4.   The matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge A Metzer  who,  on  15
    July 2014, allowed the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

5.   Permission to appeal was given to the Secretary of State by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Saffer on 4 August 2014.

6.   The judge  properly  concluded,  and  indeed  it  was  wholly  properly
    conceded by Mr Murphy who appeared on behalf of the Claimant, that  the
    Claimant could not come within the Rules and  therefore  the  case  was
    directly argued without further ado by reference to  the  circumstances
    which it was said meant that the Claimant would now, as at the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  on  30  June  2014,  through  the
    Sponsor meet the financial requirements.  The judge having  found  that
    the Claimant did not meet  those  financial  requirements  nevertheless
    originally followed the  decision  in  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900  and  the
    decision in the High Court by Mr Justice Blake who expressed  the  view
    that the financial limits were not sustainable in law. The views of  Mr
    Justice Blake were overturned by the Court of Appeal in the case of  MM
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  In that respect the First-tier judge erred.   But
    the judge went on to  conclude  that  because  the  Appellant  did  not
    succeed at the date of decision:  Nevertheless  in  the  light  of  the
    sponsor's present full-time employment  now  the  earnings  or  average
    gross income was in excess of the �18,600  limit.  Accordingly  it  was
    disproportionate to require the claimant to  make  further  application
    and the judge allowed the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.

7.   It is unarguable that the judge  made  that  decision  considering  the
    matter as at  the  date  of  the  hearing  and  failed  to  recall  the
    longstanding case law, particularly of  AS  (Somalia)  [2009]  UKHL  32
    which makes plain that in Section 82(1) appeals there  are  limitations
    the appeal confined to the date of the ECO's decision.

8.   In these circumstances the approach the judge took  was  wrong  in  law
    the Article 8 ECHR case could not have been determined as and  when  he
    thought it did.  It is clear that the judge found that the Sponsor gave
    reliable  and  truthful  evidence  concerning  his  current   financial
    circumstances. There was nothing to suggest  that  there  was  anything
    inappropriate or misleading or fraudulent as to the  evidence  that  he
    did provide. At this stage it is clear that the judge also never  dealt
    with the second and third bases upon which refusal had arisen.  Whether
    that was a matter of oversight is difficult to tell but it would appear
    to be so because otherwise it is hard to  see  how  he  could  have  so
    freely gone on to conclude, as  he  must  have  done,  that  all  other
    relevant elements of  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  were  met  and
    therefore it was disproportionate in the circumstances that  he  judged
    them to be in relation to the gross earnings.

9.   For these reasons I am satisfied  that  the  original  decision  cannot
    stand.  Accordingly the decision must be remade. Having  canvassed  the
    matter with the parties in the light of the findings,  I  am  satisfied
    that at the relevant date of the ECO's decision the Claimant could  not
    meet the relevant requirements of Appendix FM and at that same date the
    evidence of private/family life  rights  did  not  show  the  financial
    circumstances were  otherwise  nor  were  there  any  other  identified
    evidence  to  show  that  the  Secretary  of   State's   decision   was
    disproportionate or outwith the public interest under Article  8  ECHR.
    In reaching that conclusion I have taken into account the provisions of
    Section 117 A and 117B of the NIAA 2002.

10.  Accordingly, the  Claimant's  appeal  against  the  ECO's  decision  is
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

ANONYMITY

No anonymity was requested and none seems necessary or  appropriate  in  the
circumstances of the case.

FEE AWARD

The appeal has failed and therefore it is not  appropriate  to  make  a  fee
award in the sum of �140 paid.
