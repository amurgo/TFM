                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr McVeety Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: No attendance.

                            DECISION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of a
        panel of the First-tier Tribunal who allowed Mr  Monteiro's  appeal
        against the order for his deportation from the United Kingdom.
     2. Mr Monteiro is a national of Portugal born on the 26 November 1994.
        He entered the United Kingdom on 19 July 1999 with his parents  and
        siblings.
     3. Mr Monteiro has a record of criminal  activities  the  most  recent
        incidence of which resulted in his conviction at  Nottingham  Crown
        Court on the 20 March 2014 for the offence  of  wounding/inflicting
        grievous bodily harm. On 11 April 2014 Mr Monteiro was sentenced to
        two years detention in a young offenders institute and  ordered  to
        pay �100 victim surcharge. On  8  November  2014  Mr  Monteiro  was
        served with a notice of liability to deportation.



Discussion



     4. In the decision to make a deportation order dated 1 April  2015  it
        was accepted that Mr Monteiro has been in the  United  kingdom  for
        ten years in accordance with the 2006 Regulations and that  he  was
        entitled to the higher level  of  protection,  that  of  imperative
        grounds of public security.
     5. The panel noted in paragraph  34  of  the  determination  that  the
        circumstances of the index offence were violent in nature involving
        the use of a knife  and  bottle  and  that  Mr  Monteiro  had  been
        previously cautioned for sexual offences  and  that  his  behaviour
        appeared to be escalating. The  OASys  report  assessed  him  as  a
        medium risk to the public and to known adults. The  key  paragraphs
        of the findings are as follows:

             "36. In our view  the  appellant  would  satisfy  the  serious
             grounds for public policy test if he had only  been  here  for
             more than five years but this is not the test  in  this  case.
             We have to be satisfied that there are imperative grounds  for
             public security as he has been here for more than 10 years. In
             MG the imperative grounds are required to justify the decision
             and second grounds must relate to public security. In  MG  and
             VC the SSHD accepted that it was limited to terrorist activity
             although  in  a  reported  decision  it  was  said  that   the
             concession was not made.

             ...

             38. Whilst the lower threshold test has been  met  we  do  not
             believe for the reasons explained the imperative test has been
             met.  We have an appellant who has been convicted of a  single
             offence and received a caution for two  further  offences  and
             sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.  As the sentencing  judge
             remarks of Judge Hamilton notes that he  was  charged  with  a
             section 18 offence but convicted of a  lesser  offence  "If  I
             thought that this was a more serious  matter  indeed  had  the
             jury convicted you of section 18 you will be going  to  prison
             for a great deal longer.  The reality is that it is a category
             one offence and the starting point should be three years but I
             take the view that I start at the lower point because you have
             never been in trouble before and certainly nothing  like  this
             and you have been making efforts.  I am  told  to  do  charity
             work and because of your young age". The case  is  similar  to
             the facts of LG a person who served nine years  for  attempted
             murder.  There is a lower risk of re-offending  and  a  medium
             risk of serious harm to others."


     6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted  as  it  was
        said to be arguable that the panel had failed  to  deal  adequately
        with the cases of Tsakouridis and MG [2014].
     7. By virtue of Regulation 21(4) Immigration (European Economic  area)
        Regulations 2006 (as amended) a decision to remove may not be taken
        except on imperative grounds of public security in  respect  of  an
        EEA national who (a) has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
        continuous period of at least  ten  years  prior  to  the  relevant
        decision; or (b) is under  the  age  of  18,  unless  the  relevant
        decision is necessary in his best interests, as provided for in the
        Convention on the Rights  of  the  Child  adopted  by  the  General
        Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989.
     8. The general approach is in two stages (i) does the relevant conduct
        satisfy the  applicable  "public  policy"  criterion  (whether  the
        general one or the more or most stringent  one);  and  (ii)  if  it
        does, is the decision to remove a "proportionate" one  in  all  the
        circumstances. In this appeal the panel were not satisfied that the
        Secretary of State had shown that the first element of the test was
        met.
     9. In relation to the cases specifically mentioned in paragraph  3  of
        the grant of permission,  in Land Baden-W�rttemberg  v  Tsakouridis
        (Case C-145/09) CJEU (Grand Chamber), 23 November 2010  the test to
        be applied was essentially stated as follows:



             "48. It should  be  added  that  Article  27(2)  of  Directive
             2004/38 emphasises that the conduct of  the  person  concerned
             must represent a genuine and present threat to  a  fundamental
             interest of society or of the  Member  State  concerned,  that
             previous criminal convictions cannot in themselves  constitute
             grounds for taking public policy or public security  measures,
             and that justifications that are isolated from the particulars
             of  the  case  or  that  rely  on  considerations  of  general
             prevention cannot be accepted.

             49. Consequently, an expulsion measure must  be  based  on  an
             individual examination of the specific case (see, inter  alia,
             Metock and Others, paragraph 74),  and  can  be  justified  on
             imperative grounds of public security within  the  meaning  of
             Article 28(3) of Directive 2004/38 only if, having  regard  to
             the exceptional seriousness of the threat, such a  measure  is
             necessary for the protection  of  the  interests  it  aims  to
             secure, provided that that objective  cannot  be  attained  by
             less strict means, having regard to the length of residence of
             the Union citizen in the host Member State and  in  particular
             to the serious negative consequences such a measure  may  have
             for Union citizens who have become genuinely  integrated  into
             the host Member State.

             50. In the application of Directive 2004/38, a balance must be
             struck more particularly between the exceptional nature of the
             threat to public security as a result of the personal  conduct
             of the person concerned, assessed if  necessary  at  the  time
             when the expulsion decision is to be made  (see,  inter  alia,
             Joined Cases C-482/01 and C-493/01  Orfanopoulos  and  Oliveri
             [2004] ECR I-5257, paragraphs  77  to  79),  by  reference  in
             particular  to  the  possible  penalties  and  the   sentences
             imposed, the degree of involvement in the  criminal  activity,
             and, if appropriate, the risk of  reoffending  (see,  to  that
             effect, inter alia, Case 30/77  Bouchereau  [1977]  ECR  1999,
             paragraph 29), on the one hand, and, on the  other  hand,  the
             risk of compromising the social rehabilitation  of  the  Union
             citizen  in  the  State  in  which  he  has  become  genuinely
             integrated, which, as the Advocate General observes  in  point
             95 of his Opinion, is not only in his  interest  but  also  in
             that of the European Union in general."


    10. The key phrase in the judgment that "expulsion can be justified  on
        imperative grounds of public security within the meaning of Article
        28(3)  of  Directive  2004/38  only  if,  having  regard   to   the
        exceptional seriousness of the threat, such a measure is  necessary
        for the protection of the interests it  aims  to  secure,  provided
        that that objective cannot be attained by less strict means, having
        regard to the length of residence of the Union citizen in the  host
        Member State and in particular to the serious negative consequences
        such a  measure  may  have  for  Union  citizens  who  have  become
        genuinely integrated into  the  host  Member  State"  is  the  test
        applied by the panel who found it not proved that the threat was an
        exceptionally serious threat for  which  an  expulsion  measure  is
        necessary for the protection of the interests it aims to secure.
    11. In relation to MG and VC (Ireland) [2006] UKAIT 00053 the  Tribunal
        considered that this last test "... is at the very highest level of
        the calculus introduced  by  the  2006  Regulations  and  Directive
        2004/38/EC". First, imperative grounds are require to  justify  the
        decision and second those grounds must relate to  public  security.
        In MG and VC the SSHD accepted that it  was  limited  to  terrorist
        activity (although in the unreported decision of Chindamo  no  such
        concession was made.) In MG and VC the Tribunal  said  "we  do  not
        think that it is  a  phrase  which  is  appropriate  to  cover  the
        ordinary risk to society arising from  the  commission  of  further
        offences by a convicted criminal.  That is the risk  which  has  in
        the past been met by the removal  decisions  based  on  grounds  of
        public policy".  In LG (Italy) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 190 the Court
        of Appeal confirmed that an EEA national who had been here  for  10
        years  can  only  be  deported  on  imperative  grounds  of  public
        security, which bear a qualitative difference to the less stringent
        grounds applicable to deportation of those with shorter  residence.
        Imperative connoted a very high threshold and the  ground  requires
        an actual and compelling risk to  public  security,  though  public
        security need not be equated to national security.   The  Court  of
        Appeal said that "risk to the safety of the public or a section  of
        the public" seemed reasonably consistent with the ordinary  meaning
        of the test.  The Court seemed  to  be  of  the  opinion  that  the
        severity of the offence committed was not necessarily one  to  make
        removal "imperative". In VP (Italy) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 806  the
        Court of Appeal endorsed LG (Italy) v SSHD and said that imperative
        grounds of public security required not simply a serious matter  of
        public policy but an actual risk to public security  so  compelling
        that it justified an exceptional course of removing someone who had
        become integrated by many years residence in the host  state.   The
        severity of the offence could be a starting point for consideration
        but there had to be something more to  justify  a  conclusion  that
        that removal was imperative to the interests  of  public  security.
        So the appellant, an Italian who had been here since 1986  and  had
        served 9 years for attempting to  murder  his  ex  wife,  including
        twice trying to cut her throat  and  inflicting  32  knife  wounds,
        could not be removed when there  was  a  low  risk  of  reoffending
        albeit a medium risk of serious harm to others.
    12. Mr Monteiro entered the United Kingdom in 1999 and had been in this
        country for  fifteen  years  before  he  was  imprisoned  in  2014.
        Notwithstanding this the Secretary of States position  set  out  in
        paragraph 24 of the refusal letter dated 16 February 2014 was:

             "27. As you have not acquired a permanent right  of  residence
             under the 2006 Regulations consideration  has  been  given  to
             whether your deportation is justified  in  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security."


    13. The revised decision, dated 1 April 2015, is more detailed where it
        is stated:

             "27. In light of the documentary  evidence  submitted,  it  is
             accepted that you  have  been  continuously  resident  in  the
             United Kingdom for  10  years  in  accordance  with  the  2006
             Regulations.  Consequently consideration  has  been  given  to
             whether your deportation is justified on imperative grounds of
             public security."


    14. In paragraph 28 and 29 of the that decision it is stated:



             "28. It is accepted that you have acquired a  permanent  right
             to reside by virtue of a five  year  continuous  residence  in
             accordance with the EEA Regulations  between  1999  and  2014.
             Although it is also accepted that  you  have  resided  in  the
             United  Kingdom  for  at  least  10  years,  the  Home  Office
             considers that  you  do  not  automatically  qualify  for  the
             protection of imperative grounds of public security. The  Home
             Office has applied the "integration test" set out at  recitals
             23 and 24 of the Free Movement Directive and the CJEU case  of
             Tsakouridis  to  establish  whether  the  highest   level   of
             protection is  available  to  you.  The  following  have  been
             considered:

               a) the cumulative duration and frequency of any absences from
                  the United  Kingdom  during  the  qualifying  period  (and
                  reason for the absences)

               b) time spent in prison

               c) the overall length of your residence in the United Kingdom

               d) your family connections to the United Kingdom

               e) your links with your country of origin, and

               f) your age on arrival in the United Kingdom

             29.  Having  assessed  all  these  factors,  the  Home  Office
             considers that you meet the integration criteria, as  set  out
             in Tsakouridis. Consequently, consideration has been given  to
             whether your deportation is justified on imperative grounds of
             public security."


    15. No arguable legal error is made out in the panels  approach  to  Mr
        Monteiro's status which is in accordance with the  decision  letter
        which was written after the publication  of  the  decision  of  the
        Upper Tribunal in August 2014 of  MG  (prison-Article  28(3)(a)  of
        Citizens Directive) Portugal [2014] UKUT 00392 in which it was held
        that (i)  Article 28(3)(a) of Directive  2004/38/EC  contained  the
        requirement that for those who had resided in the host member state
        for the previous 10 years, an expulsion decision made against  them
        must be based upon imperative  grounds  of  public  security;  (ii)
        there was a tension in the judgment of the Court of Justice of  the
        European Communities in Case C-400/12 Secretary of State  v  MG  in
        respect of the meaning of the "enhanced protection" provision;  and
        (iii) the judgment should be understood as meaning that a period of
        imprisonment during those 10 years did not  necessarily  prevent  a
        person from qualifying for enhanced protection if that  person  was
        sufficiently integrated. However, according to the same judgment, a
        period of imprisonment must have a negative impact  in  so  far  as
        establishing integration was concerned.


    16. The panel arguably erred in their statement in  paragraph  27  that
        the Secretary of State's attempts to exclude Mr Monteiro  from  the
        enhanced  protection  of  Regulation  21(4)   by   introducing   an
        integration test is flawed, but that  has  not  been  shown  to  be
        material. The case law supports the need to consider the degree  of
        integration in relation to  assessing  entitlement  to  the  higher
        level of protection although in  this  case  the  higher  level  of
        protection had been obtained prior to the period  of  imprisonment.
        Mr Monteiro had lived in the United Kingdom for a period of fifteen
        years since entry to his loss of liberty and it had not  been  made
        out on the evidence that his conduct was such to show  he  was  not
        integrated at the date of the 1 April 2015 decision.
    17. It  is  also  accepted  that  in  assessing  whether  the  required
        threshold has been met all the relevant factors must be  considered
        but it had not been shown that the decision was not  propionate  on
        the basis of the materiel provided to the panel.
    18. The panel cannot be criticised for making reference to VP (Italy) a
        decision of the Court of Appeal that provided guidance in  relation
        to the test to be applied  in  such  cases.  The  panel  cannot  be
        criticised for finding the correct  test  was  that  of  imperative
        grounds as this is conceded by the Secretary of State as being  the
        correct starting point in this matter. The panel note at  paragraph
        14 of the determination that the view of the Secretary of State  is
        that notwithstanding the  imperative  ground  test  the  threat  of
        serious harm posed by Mr Monteiro to the public was  such  that  it
        was  considered  that  the  circumstances  do  not   preclude   his
        deportation. The panel did not agree and found  that  although  the
        test of serious grounds had been met the higher level if imperative
        grounds  had  not.  The  panel  clearly  considered  the  competing
        arguments and warn Mr Monteiro in relation to his future conduct in
        paragraph 39 of the decision.
    19. Mr McVeety has not been able to establish today that on  the  facts
        available to the panel their conclusion was not one  properly  open
        to them. It has not been shown  to  be  a  decision  based  upon  a
        material misdirection of the law or to be irrational or outside the
        range of permissible decisions.


Decision
