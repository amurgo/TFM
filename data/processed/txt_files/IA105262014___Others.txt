Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr A Jafar, Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Turkey born on 7 November 1983,  6  July
    1992 and 29 July 2013 respectively and are a family. References to "the
    appellant" are to Mr Demirok as the other appellants' appeals falls  or
    rests on that of the first appellant.  The  appellant  appeals  to  the
    Upper Tribunal against the determination of First-tier Judge Cresswell,
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the respondent  dated  13
    February 2014 to refuse the appellant leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom under the European Community Accession  Agreement  (hereinafter
    "the Ankara Agreement") pursuant to paragraph 21 of HC 510.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin
    who stated that the grounds disclose arguable errors in  assessment  of
    the evidence and hence the law.

 3. The first-tier Tribunal Judge Cresswell found  the  following  which  I
    summarise.

       . "The appellant produced a battery of papers for the appeal hearing,
         in the form of two bundles and further tax papers submitted. As the
         case  guidance  makes  clear,   the   test   is   qualitative   not
         quantitative. It was the position  of  the  Home  Office  that  the
         documents were effectively a  sham  i.e.  that  the  appellant  had
         produced documentation which included invoices and  bank  statement
         and  payment  of  self-employed  National   Insurance   and   self-
         Assessment taxation, to hide the fact that he was actually  working
         in some other capacity. Having assessed all  the  evidence  in  the
         round, the position taken by the respondent was more than likely  a
         correct one and that the appellant has failed to show that he meets
         the requirements of rule 21 with the consequence that the other two
         appellants cannot meet rule 21." [15 (iii)]


       . "I found the evidence given by the appellant to be  wholly  lacking
         in credibility. In fact so poor  was  his  grasp  of  what  he  was
         pretending that his business comprised of that at times  it  became
         quite awkward. Mr Howells pursued the point that, despite producing
         vast quantities of paper, there was not a  single  piece  of  paper
         demonstrating the appellant's work. Indeed there was no  flyers  or
         other forms of  advertising  or  CVs  produced  business  plans  et
         cetera." [15 (iv)]


       . The appellant appeared incapable of detailing some aspects  of  his
         claimed business. For instance, Mr  Howells  asked  him  about  his
         involvement in training and suggested to the appellant that he does
         a lot of training, to which he replied "not just training, business
         consultancy". When he was then asked about the  media  he  used  in
         training, he  eventually  said  that  the  training  was  not  that
         difficult "I don't teach them anything". [15 (vi)]


       . The appellant told me that he advises people looking to  travel  to
         the UK for business study to find accommodation or courses and also
         offers a "meet and greet" service at the airport service.  He  said
         that the other side was developing business, Kebab or coffee shops,
         who want to expound their business and advice on how to  expand.  I
         asked him how I would find him from Turkey and he told me  that  he
         has an Internet site and  that  he  advertises  in  newspapers  but
         generally relies on  word-of-mouth.  There  being  no  evidence  of
         newspaper advertising in the bundle, and the appellant  not  having
         called any of his clients to support his case orally,  I  suggested
         that we look at his website in the  course  of  the  hearing  which
         brought the response "my website has been frozen for the last year.
         Things have been uncertain and I didn't have  a  passport  for  the
         last year". [15 (vii)]


       . "Mr Howells asked the appellant  what  are  the  main  parts  of  a
         business plan, to  which  he  replied  "market  research,  business
         development, business adviser". Mr Howells put it to the  appellant
         that he did not know anything about business plans but he said that
         he did. When he was asked what business plan  would  look  like  he
         said: "I don't do business plans". I find this very strange because
         a lot of the invoices referred previously to that form of work. The
         appellant then gave a sketchy and limited description of  the  main
         sections of a CV might be. Eventually the appellant said during re-
         examination that the description he placed on invoices of his  work
         was simply  words  he  had  used  when  he  made  the  first  these
         application and "nobody said anything". This was shortly  after  he
         had told Mr Jaffar in relation to a specific  invoice,  when  asked
         what he did to earn the money, "business plan reparation". If there
         was a legitimate business, surely a client must have  wondered  why
         he was being charged for a business plan when there was no business
         plan at all, to take just one example of the work  descriptions  on
         the invoices." [15 (ix)]


       . "during re-examination Mr Jafar asked the appellant about  business
         planning. The appellant set out an account of his assistance  to  a
         person interested in setting up a textile business in  the  UK  and
         the business planning and marketing analysis he  had  conducted  on
         his behalf, which consisted of finding clothes shops in Bournemouth
         town centre and shopping centre and asking store  holders  of  what
         sold better, baby clothes or toddler clothes, all for the  princely
         charge of ï¿½55 because the client was a friend. The  appellant  told
         me that he had not worked much longer than an hour on this project.
         I found the whole explanation of how this invoice  had  come  about
         completely incredible." [15 (ix)]


       . "the appellant then moved on to another equally incredible tale  of
         the assistance he had given to London kebab who had asked  him  how
         they could earn more money. He had advised them to relocate  or  to
         change decoration or use updated technology  and  to  seek  cheaper
         products to buy. The appellant had significant  difficulty  telling
         the tribunal the best place  to  locate  a  kebab  shop  and  other
         factors that would need to be considered such as planning.  He  was
         asked about the IT aspect and it was clear that he had no  idea  at
         all about relevant technology because when he  was  asked  for  the
         name of the system which would bring up  the  name  of  a  previous
         telephone caller, he said that the system did not have  a  specific
         name. He told me that there is only one system  and  it  is  called
         "telephone technology system" then "technological delivery system",
         and that it is produced by a friend of his "you get in  touch  with
         him and he set it up for you" the proliferation of such systems  in
         everyday life, a simple adaptation  of  caller  identity  makes  it
         unlikely indeed that the appellant's friend is the only one able to
         install it. When asked why the owner of Lounge Kebab could not make
         his own assessment of where a shop should be  better  located,  the
         appellant said that he was working very long  hours  and  would  be
         unable to do so because he was so busy, which rather put the lie to
         his need to do so in the first place". [15 (x)]


       . Although there was a lot of documentation the judge said there does
         not seem to payment by claimed businesses other than in cash  which
         appears somewhat unusual. "The invoices provided by  the  appellant
         appeared to be  often  contemporaneous  with  the  raising  of  the
         invoice which conflicts with what I  have  read  in  newspapers  of
         providers of services having to chase  clients  for  payment".  The
         Judge noted that there was no form of schedule correlating invoices
         and payments. He said that only one payment other than by cash  was
         proffered to a name on the invoice and was  identified  during  the
         course of the hearing. The Judge gave Mr Jaffar and opportunity  of
         15 to 20  minutes  to  have  further  look  at  invoices  and  bank
         statement and whether he and the appellant could find  any  further
         payments by means other than cash which could be attributable to an
         invoices in the bundle. The judge noted that  after  the  exercise,
         the manuscript sheet set out 10 bank entries which  correlate  with
         invoices. Having looked at the identified payments the  judge  said
         they do not provide support suggested by  their  inclusion  in  the
         manuscript list. The Judge said that the appellant has not told him
         the truth about the payments of 3 July 2012 that he paid  into  his
         account at Lloyds Bank Eastleigh. The Judge  considered  the  other
         evidence provided by the appellant such as letters and  noted  that
         there was a lack of specificity in these letters and that there was
         a certain similarity about the styles  and  content  of  them,  for
         which coincidence could be an explanation. He noted that no clients
         attended the hearing to support the appellant.


       . The Judge concluded that having looked at the evidence in the round
         he is driven to the conclusion that the appellant  has  produced  a
         paper trail which does not coincide with what actually occurred. He
         stated "it looked very much to me  as  though  someone  had  simply
         looked at payments made into the appellant's bank account and  then
         produce invoices to match them so as to pretend that  the  payments
         into the bank were payments of those  invoices.  I  have  concluded
         that the appellant does not  have  a  genuine  business  generating
         income to support him and his family. I have concluded that he must
         be earning money from some form of  employment  so  as  to  support
         himself and his family.


 4.  The  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  state  the  following  which  I
    summarise. The respondent's case was  essentially  developed  in  cross
    examination. The First-tier Tribunal's findings are at paragraph 15 and
    his conclusion that the payments into a bank account over the two years
    is really one from employment as opposed  to  self-employment.  However
    the deposits show that in no one-week or month  are  the  same  as  the
    account shows extremely erratic deposits of different amounts at wildly
    different  frequencies.  This  is  perverse,  the  whole  point   about
    employment is that there is a  contract  for  consistent  provision  of
    services at a fixed rate of pay-that is spotted simply do not  evidence
    that. Rather the judge failed to consider that the very details of  the
    deposits were commensurate with self-employment. The Judge rejected the
    appellant's explanation that the three amounts paid  in  one  day  were
    arbitrarily deposited from dividing one lump sum in favour of the  fact
    that the deposits were in fact like this because they represented three
    different invoice amounts and each deposit was for  the  payment  of  a
    different invoice. Thus the judge's reasoning and finding at  (xvi)  is
    in complete contradiction to (xx). The appellant provided invoices  for
    one year which totalled almost 100 pages. The appellant explained  that
    he did this to show as a sample because it should  be  remembered  that
    the respondent did not in their refusal originally make any  allegation
    that suspicion arose from the invoices or bank statements  before  her.
    The  judge  failed  to  consider  the  appellant  second  bundle  which
    contained up to date back statements which  were  corroborated  by  the
    pattern of deposits commensurate with self-employment business.

 5. The Judge did  not  explain  why  he  found  the  appellant's  evidence
    incredible without  explaining  why  it  is  incredible.  In  Charuruka
    (13729) the Tribunal stated  that  if  an  adjudicator  is  to  express
    complete disbelief in the appellant's story it is for  the  adjudicator
    to state why this is so and not to rely on a generalised description of
    the evidence particularly  when  it  is  certainly  arguable  that  the
    description was for example vague and inconsistent would not  stand  up
    to scrutiny. It is submitted that each error  identified  in  itself  a
    sufficient to be a material error of law, even if other  reasons  given
    are sustainable, this is because the Judge makes clear that the overall
    conclusion of adverse credibility is gleaned through the  consideration
    of all the points in the round.

 6. I heard submissions from both parties at the hearing the full notes  of
    which are in my record of proceedings.

    Findings and Discussion


 7. I have considered the determination, the  grounds  of  appeal  and  the
    parties' submissions in my assessment whether there is a material error
    of law in the determination of Judge  Creswell.  The  permission  Judge
    merely stated that "the grounds disclose arguable errors in  assessment
    of the evidence and hence the law".

 8. On my own evaluation of the determination I find that the points raised
    by the appellant in his grounds of appeal are a mere quarrel  with  the
    findings of the Judge which he made based on the  evidence  before  him
    which included the appellant's oral evidence. The grounds of appeal  do
    not mention oral evidence which was before the Judge but simply  relied
    on the documentary evidence provided and which was of great quantity as
    noted by the Judge in his determination.

 9. The  judge  has  given  detailed  consideration  to  all  the  evidence
    including the documentary evidence at paragraph 15 of his determination
    as set out above and which I will not repeat as it is self-explanatory.



10.  The  Judge  found  that  the  appellant's  oral  evidence  lacked  all
    credibility and gave full and cogent  reasons  for  his  findings.  The
    Judge said that the appellant had very little knowledge of his business
    from which he claims to make a profit. It was open to the judge to find
    that  the  appellant's  lack  of  knowledge  about  his  business   and
    businesses generally was not consistent with the  appellant's  evidence
    that he is in business in this country. These are sustainable  findings
    by the Judge on the evidence before him.

11. The Judge also considered the documentary evidence in detail as set out
    at paragraph 15 and came up with many examples for why the  documentary
    evidence was  not  credible.  He  found  that  the  invoices  and  bank
    statements looked very much to him as though someone had simply  looked
    at payments made into the appellant's bank account  and  then  produced
    invoices to match them so as to pretend that the payments into the bank
    were payments of those invoices. The appellant  is  simply  relying  on
    copious documentation that he produced which the judge found not to  be
    qualitative  but  only  quantitative  and  stated  that  the  appellant
    provided vast quantities of paper, but there was not a single piece  of
    paper demonstrating the appellant's work. The judge also found that not
    one client attended the hearing to support the appellant's  claim  that
    he is in business. These are all sustainable findings on the evidence.

12. The Judge also found that the appellant provided  no  flyers  or  other
    forms of advertising or CVs produced, business plans et cetera. At  the
    hearing the Judge asked the appellant to show him his business website,
    the appellant said that it has not been  operational  for  a  year  and
    admitted there was no website.  The  Judge  in  the  circumstances  was
    entitled to make the finding that the  appellant  is  not  telling  the
    truth about whether he is in business. The Judge was entitled  to  find
    on the evidence that the appellant is working in this country and  does
    not have a business from which he earns a profit.

13. On the grounds of appeal it is stated that the appellant has  deposited
    different amounts of money at different times into his bank account and
    that is indicative of self-employment. The Judge  found  otherwise  and
    gave good reasons for his findings.

14. The Judge found that the appellant has created this fiction that he  is
    in business to circumvent the Immigration Rules and  pretend  that  has
    established business in the United Kingdom but  is  obviously  working.
    The Judge was entitled to come to the conclusions that he  did  on  the
    evidence  before  him  both  oral  and  documentary  and  there  is  no
    perversity in his findings.

15. The appellant has not demonstrated that the Judge  fell  into  material
    error in his evaluation of all the evidence.

16. It necessarily follows from that the appellants appeal are dismissed.
