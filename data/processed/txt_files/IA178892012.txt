Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr O Shibli, instructed by North Kensington Law
Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr Sartorius, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a Jamaican citizen born on in 1994, who reached the  age
    of majority therefore on 8 August 2012 appeals with permission  against
    the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones QC,  given
    on 14  September 2012 dismissing his appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision on 10th August 2012 to refuse  him  further  leave  to  remain
    outside the Immigration Rules on human rights grounds, with  particular
    reference to Article 8 ECHR (private and family life).

 2. On 23 May 2012 the appellant had been served with form IS151A informing
    him  of  his  status  as  an  illegal  entrant  or  person  subject  to
    administrative removal under Section 10 of the Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 1999 and on 10th August 2012 he was notified that  a  decision  had
    been taken to remove him.  The decision under appeal is not a  decision
    to make a deportation order.

Factual Matrix

 3. The appellant came to the United  Kingdom  in  2000,  accompanying  his
    father and younger sister.  The appellant was six, and his sister  four
    years old.  The appellant only ever had six months' leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a visitor, from 28 May 2000 to 27 October  2000.
    He has been in the United Kingdom illegally as an overstayer since that
    time.  The appellant's biological mother remained in Jamaica.  There is
    some evidence that she married in Canada last year, but at the hearing,
    the appellant stated that she still lives  in  Jamaica.   There  is  no
    recent evidence from the appellant's mother before me.

 4. On 2 October  2002,  his  father  was  convicted  of  manslaughter  and
    conspiracy  to  rob,  sentenced  to  eight  years'  imprisonment,   and
    recommended for deportation.   He  remained  in  prison  until  he  was
    deported in June 2008.  He is said to have subsequently died in Jamaica
    in July 2012.

 5. On 10 March 2006, the respondent served notice of decision  to  make  a
    deportation order in relation to the appellant and his sister, in  line
    with the deportation of their father, who  was  removed  in  2008:  the
    appellant  challenged  it  unsuccessfully   through   the   Immigration
    Tribunals but the deportation was not proceeded with on the  advice  of
    Hackney Social Services, who carried out an assessment  in  June  2008.
    Further decisions not to deport the appellant were  also  taken  on  17
    January 2011, on the basis of criminal convictions, and  in  May  2012,
    following further convictions.

 6. On 6 August 2008, the appellant applied to remain in the United Kingdom
    on Article 8 grounds; that application  was  rejected  on  10  December
    2008.  There does not appear to have been an appeal.  The appellant was
    then 14 years old.

 7. It appears that the woman  who  has  acted  as  a  step-mother  to  the
    appellant and his sister, and who he regards as his mother, came to the
    United Kingdom shortly before he did and that she began caring for  the
    appellant at  that  time.   His  step-mother  attempted  to  adopt  the
    appellant and his sister, unsuccessfully,  and  on  31  May  2010,  she
    applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom, with  the  appellant
    as a dependant.  That application was also unsuccessful.

 8. The appellant's criminal history began in 2010 when  he  was  16  years
    old.  The family was mostly supported  by  his  step-mother's  extended
    family and friends: their housing circumstances  were  very  difficult,
    but on legal advice his step-mother was not working.  The  family  were
    awaiting being able to apply for discretionary leave  pursuant  to  the
    "seven year rule" which then applied to children.

 9. Over the next couple of years, the  family  moved  from  one  house  to
    another because they had no settled home.  The appellant  felt  awkward
    and unwanted and spent a lot of time on the streets; he became involved
    with the Beaumont Gang in Hackney and wore  their  gang  colours.   His
    education was not proceeding well, partly because he is  dyslexic.  The
    family moved to Leyton, then  back  to  the  Hackney  area,  but  their
    domestic circumstances continued to deteriorate.  The appellant in  his
    statement says that he would hang out at the Walthamstow Bus Garage  or
    walking around the Westfield Shopping Mall nearby and  when  approached
    by police would sometimes say cheekily "I am  looking  for  someone  to
    rob".  He knew his friends were "a little bit  bad".   He  was  friends
    with one young man in particular, whom he  knew  to  be  a  thief,  but
    considered relatively harmless.

10. By the time the family had been back in Hackney for a short period, the
    appellant had stopped spending any  significant  time  at  the  various
    addresses where his step-mother and sister  lived.   They  were  moving
    every couple of months, staying with people who  were  kind  enough  to
    permit it.  Their hosts were unwilling to take the appellant in because
    he was no longer considered a child, and they  preferred  to  help  the
    female members of the family  unit.   On  at  least  one  occasion  his
    presence in places where his mother and sister were living  had  caused
    them to have to move on.  His original friends would  no  longer  allow
    the appellant to go to their houses either.

11. The appellant's step-mother and sister moved to  Enfield  to  make  yet
    another fresh start, living in very crowded accommodation with no  room
    for him.  The appellant would stay outside the house,  eating  a  cheap
    "chicken and chips" box meal and being with his friends.  He carried  a
    knife.   On another occasion he carried a hammer 'in order  to  prevent
    trouble'.  The appellant was out very  late  at  night.   He  got  into
    fights.   For between six months and a year it was easier  for  him  to
    hang out with the gang than to go home.

12. When preparing his statement in June 2012, the appellant said  that  he
    did not wish to go to Jamaica because his biological mother and  father
    out there were not hardworking but  were  "useless  and  wasters".   He
    loved them, but he did not respect them.  He  wanted  to  stay  in  the
    United Kingdom and support his sister in  her  footballing  career  and
    perhaps undertake an apprenticeship as a carpenter.  He  asserted  that
    there was no risk of his committing further offences.

Social work and police evidence

13. The evidence which emerges from the social worker at Young Hackney  and
    the police officer who reported on  the  appellant's  criminal  history
    supports some of the factual matters  set  out  in  his  statement  but
    paints a rather darker picture.  Full details are set out in Appendix A
    to this determination.

14. The police records show that in the four years between 23 January  2008
    and 10 January 2012, the appellant was a self-proclaimed  gang  nominal
    linked to the Beaumont Crew and the Balance/Kingshold  gangs.   He  was
    stopped on 38 occasions, five of them near Walthamstow Bus Station.  He
    repeatedly breached both his Youth Rehabilitation Orders (YRO) and  his
    Detention and Training Orders (DTO).  On at least two  occasions,  when
    stopped, he stated that he was 'waiting to rob someone'.

First-tier Tribunal determination

15. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the materials before  him  and
    dismissed the appeal, on the basis that the appellant remaining in  the
    United Kingdom was not conducive to the  public  good,  and  that  such
    family and/or private life as he enjoyed with his step-mother, who  had
    brought him up, and with his 16-year-old sister, was not sufficient  to
    make his removal disproportionate.

Permission to appeal

16. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Chalkley  on
    the basis that he considered it properly arguable that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge might have erred in law by failing not only to refer  to
    but to follow and properly apply the decision of the European Court  of
    Human Rights in Maslov v Austria [2008] ECHR (GC) 1638/03  and  in  the
    weight given to some of the  matters  in  a  statement  from  Detective
    Constable  Fraser  which  dealt  with  the   appellant's   history   of
    criminality.

Rule 24 Reply

17. The material paragraphs of the Reply were as follows:

          "... 4. The relationship between the appellant and his sister  was
                fully assessed, it was not necessary for the judge to  refer
                to Section 55 [of the 2009 Act], it is  clear  from  reading
                the determination that he did look at the best interests.

                 5.    The  grounds  do  not  demonstrate  that  there  were
                substantial matters of disagreement between the  appellant's
                statement and the one from the police that the judge  placed
                some weight on.  There was ample evidence of the appellant's
                links to gang violence from the  documents  the  judge  took
                note of  including  the  information  from  the  appellant's
                supervising officer.

            Proportionality was considered in light of all these matters and
                the appellant's private life was in the main  based  on  his
                links to gangs."

Error of Law

18. At the beginning of the hearing I heard submissions on error of law.  I
    am satisfied that having regard to  the  failure  to  refer  either  to
    Section 55 or to Maslov and the failure to distinguish the weight to be
    given to convictions and other offences with  which the  appellant  was
    said to have been involved, that the First-tier Tribunal  determination
    contains a material error of law and the determination must be  remade.





Substantive Consideration

19. I heard submissions in relation to the proper disposal of the appeal by
    way of remaking it in the Upper Tribunal.

Submissions for the Secretary of State

20. Mr Sartorius observed that the appellant was  a  prolific  offender  as
    mentioned in the Youth Offending Team report.  The appellant sought  to
    lessen his involvement in the incidents, which had  not  been  disputed
    previously.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge had been entitled  to  doubt
    his account  in  this  respect  and  the  Tribunal  should  uphold  the
    determination made.

Appellant's skeleton argument

21.  Mr Shibli's skeleton argument set out the issues: first, whether there
    was an error of law in the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  second,  whether
    removal of the appellant would be a disproportionate interference  with
    his Article 8 ECHR rights to private and family life.  He set  out  the
    history, including a statement by the appellant's  father  and  natural
    mother on 8 June 2011 'granting...parental rights and  custody  of  the
    appellant and his sister' to their  step-mother.  There  are  no  legal
    proceedings to that effect.

22. Mr Shibli contended that the First-tier Tribunal  determination  failed
    to deal with the best interests of the appellant's sister, now  sixteen
    years old.  He set out the  applicable  authorities  and  international
    materials.  The arguments relating to her interests begin at  paragraph
    27 on page 7 of the skeleton argument.   He noted that  the  judge  did
    not record that she had given oral evidence and set out her evidence of
    the death of their father, their not knowing their natural mother,  the
    unstable housing situation caused by their being in the United  Kingdom
    illegally (until recently - the appellant's step-mother and sister  now
    have  discretionary  leave  until  2015)  and  their  unusual   sibling
    closeness, due to the difficult circumstances in which they  had  grown
    up.  Those are the factors which  the  appellant  considers  should  be
    weighed in relation to his sister's best interests.

23. From paragraph  29,  Mr  Shibli's  skeleton  argument  dealt  with  the
    evidence of Detective Constable Fraser who summarised  the  appellant's
    criminal history. He set out the disputed elements of that history.  He
    noted that the evidence was hearsay and, following  Bah  (EO(Turkey)  -
    liability to deport) [2012] UKUT 00196 (IAC), the reduced weight to  be
    given to hearsay evidence. The First-tier Tribunal had speculated about
    the reason why so many  cases  had  not  proceeded  to  court,  or  had
    collapsed at court.  The judge had in effect treated the appellant as a
    person with more convictions than he actually had.

24. The skeleton argument next dealt  with  Maslov  v.  Austria  -  1638/03
    [2008] ECHR 546.  The judge had taken into account the appellant's long
    residence in the United Kingdom, from the age of 6-18 years at the date
    of hearing and that he knew comparatively little of life in Jamaica  in
    consequence.  The appellant would contend that no weight had apparently
    been given to his having committed the offences as  a  minor  and  that
    inadequate weight had been given to his long residence.   His  previous
    convictions were less serious than  those  of  Maslov.   He  relied  on
    comments at paragraph 84 of Maslov, that  there  was  little  room  for
    justifying  expulsion  on  account  of  mostly-non   violent   offences
    committed when a minor. Aggravated rape  and  homicide  were  given  as
    instances when  expulsion  was  justified.    The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's determination lacked anxious scrutiny in this respect.

25. At paragraphs 52-59 of the skeleton argument, Mr  Shibli  set  out  his
    arguments on the appellant's housing difficulty and the  evidence  from
    his step-mother and  sister.   The  appellant  was  not  welcome,  once
    visibly no longer a child, at the addresses where his female  relatives
    were living.  He would not have been prepared to  live  there,  anyway,
    because of his disgust at the conditions  in  which  they  lived:   one
    place was a two bedroom  flat  with  loud  music,  a  hard  drug  using
    husband, a pregnant wife, and people coming and  going  at  all  hours,
    more like a club than a home;  another was full of drug addicts and the
    family would wake up to credit cards with white powder  and  rolled  up
    banknotes all over the place; a third was a house where they had  their
    own rooms but nothing was working, no hot water, no cooker, nothing  at
    all.

26. The step-mother and  sister  no  longer  lived  in  Hackney  where  the
    appellant had committed his offences.  They now lived in Enfield.   The
    Young Hackney and Enfield Youth Offending Team had put together a  plan
    which involved excluding the appellant from Hackney, supervision by the
    Enfield Youth Offending Team, working on his  offending  behaviour  and
    offering education, training and employment opportunities.

27. The respondent had decided not to pursue a  deportation  order  in  May
    2012, following the appellant's most recent conviction.  It was unclear
    why administrative removal was now considered proportionate  since  the
    appellant had committed no further offences  nor  had  any  allegations
    been   made   against   him.     His   removal   would   constitute   a
    disproportionate breach of the  appellant's  private  and  family  life
    under Article 8 ECHR, as well as that of his sister and step-mother.

Submissions for the appellant

28. At the hearing, Mr Shibli accepted that in the light of the decision in
    D v Secretary of State of the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ  39,  the
    decision in JO (Uganda) could not now be  relied  upon,  but  indicated
    that otherwise he would rely on the case law set out  in  the  skeleton
    argument.   The appellant was now an adult, having reached the  age  of
    majority in August 2012.  The decision to remove him had been taken two
    days after he reached  18  years  old.   He  had  never  been  lawfully
    resident in the United Kingdom.

29. All the offences now under consideration were  committed  when  he  was
    between the ages of 16 and 18 and  the  appellant  had  not  spent,  in
    total, more than 10 months  in  detention.   The  police  evidence  was
    hearsay,  and  in  many  cases,  double  hearsay,  since  many  of  the
    allegations  had  not  resulted  in  convictions  and  often   not   in
    prosecutions.  It was difficult for the appellant  to  challenge  those
    allegations.   The appellant disputed many of them.

30. The appellant's father had been shot dead in Jamaica in July 2012.  His
    mother was in Canada.  His step-mother was the only parent he had known
    since his father was arrested and later deported to Jamaica,  when  the
    appellant was five years old.   She  and  the  appellant's  sister  had
    discretionary leave until 2015, when the appellant's sister would be 18
    years old.   They were his family and he  had  continued  to  see  them
    regularly, even when they were sleeping on friends' floors.

31. Mr Shibli accepted that the appellant's  family  life  with  his  step-
    mother and sister was limited; they had not lived in the same household
    for many years now, but he  clearly  had  some  family  life  with  his
    sister.  The position with his step-mother was more tenuous.   He asked
    me to consider the appellant's witness statement at paragraph 3 and  45
    in particular, and that of his step-mother, in particular paragraphs 46-
    48 thereof.  The best interests of his  sister  were  set  out  in  her
    witness statement.  The appellant was the only male family  member  for
    his sister, since his father's death in 2012.

32. There had been a number of decisions by the respondent  not  to  deport
    the appellant, the  last  being  in  May  2012,  when  he  had  already
    accumulated most of his offending history.  There was no explanation as
    to what had changed in the meantime, except that the appellant was  now
    over 18 years old.

33. The appellant and his social worker had explained the reasons  for  his
    offending.  He had spent a lot of time on  the  street,  or  living  in
    other people's  houses,  because  of  the  family's  difficult  housing
    circumstances.  There was no reason to doubt the evidence of his  step-
    mother and sister about the dire family circumstances in  those  times.
    The situation was  very  different  now  and  the  risk  was  lower  in
    consequence.   Hackney  Youth  would  help  him  adjust,  despite   his
    exclusion from the Hackney geographical area.

34. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Discussion

35. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  did  not  address  the  Article  8  ECHR
    provisions within the Immigration Rules after July 2012.  Neither party
    sought to argue that on the facts here,  those  Rules  could  determine
    this appeal in the appellant's favour.  The three areas which have been
    identified as requiring remaking are the sister's best interests  under
    s.55  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009,  the   Maslov
    assessment, and the weight to be given to the police evidence  obtained
    under the monitoring process triggered by the appellant's status  as  a
    gang nominal in Hackney.

The police evidence

36. I approach the question of the police evidence first.  At paragraph  27
    of the determination, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  referred  to  DC
    Fraser's witness statement as to the appellant's criminal offending  as
    'substantially   unchallenged'.    What   the    First-tier    Tribunal
    determination said was this:

           "27.    Unusually,   the   respondent   adduced   evidence.    A
           substantially  unchallenged  witness  statement  from  Detective
           Constable Fraser, dated 23 May 2012, is in evidence.  It details
           the appellant's unenviable criminal history and convictions.

           28.   The Detective Constable details that his  statement  deals
           with  the  appellant's  offending  history,  profile,   criminal
           behaviour and associates.  He says  that  information  has  also
           been  obtained  from  other  police  systems  relating  to   the
           appellant's known associates and his links to gangs.  He goes on
           to say that intelligence reports support a  view  taken  by  the
           police that the appellant's presence in the  United  Kingdom  is
           not conducive to the public good.  The Detective Constable  says
           that during his interaction with the police, the  appellant  has
           provided a total of eight different addresses over  a  four-year
           period.  One of them is identical to an address provided by  the
           appellant to the  United  Kingdom  Border  Agency  which  has  a
           further seven addresses on file for the appellant over a similar
           four-year period.

           29.   The Detective Constable's witness  statement  details  ten
           incidents,  albeit  that  not  each  of  them  resulted   in   a
           conviction.  The incidents that did not  result  in  convictions
           are nonetheless relevant  and  I  can  take  them  into  account
           because the happening of  the  incidents,  as  set  out  in  the
           evidence of the Detective Constable, has not been challenged  or
           disputed. ...

           50.   A full reading of the witness evidence from the  Detective
           Constable leaves me in no doubt whatsoever that the appellant is
           a youth of well-established criminal propensity with  sufficient
           guile to know, when arrested, how to avoid his culpability being
           detected to a sufficient degree to allow convictions to  follow.
           He is a thoroughly undesirable individual who has decided that a
           criminal lifestyle is for him and that he  can  choose  his  own
           rules by which to live, even if they involve inflicting  serious
           harm upon others.  It cannot be conducive  to  the  public  good
           that he remains resident in this country.  Indeed  it  would  be
           entirely conducive to the public  good  if  he  is  required  to
           depart."

37. The list of incidents runs to three pages of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination,  between  paragraphs  30-49.   The  appellant's  witness
    statement of  12  June  2012  comments  on  nine  of  the  23  recorded
    incidents:

           (2)  Arson with intent to endanger life (November 2008).  The 14-
           year old appellant was said to have thrown  a  firework  into  a
           storage room at a block of flats and was charged with arson with
           intent to endanger  life,  the  prosecution  subsequently  being
           withdrawn at court, the appellant now says that:

                 "I got caught up in a suggestion that it would  be  fun  to
                 set some rubbish on fire  [on bonfire  night],  we  thought
                 that it would be our own bonfire without needing to collect
                 wood and that is about as far as the thinking went  between
                 us.  None of us had it in  our  contemplation  that  anyone
                 could get hurt from this at all."

           An elderly lady is said  to  have  been  hospitalised  with  the
           effects of smoke inhalation and later died.

           (3)    Robbery (August 2009).  By now age 15, the  appellant  is
           said to have robbed a 10 year old schoolboy of a  �10  note  and
           run off. The appellant says it had nothing to do  with  him  and
           was a case of mistaken identity.  The police  report  says  that
           the parents did not pursue the case because they did not want to
           traumatise the victim child.

           (11) Racially Aggravated Section 4 (October 2010). The appellant
           and another boy called two white females 'white trash'  and  one
           of them is said to have pulled out a knife.  The appellant  gave
           a 'no comment' interview and the case was discontinued at court.
             The appellant says that the women were 'dirty crack and heroin
           addicts' and known to the  police;  that  the  incident  was  in
           Hackney not Dalston, and that there was no knife.

           (12)  Robbery, Driving Offences (December 2010).  The  appellant
           admitted asking some kids who were playing with a moped  to  let
           him have a little go, before he went to escort his  mother  home
           from one side of the estate to the  other.   The  police  report
           says that he was one of a group  of  youths  who  intimidated  a
           Pizza Hut delivery rider into handing over his pizza  and  moped
           and that he was  arrested  two  days  later.   He  was  charged,
           convicted, and given a 4-month DTO.

           (13)  Possession of Offensive Weapon, Assault  Police  (December
           2010).  The police report says that a group of six males damaged
           a till at Perfect Chicken in E9.  The appellant was found  still
           loitering nearby and pulled an 8 cm lock knife on police  trying
           to pick him up.  He gave a 'no comment' interview,  was  charged
           and convicted and given a  DTO  for  8  months.   The  appellant
           admitted being there but said he was just eating  cheap  chicken
           and chips and leaning on a car.  He had nothing to do  with  it.
           His having a knife  with  him  was  not  a  conscious  decision.
           Members of his mother's family had refused to  accommodate  them
           further and his mother and sister  were  staying  with  friends.
           The appellant was on the streets and had to carry  a  knife,  to
           keep people from approaching him and to stay safe.

           (14)  Possession of Offensive Weapon (June 2011).  The appellant
           was stopped by police when he had a blue handled claw hammer  in
           his waistband.  He stated that he was  carrying  it  because  of
           increased  gang  violence.   He  was  charged,  convicted,   and
           eventually received a 4-month  DTO.   The  appellant's  comments
           accord with those of the police in  that  he  was  carrying  the
           hammer because he felt unsafe.

           (17)  GBH/ABH (December 2011).  The appellant was said  to  have
           had a fight with a member of the Gilpin Square  Boys  Gang,  who
           was stabbed in the shoulder, abdomen and leg.  In his  statement
           he admitted having a fight but not stabbing the other boy.   The
           case was discontinued at court.

           (18)   Violent  Disorder  (December  2011).  The  appellant  was
           arrested after an incident at  Westfield  shopping  centre.   He
           gave a false name when arrested  and  denied  involvement  in  a
           large fight between the Beaumont Gang (whose colours he was said
           to be wearing) and the Young Blood City Gang, in which  'punches
           were thrown and chairs were used as weapons' and a member of the
           opposing gang was stabbed.  He was arrested, gave a  false  name
           and refused  to  give  his  associates'  names.   He  given  the
           sentences  set  out  in  (16)  above.   In  his  statement,  the
           appellant said that this incident occurred when  his  home  life
           was improving and that he was not wearing gang colours.  He  had
           nothing else to say about the incident.

38. There is no comment on the  remaining  incidents.  Each  of  the  above
    incidents  is  supported  by  a  crime  number  and  a  custody  record
    reference. Whilst the information summarised is indeed hearsay,  and  I
    do take account of the appellant's comments, the summary  is  based  on
    information in police and gang nominal records and I have no reason  to
    consider that it is substantially inaccurate.

The best interests of the appellant's sister

39. The appellant's sister is still a child.   She  lives  with  his  step-
    mother and has done so throughout.  His step-mother and sister have not
    visited him during his  last  incarceration  and  his  step-mother  was
    unwilling to serve as a bail address for him in July 2012.

40.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  considered  private  and  family  life   at
    paragraphs 22-26 of the determination.  The  conclusion,  at  paragraph
    26, that although the appellant's sister would very much  like  him  to
    remain in the United Kingdom, there was no evidence before the Tribunal
    that there would be any adverse psychological impact save a  degree  of
    sadness, and that the appellant no longer lives with them, is supported
    by the documents and evidence before me now.

41. There is nothing to indicate that it would not be in the sister's  best
    interests to continue residing separately from her brother and  in  the
    United Kingdom, with their step-mother.   The suggestion that he is the
    only male in the family is negated by the  type  of  man  that  he  has
    become; it is not in the interests of his  sister  to  continue  to  be
    linked with a gang nominal who carries knives and hammers and lives  as
    the appellant has lived.

42. I am satisfied that there is nothing in the s.55 arguments.

The Maslov assessment

43. The Court of Appeal summarised the Maslov test in Peart v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 568 thus:

           "23.  In Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47 the European  Court  of
           Human Rights considered the approach to  be  taken  by  national
           authorities  when  considering  the  deportation  of  a  foreign
           national on the grounds that his presence constitutes  a  danger
           to the community. It was common ground that the effect  of  that
           decision, and of decisions in earlier cases (notably  Boultif  v
           Switzerland (2001) 33 EHRR  1179  and  �ner  v  The  Netherlands
           [2007] INLR 273),  is  that  in  assessing  whether  removal  or
           deportation is proportionate the following factors are  relevant
           (although their weight  will  vary  according  to  the  specific
           circumstances of the case):

                 (i)    the  nature  and  seriousness  of   the   offence(s)
                 committed by the appellant;
                 (ii)  the length of the appellant's stay in the country;
                 (iii)       the period of time that has elapsed  since  the
                 offence was committed and the  appellant's  conduct  during
                 that period;
                 (iv)  the nationalities of the persons concerned;
                 (v)   the appellant's family situation;
                 (vi)  whether any spouse or partner knew about the  offence
                 at the time he or she entered into the relationship;
                 (vii)       whether the appellant has children, and if  so,
                 their ages;
                 (viii)      the seriousness of the difficulties the  spouse
                 or partner is likely to encounter in the country  to  which
                 the appellant is to be removed;
                 (ix)  the best interests and wellbeing of any children;
                 (x)   the strength of the social, cultural and family  ties
                 with the host country and the country to which  removal  is
                 to be made.

           24.   Moreover, as the court pointed out in paragraphs 74 and 75
           of its judgment in Maslov, it is necessary to have regard to the
           age at which the person came to this country and the  extent  to
           which he was brought up and educated here.  In  the  case  of  a
           settled migrant who is lawfully present and has spent the  major
           part of his childhood and youth in  this  country  very  serious
           reasons are required  to  justify  removal.  The  appellant,  of
           course, is not a lawful migrant, because attempts to  regularise
           his immigration status came to nothing and were not subsequently
           pursued, but even in a case where the  person  is  not  lawfully
           present in this country, the fact that he has  been  here  since
           childhood is still a weighty consideration: see  JO  (Uganda)  v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010]  EWCA  Civ  10
           per Richards L.J. at paragraph 31."

44. Sub-paragraphs (vi) and (viii) are not applicable. The appellant has no
    spouse or partner.  His strongest point is the length of  his  stay  in
    the United Kingdom; he has been here since he was six years old and  is
    now 19 years old; that is a 'weighty consideration'.  He is Jamaican as
    are  his  step-mother  and  his  sister.   They   have   been   granted
    discretionary leave but only for another 18 months,  until  his  sister
    reaches 18.  None of the parties is settled.

45. The appellant and his sister assert mutual affection, but they  do  not
    live together and it seems, despite  her  evidence  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that his step-mother no longer wishes him to live  with  her.
    I have dealt with the question of his sister's best interests;  despite
    their mutual regard, resuming  living  with  the  appellant  given  his
    lifestyle is unlikely to  be  in  her  best  interests,  which  lie  in
    continuing to live with their step-mother and grow up as peacefully and
    lawfully as possible.

46. That  leaves  (i)  and  (x)  as  the  determinative  factors.   On  the
    appellant's own case, he has received a total of 10  months'  detention
    for seven convictions dealing with 10 different offences, over  a  four
    year period.  The offences were: attempted  robbery,  possession  of  a
    bladed article, driving offences, violent disorder,  possession  of  an
    offensive weapon, breach of a YRO, and common assault.  I remind myself
    that he is a gang nominal in the  Hackney  area  and  that  he  is  the
    subject of a 12-month geographical ban from Westfield Shopping  Centre.



47. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's description of  the  police  report  as
    'substantially unchallenged' may not  be  entirely  accurate,  but  the
    appellant does not challenge the substance of most  of  the  incidents.
    Even taking into  account  his  comments,  he  emerges  as  a  seasoned
    criminal and self-confessed gang member, which is how he was treated in
    the First-tier Tribunal determination.  It is also clear that  he  was,
    in effect, living on the streets  in  Hackney  and  Dalston  and  that,
    whatever is now said, he is estranged  from  his  step-mother  and  his
    sister, who have not been able to control his offending.

48. The appellant has repeatedly breached his DTO and YRO orders.   I  note
    that the Hackney and Enfield Youth Offending  Teams  consider  that  on
    release, he should be excluded from Hackney and receive help  with  his
    offending behaviour, including education and employment assistance.  It
    is not suggested that he is a reformed criminal about whom there is  no
    further concern.  On the contrary, his ability  and/or  willingness  to
    comply and to change his ways has not been  demonstrated,  although  he
    asserts it.  He is very poorly educated, because of  his  dyslexia  and
    his difficult childhood, and is now homeless, rootless, and immersed in
    gang culture.  His social, cultural  and  family  ties  in  the  United
    Kingdom, other than with London criminal gangs, are very weak.

49. In Jamaica, to which he would be removed, there is also  a  significant
    gang culture.  His mother lived there until recently and there was some
    confusion in the evidence  about  her  present  country  of  residence,
    despite the evidence that she married in Canada last year.  His  father
    was shot last year in Jamaica.  He may well have other relatives  there
    who have not been disclosed.

50. The appellant's last known conviction was in May  2012.   It  is  right
    that no later offences have been disclosed but the  appellant  remained
    detained until at least September 2012.  It is unclear  whether  he  is
    currently in immigration detention or on bail.  His history up  to  and
    including May 2012 suggests that he is likely to return to  criminality
    on his release as does the proposal put  forward  by  the  Hackney  and
    Enfield Youth Offending Teams.

51. I am satisfied, on the evidence  before  me,  that  the  administrative
    removal of this  appellant  to  Jamaica  does  not  breach  the  United
    Kingdom's  international  obligations  under  Article  8  ECHR  and  is
    proportionate.

52.        This        appeal        is        therefore         dismissed.

























Conclusions:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the  decision  and  remake
it by dismissing the appeal.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005.   I  have  not
been asked to make one under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended) and I do not consider  it  appropriate  to
do so.

                                 Appendix A
                       SOCIAL WORK AND POLICE EVIDENCE

53. The appellant is a gang nominal in the Hackney area, that is to say, he
    is on a list maintained by Hackney Council of known gang members  whose
    activities  are  monitored  by  Hackney  Police.   The  social   worker
    recommended that the appellant be excluded from Hackney  and  monitored
    by a different London borough.

54. The social worker at Young Hackney, Mr Myirie, was his  designated  ISS
    officer.  ISS officers are nominated only in relation to the sentencing
    of young people at risk of custody as a result of a serious offence  or
    as a prolific offender: in the appellant's case it seems  that  he  was
    both.  Mr Myirie had only two weeks to work with the  appellant  before
    he reoffended and was again detained.   His  account  is  derived  from
    documents provided in that context and records that the  appellant  was
    sentenced on 14th December 2010 for a driving offence, including being
    re-sentenced for two previous matters, and that  on  that  occasion  he
    received a detention and training order (DTO) for twelve months.

55. On 16 July 2011, while still serving the community element of his  DTO,
    the appellant appeared at Thames Youth Court for possession of a weapon
    and was made the subject of a youth rehabilitation order (YRO) for  two
    years with six months' ISS requirement.   He  breached  the  YRO  on  9
    November  2011,  but  the  DTO  was  permitted  to  continue,  with  an
    additional unpaid work requirement of 40 hours.

56. Between July 2011 and 16 December 2011 the appellant did not  reoffend.



57. On 16 December 2011, the appellant was arrested in connection with  an
    incident in which a young person was assaulted and stabbed, suffering a
    non life threatening injury.   The  appellant  was  carrying  a  bladed
    article and when arrested on 11 January  2012,  he  was  charged  with
    possession of an offensive weapon and grievous  bodily  harm.   He  was
    sentenced to four months DTO for  the  offences  of  possession  of  an
    offensive weapon and the breach of the YRO.

58. A month later, the GBH offence  was  changed  to  common  assault;  the
    appellant was sentenced to another four months' DTO on that count.

59. Meanwhile, in December 2011, he had  committed  a  further  offence  of
    violent disorder and on 4 May 2012, he received a  one  year  YRO  with
    supervision requirement and exclusion requirement due to begin  on  his
    release on 24 May 2012.

60. The statement records that Miss M gave the appellant unconditional love
    and affection, but had been  unable  to  visit  him  in  Feltham  Young
    Offenders Prison because she did  not  have  the  appropriate  identity
    documents.  Miss M, the appellant and his sister were all in the United
    Kingdom unlawfully.  The strength of the family unit was recognised.

61. The appellant's offences took place in a particular gang area in E9  in
    Hackney and in December 2011, he had been added  to  Hackney  Council's
    list of gang  nominals  (persons  mentioned  in  police  interviews  as
    involved in gangs in the area), following which  he  was  monitored  by
    Hackney Police to ensure that he did not commit any  further  offences.
    It was not possible to restrict his movements as to where he resided or
    socialised but, during the short period in which the Young Hackney  ISS
    process was in place, he was made aware that his continued  association
    with other gang nominals in certain areas could increase  the  risk  of
    his reoffending which might result in his being excluded  from  certain
    geographical areas by the court.

62. The report concluded that the appellant had done very well  to  survive
    and  live  as  normal  a  life  as  possible  in  his   dire   personal
    circumstances.  Young Hackney suggested that the  appellant  should  be
    excluded from Hackney and be  supervised  by  Enfield  Youth  Offending
    Team.

                                 APPENDIX B

                               FAMILY EVIDENCE

    1. The Tribunal file contains a declaration made in June  2011  by  the
       appellant's natural parents living in Kingston, Jamaica,  confirming
       that the children were living in England with Miss M with their full
       permission and consent and that Miss M was fully  and  unreservedly
       responsible  for  their  care,  maintenance  and   upbringing.    At
       paragraph 6 they stated "we are satisfied that [Miss M] is providing
       stable and satisfactory living arrangements for our said  children".



    2. However, an email bearing the same date as the deportation  decision
       noted that the appellant was not  residing  with  Miss M,  who  was
       estranged from him and not happy for him  to  use  her  address  for
       bail.

    3. A short statement from the appellant's sister stated  that  she  was
       upset living without him and felt sad and quiet.  By  the  time  she
       made the statement on 13th September 2012 their father had  died  in
       Jamaica and she did not know her birth mother.  Her opinion was that
       the appellant did not know how to be in Jamaica.  She continued:

         "I know he hasn't been around and I have missed him  while  he  has
         been gone but I know that this is just a bad phase that my  brother
         has had to go through because he  spent  so  much  time  alone  and
         outdoors while we were living in places he didn't like to be or was
         unwelcome.  Everything has changed now though now, he can come home
         and we have leave to remain, that means we can  all  live  together
         alone without other dirty people making us feel like a burden,  now
         we can live together with watch the  programmes  that  we  like  to
         watch and eat healthy, my brother will be able to cook and  we  can
         watch movies and football together ([Miss M] likes to watch movies
         so we can watch them together).

         It will be so strange if [he] is not  allowed  to  come  home  just
         because of what he's gone  through.   I  worry  for  him  going  to
         Jamaica, I am scared that they will do to him what they did  to  my
         dad, I am scared that they will expect my brother to be  just  like
         my dad.  [He] is not like anyone  else,  he  is  like  us,  me  and
         [Miss M].  Please just let [him] come home."

    4. A letter from Miss M records the "countless trials  and  struggles"
       that she and these two children faced.  It had not been an easy task
       but she had not shied away from it.  She describes the appellant  as
       a very shy individual, kind-hearted and very selfless.

         "Yes it is a fact that he has been in trouble with the  police  but
         he is not a criminal.  I never meant for [him] to  end  up  in  the
         situation that he is in now and I never  imagined  that  my  family
         would be ripped apart like this.  For years I have pleaded with the
         authorities to allow me to even be able  to  work  to  be  able  to
         provide and protect my kids so to  ensure  that  they  were  always
         comfortable, healthy and living in suitable living  conditions  ...
         my son is a victim my circumstances as they were now I find  myself
         in a better position and all that I ask is that you allow my son to
         come home and let us have this chance as a family and allow  me  to
         make my words true to my kids and show that we are good products of
         society."
