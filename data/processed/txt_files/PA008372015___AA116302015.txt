                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellants appeal against a decision of Judge O R Williams  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 24th February 2016.

 2.  The  Appellants  are  Libyan  citizens.   They  have  three  dependant
    children.

 3. The First Appellant resided in the United Kingdom as a Tier  4  Student
    with a visa valid between 7th June  2014  and  16th  March  2015.   The
    Second Appellant and the children had leave for the same period as  his
    dependants.

 4. The Second Appellant claimed asylum on  19th  February  2015,  and  the
    First Appellant claimed on 4th June 2015.

 5. The applications were refused on 7th August 2015, and the appeals  were
    heard by the FTT on 11th February 2016.  The FTT  heard  evidence  from
    the Appellants and found  them  not  credible,  and  the  appeals  were
    dismissed on all grounds.

 6. The Appellants applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    relying upon five grounds which are summarised below.

Ground 1

 7. The FTT made a material misdirection in law by failing to consider  any
    background country evidence, and  failing  to  engage  with  an  expert
    report prepared by Dr George.

Ground 2

 8. The FTT erred in law by  failing  to  adopt  the  correct  approach  to
    evaluating  the  reliability  of  documentary  evidence.    Dr   George
    commented in his report that although he had only  been  provided  with
    photographs of documents, there was nothing obvious about the documents
    that would cause him to doubt their authenticity.

Ground 3

 9. The FTT made an irrational finding of fact by rejecting a  letter  from
    the local council as it had been drafted upon self-serving  information
    passed on by a relative of the Appellants.  It was  contended  that  in
    oral evidence before the FTT the Appellants confirmed that they had not
    told the council what to write about the damage to  their  property  in
    Libya.

Ground 4

10. The FTT erred by permitting a procedural unfairness.  The  FTT  allowed
    the Respondent's representative at the hearing to  produce  a  document
    indicating that flights to Tobruk Airport were available.  It  had  not
    been suggested in the Respondent's refusal letter that  the  Appellants
    could relocate to Tobruk.  The Appellant's representative  objected  to
    the introduction of this  evidence,  and  contended  that  the  FTT  in
    allowing the evidence to be admitted, caused  a  procedural  unfairness
    which operated to the detriment of the Appellant.





Ground 5

11. The FTT erred in law by applying the wrong standard of proof, by making
    reference to the phrase "reasonably likely."

12. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge J M Holmes who found arguable
    merit in Grounds 1 and 5, and commented that all grounds may be  argued
    "although there appears to be considerably  less  merit  in  the  other
    grounds."

13. Following the grant of  permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  written
    response pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 contending in summary that the FTT had not erred in law.  It
    was not accepted that the FTT had  applied  an  incorrect  standard  of
    proof, and it was contended that the FTT had provided adequate  reasons
    for finding that the witnesses were not consistent and that there  were
    significant discrepancies in their evidence.

14. Directions were issued making provision  for  there  to  be  a  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal to decide whether the FTT decision  contained
    an error of law such that it should be set aside.

Oral Submissions

15. Mr Wood relied and expanded  upon  the  grounds  contained  within  the
    application for permission to appeal.  However Mr Wood did accept  that
    no background evidence had been submitted to the FTT, and therefore  it
    could not be fairly submitted that the FTT  had  erred  by  failing  to
    consider background evidence that was not before it.   In  relation  to
    Ground 1, Mr Wood contended that the FTT had erred by failing to engage
    with Dr George's report, and  failing  to  give  adequate  reasons  for
    rejecting the conclusion reached by Dr George.

16. Mr McVeety pointed out that Dr George had acknowledged  in  his  report
    that his role was not to assess credibility and that had to be  decided
    by the FTT.

17. Mr McVeety submitted that the FTT was entitled to reject  the  evidence
    given by the Appellants, because of inconsistency and  vagueness.   The
    FTT had noted that the First Appellant  had  travelled  back  to  Libya
    which did not indicate that he genuinely felt at risk.

18. In relation to the standard of proof, Mr McVeety  submitted  that  this
    had been correctly set out by the FTT at paragraphs 5  and  7  and  the
    decision did not demonstrate that  the  FTT  had  applied  too  high  a
    standard of proof.  Mr McVeety submitted that the decision  should  not
    be set aside.







19. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

Ground 1

20. As it is now accepted that there was no background  evidence  presented
    to the FTT, I find that the FTT did not  err  in  failing  to  consider
    background evidence.  It is not the function of the FTT  to  carry  out
    research into background evidence after the hearing has concluded.

21. I do not accept that the FTT failed to engage with a report prepared by
    Dr George, in which it is stated that Dr George finds  the  Appellants'
    account plausible.  Dr George at paragraph 113 of his report  correctly
    notes that the determination of credibility is to  be  decided  by  the
    Tribunal.

22. The FTT makes specific reference to Dr George's report at paragraphs 20
    and 27, and at paragraph 20 sets out  part  of  the  report.   The  FTT
    records that the report supports the  credibility  of  the  Appellants'
    account.

23. It is evident from reading the FTT decision that the FTT had regard  to
    the report but was aware that decisions regarding credibility had to be
    made by the FTT and not the expert.  I find that  the  FTT  did  engage
    with the report, and gave sustainable reasons in paragraphs  23-26  for
    not accepting that the Appellants would  be  at  risk  if  returned  to
    Libya.

Ground 2

24. I do not find that the FTT erred in assessment of documentary evidence.
     Dr George  in  his  report  at  paragraph  31  refers  to  photographs
    purporting to  show  the  Appellants'  house  in  Tripoli,  damaged  by
    gunshots, and photographs of a series of documents.  Dr  George  states
    that assessment of the likely authenticity of documents based  only  on
    photocopies can only be provisional, the original  documents  would  be
    needed before confident opinions about document authenticity  could  be
    made.  Dr George comments that there  was  nothing  obvious  about  the
    documents that would cause him to doubt their authenticity.

25. I do not find that the FTT concluded that the photographs could not  be
    relied upon,  and  has  not  made  a  finding  that  documents  proving
    ownership cannot be relied upon.  The FTT  at  paragraph  26  does  not
    dispute that the property shown in the photographs has been damaged  by
    gunfire, but concludes  that  this  was  caused  by  a  random  act  of
    violence, rather than an attack directed at the Appellant.   I  do  not
    find any merit in this ground.





Ground 3

26. It is contended that the FTT made an  irrational  finding  of  fact  in
    considering a letter from the council in Tripoli contained  within  the
    Appellants' bundle at page 90.  This is a translation of a letter which
    confirms that the First Appellant's property was subject  to  an  armed
    attack which resulted in the destruction of  its  contents  and  faï¿½ade
    following the threats that the Second Appellant received "last November
    as a result of a political disagreement with an armed group."  The  FTT
    found at paragraph 26 that this letter had been drafted based upon self-
    serving information passed on by  a  relative  and  therefore  attached
    little weight.

27. In my view it was open to the FTT to reach that  conclusion.   The  FTT
    was not doubting ownership of the property or that there  had  been  an
    attack upon it.  It was open to the FTT to find that the author of  the
    letter, writing on behalf of the city council, received information  on
    behalf of the Appellants that threats had been made in  November  as  a
    result of a political disagreement with an armed group.   That  finding
    was open to the FTT to make and does not disclose a material  error  of
    law.

Ground 4

28. I do not find the FTT erred by permitting a procedural unfairness.  The
    FTT admitted into evidence  a  document  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent at the hearing, indicating that it was  possible  to  obtain
    flights to Tobruk Airport.   This  is  not  material,  as  the  primary
    finding of the FTT at paragraph 32 was that the Appellants could return
    to Tripoli where they  had  lived  the  majority  of  their  lives,  or
    Benghazi.  It is correct that at paragraph 34 the FTT also  found  that
    the Appellants could travel to Tobruk, and it had been no part  of  the
    Respondent's initial refusal that this was possible.

29. The FTT must consider the circumstances appertaining at the date of the
    hearing, and therefore was entitled to consider new evidence.   It  was
    open to the Appellants' representative to apply for an  adjournment  if
    taken by surprise or disadvantage by new evidence.  No such application
    was made.  I do not find that this ground discloses an  error  of  law.



Ground 5

30. In my view it  is  not  helpful  for  the  FTT  to  make  reference  to
    "reasonably likely," as it is not clear, exactly what this means.  What
    is clear, is that when considering an asylum appeal,  the  standard  of
    proof is lower than the normal civil standard which  is  a  balance  of
    probabilities.  An appropriate description could be that  the  standard
    of proof is based upon a reasonable degree of likelihood.

31. Having carefully considered the FTT decision in its totality, I do  not
    find that the FTT applied an inappropriately high  standard  of  proof.
    In my view, the FTT was aware of  the  lower  standard  of  proof  that
    applies in a case such as this, and did not apply a standard  that  was
    higher than a balance of probabilities.

32. My conclusion is that the grounds contained within the application  for
    permission to appeal display disagreement with the findings made by the
    FTT but do not disclose a material error of law.  The FTT made findings
    open to it on the evidence, and provided sustainable reasons for  those
    findings.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the FTT did  not  involve  the  making  of  an
error on a point of law such that the decision must be set aside.  I do  not
set aside the decision.  The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction was made by the FTT.  There has been no  request  for
anonymity made to the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  I  see  no  need  to  make  an
anonymity order.
