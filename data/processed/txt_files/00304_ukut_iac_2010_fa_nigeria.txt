The effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Pankina is not  limited
to the 'three-month rule' in relation to evidence of funds. Policy  Guidance
does  not  have  the  status  of  Immigration  Rules  for  the  purposes  of
immigration appeals.




                            DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The principal appellant is a student at the University of the West  of
      England undertaking an MSc in International  Management.  She  started
      this course on 24 September 2007 and was due to complete it on 2  July
      2010.


   2. The second  appellant  is  her  husband  and  her  dependant  in  this
      application.

   3. On 29 December 2009 the Home Office refused an application made on  or
      about 8 October 2009 for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student
      Migrant under the Points-Based System.  The application  was  refused:
      the points claimed under Appendix C of the Immigration Rules were  not
      awarded because the first appellant had not provided any  evidence  of
      funds.  Under the calculation due under the rules she had  to  provide
      evidence that she had maintenance funds of �2,800.  What  she  had  in
      fact provided in the  application  was  a  number  of  certified  bank
      statements from a Lloyds  TSB  account  in  the  name  of  the  second
      appellant, her husband.


   4. There was ample evidence before the Immigration Judge that  the  first
      appellant had access to the funds in her husband's  bank  account  but
      for cultural reasons chose to  keep  that  account  in  the  husband's
      single name. The evidence to this effect included the contents of  the
      bank statements themselves showing payments out to the  University  of
      the West of England; a statement from the husband that  the  wife  was
      able to access these funds; and a statement from the  university  that
      tuition fees had been in the past been paid by Mr Abidemi Adio.

   5. The Immigration Judge heard  this  appeal  on  22  February  2010  and
      dismissed it on 4 March 2010.  He identified two reasons for doing so:

        (i)  The last date on the bank  statement  was  24  September  2009
        whilst the date of the application was  either  3  October  as  the
        appellant asserted or 8 October  as  the  respondent  asserted  and
        therefore the last entry did not cover the date of the application.




        (ii)  The bank statement  was  in  the  sole  name  of  the  second
        appellant,  the  first  appellant's  husband.   According  to   the
        Guidance issued by UKBA a student may in certain circumstances  use
        the bank statements of his/her parents.  But the Guidance does  not
        permit a student to use the bank statement  of  his/her  spouse  to
        establish his/her case.


              "The fact of the matter is  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
              Guidance require the funds to be available to the  appellant.
              Despite the  fact  that  the  appellant's  husband  may  have
              provided written confirmation that the funds are available to
              her, that consent may be withdrawn at anytime and so it  does
              not assist the appellant in this appeal.  I find  that  funds
              in the  bank  account  of  the  appellant's  spouse  are  not
              available for the appellant".


   6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted  by  the  Vice-
      President on 7 July 2010 in the light of the Court of Appeal  decision
      in Pankina v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 719, dated 23 June.  The appeal  was
      listed before a panel consisting of the President, the  Vice-President
      and SIJ Allen along with other cases concerned with  the  Points-Based
      System and the application of UKBA Guidance on 23 July 2010.


   7. At the end of the hearing we indicated that we would allow the appeal.
       We now give our written  determination  explaining  the  reasons  for
      doing so.

Issue 1: date of the bank statement

   8. The first ground of the IJ's decision can be disposed of shortly.  The
      bank statements that were presented by the  first  appellant  were  in
      fact dated 3 October 2009, as appears from  their  printed  text,  and
      were certified on that date as well.  The rubric at the  head  of  the
      statement says "the personal data on this statement was correct at the
      date of printing".  Whilst it is true that the last transaction on the
      last sheet of the bank statements, a debit of �10  in  favour  of  the
      University of Bristol leaving  a  balance  of  �3,906,  was  dated  24
      September; but the IJ has been misled into thinking that this was  the
      date of the bank statement and that there was a gap between  the  last
      date on the bank statement and the date of application.


   9. There was no such  gap  upon  a  proper  reading  of  that  statement.
      Whether the application was made on 3 or 8 October, the bank statement
      covered the position as of the date of application, since there  would
      inevitably be some gap between the bank statement being  obtained  and
      its arriving in the Home Office for its evaluation.


   Issue 2: use of the bank statement


  10.  That leaves the more important question, namely whether the appellant
      can rely upon her husband's bank account to demonstrate that  she  has
      funds available to her  within  the  meaning  of  Appendix  C  of  the
      Immigration Rules.


  11. Para 11 of  Appendix C of the Immigration Rules as varied on 31  March
      2009 provides:

        "Ten points will only be awarded if the funds shown  in  the  table
        below are available to the applicant and the applicant provides the
        specified documents to show this"

  12.  The first appellant's case is that  she  did  provide  evidence  that
      funds were available to her by reason of specified documents namely  a
      certified bank statement from a an acknowledged financial  institution
      in the United Kingdom.  The  respondent's  case  is  that  the  Policy
      Guidance issued in respect of such claims particularly  paragraph  127
      to 140 requires that apart from "Official Financial Sponsors" the bank
      statement submitted should be in the first appellant's own name or  in
      the name of parents who are eligible as sponsors.


  13. Those are not the requirements of Appendix C or any other part of  the
      Immigration Rules read  independently  of  the  Guidance.   The  first
      appellant further argues that in the light of the  Court  of  Appeal's
      decision  in  Pankina  guidance  cannot  be  used  to  supplement  the
      requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  by  imposing  an  additional
      obligation on applicants that is not spelt out in the Rules.

  14. In the case of Pankina what was in issue was the  requirement  of  the
      Guidance, not spelt out in the Rules themselves, that funds had to  be
      available not merely on the date of  the  application  but  for  three
      months preceding it.

  15. The Court of Appeal first posed the following questions:


        "23.   Counsel,  to  whom  we  are  indebted  for  having  together
        presented an economical and orderly set of documents and arguments,
        have agreed that the questions for the court are these:


                 (1)  Can  the  immigration   rules   lawfully   incorporate
                 provisions set out in another document which


                 (a) has not itself been laid before Parliament


                 (b) is not itself a rule of law but a departmental policy


                 (c) is able to be altered after  the  rule  has  been  laid
                 before      Parliament?


                 (2) If the answer is yes


                 (a) are the facts to be  tested  as  at  the  date  of  the
                 decision or of the appeal?


                 (b) at whatever point the facts are to be  tested,  is  the
                 policy to be applied as a policy or as a rule?


                 (c) in applying it, does ECHR art.8 have any application?


                 (d) If not, does art.8 have any independent application?"

      Later in the judgment it addressed them as follows:
          "28. The reason lies in questions (1)(b)  and  (c).  A  policy  is
          precisely not a rule: it is required by law to be applied  without
          rigidity, and to be used and adapted in the interests of  fairness
          and good sense. To take the  present  case,  the  policy  guidance
          standing alone would not only permit but require a  decision-maker
          to consider whether, say, a week's  dip  below  the  �800  balance
          during the three-month period mattered. This would in turn require
          attention to be given to the object of the  policy,  which  is  to
          gauge, by what is accepted on all sides to  be  a  very  imprecise
          rule of thumb, whether the applicant will be able to support  him-
          or herself without recourse to public funds. If  that  object  was
          sensibly met, the law might well require the policy to be  applied
          with sufficient flexibility to admit the applicant,  or  would  at
          least require consideration to be given to doing so.  But  if  the
          requirement is a rule - and it is the Home Secretary's  case  that
          by incorporation it becomes a rule - then there is  no  discretion
          and no judgment to be exercised.
          29. This in itself would in my  opinion  require  the  three-month
          criterion to form part of the rules laid before Parliament  if  it
          was to be effective. But the objection  goes  deeper.  Albeit  the
          first version of the policy guidance was brought into being within
          the 40 days allowed by s.3(2) for the Parliamentary procedure,  it
          has been open to change at any time. It is this, rather  than  the
          fact that it has in the event been changed, which,  in  answer  to
          question (1)(c), is in my view critical. It means that a  discrete
          element of the rules is placed beyond  Parliament's  scrutiny  and
          left to the unfettered judgment of the rule-maker.
          30. It may be objected that this is  pettifogging:  all  that  the
          three-month provision in the policy guidance is doing  is  firming
          up a requirement in  the  rules.  But  Ms  Giovannetti,  with  her
          customary candour, has  taken  no  such  point.  Instead  she  has
          recognised that, if her argument is sound, it means that the  Home
          Secretary may lawfully lay before Parliament  a  rule  which  says
          simply that graduates may be given leave to remain  in  accordance
          with such policy as the Home  Secretary  may  from  time  to  time
          adopt,  and  that  so  long  as  Parliament  passes  no   negative
          resolution the relevant policies will become rules and, on appeal,
          law. Indeed it can only be in order to insist on such a  principle
          that the Home Secretary did not long ago take the simple  step  of
          amending Appendix C to include the three-month test.
          ...
          33.  ... the operation of the rules qua rules is one  thing;  what
          they contain as a matter of law is another.  In  my  judgment  the
          statutory recognition of rules which are  to  have  the  character
          and, on appeal, the  force  of  law  requires  such  rules  to  be
          certain. That does not shut out extraneous forms  of  evidence  of
          compliance, so long as these are themselves specified, but it does
          in my judgment shut out criteria affecting individuals' status and
          entitlements which - coming back now to the questions in paragraph
          23 above - (a) have not themselves been tendered for parliamentary
          scrutiny, and (c) even if ascertainable at that point of time, may
          be changed without fresh scrutiny. As to (b), while the fact  that
          the criterion absorbed into the rules comes from a policy document
          makes nonsense of the notion of policy, this is not critical:  the
          vice would be the same if the reference in the  rules  were  to  a
          categorical  criterion  in  some  external  but   impermanent   or
          undetermined source."
  16. In the light of this discussion the Court reached  the  conclusion  at
      [37] that the three-month  criterion  formed  no  part  of  the  rules
      applicable to these cases.

  17. Mr. Avery submitted, on instructions, that the decision in Pankina was
      confined to the application of the three-month rule. He was unable  to
      expand on why this should be so in the light of the broader discussion
      leading to the conclusion in the particular case.


  18. We cannot agree.  In our judgment the Court of Appeal was applying the
      answers to the constitutional  questions  it  posed  at  [21]  to  the
      particular  provision  of  the  Policy  Guidance  that  had  led   the
      applicants to fail in their extension  applications.  Although  it  is
      possible that well established practice independent  of  the  proposed
      rule change that is cross-referred to in the rules themselves  may  be
      held to form part of the arrangements established by  the  Rules  that
      Parliament was content should operate, no such submission was advanced
      to us about what the Policy Guidance had to  say  about  the  name  in
      which the bank account needed to be.

  19. We further note that Foskett J concluded that  Pankina  was  of  wider
      application in his judgment in English UK [2010] EWHC 1726 (Admin)  at
      [74] to [77].


   Material error of law


  20. We are therefore satisfied that the IJ made a material error of law in
      both reasons for refusing the appeal. We set aside  the  decision  and
      remake it for ourselves.


   Decision on the appeal

  21.  In our judgment, once it is established that the Policy Guidance does
      not have the status of  the  Immigration  Rules  for  the  purpose  of
      immigration appeals, there is no reason why in a  particular  case  an
      appellant cannot establish that she has funds available to her from  a
      bank account in her husband's name.


  22. There is no question that the funds existed at all material  times  in
      sufficient quantity and that the husband made the funds  available  to
      the wife for the purpose of supporting her during the studies.

  23. This is not even a case of third-party support, as for  many  purposes
      husband and wife  may  be  regard  as  a  single  entity  with  mutual
      obligations. We do not know whether the wife has any claim to  be  the
      legal or equitable owner of the funds in  the  husband's  account.   A
      bank account in joint  names  apparently  suffices  under  the  Policy
      Guidance irrespective of the ability of the  signatories  to  withdraw
      funds for their own purposes or indeed the source of the funds see: PO
      (Points Based scheme; maintenance: loans) Nigeria [2009]  UKAIT  00047
      and AM and SS (PBS - Tier 1 - joint accounts) Pakistan [2010] UKUT 169
      (IAC).

  24.  Here the IJ seems to have accepted  the  explanation  that  the  bank
      account remained in  the  husband's  sole  name  for  purely  cultural
      reasons, even though the husband was dependent on the outcome  of  his
      wife's application to obtain a subordinate ability to reside in the UK
      in accordance with the Rules.


  25.  In our judgment, on the evidence before the IJ and accepted  by  him,
      this appellant was able to demonstrate that she had funds available to
      her from a UK bank account  and this was sufficient for  the  purposes
      of Appendix C. She did not need to go on  to  comply  with  additional
      requirements of the Policy Guidance.

  26. This conclusion is sufficient to allow the appeal.

  27. The IJ did not consider Article 8 and it has not  been  argued  before
      us. We heard the appeal along with case  CDS  where  we  consider  the
      application of Article 8 in some detail from [16] onwards.  If we were
      wrong about our primary conclusion in the present case, we    consider
      it quite likely that Article 8 would prevent this  appellant's  course
      of studies in the United Kingdom being terminated for the reasons that
      it was.

  28. This appeal is allowed.
