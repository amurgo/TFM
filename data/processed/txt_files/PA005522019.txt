For the Appellant:     Mr Allison, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born in 1988.  He  appeals  with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Siddall) to dismiss his appeal on protection and human rights grounds.


    Anonymity Order

 2. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    History of the Appeal and Matters in Issue


 3. The basis of the Appellant's  claim  for  protection/  leave  on  human
    rights grounds was that he has a well-founded fear  of  persecution  in
    Nigeria for reasons of political opinion,  viz  active  support  for  a
    group called the Indigenous People  of  Biafra  (IPOB)  in  the  United
    Kingdom. He further claimed to face a real risk of serious harm from  a
    university based criminal gang known as  the  Aye  confraternity,  this
    group having attacked him in 2012.  Finally the Appellant asserted that
    his removal from the United Kingdom would be  contrary  to  the  United
    Kingdom's obligations under Article 3 of the ECHR,  first  because  the
    Appellant is HIV+ and would receive no treatment in Nigeria, and second
    because there was a real risk that he would commit suicide if  returned
    there.


 4. The Respondent rejected these claims. The Appellant appealed and by its
    decision dated 21st June 2019 the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the
    appeal on all four grounds.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the Appellant had  been  involved
    with the Aye confraternity  whilst  at  University,  and  that  he  was
    brutally beaten when he wanted to leave.  His injuries  and  PTSD  lend
    support to that account which is consistent with the country background
    information.   The Tribunal however found that the assault was not  the
    reason that the Appellant came to the United Kingdom - he came  because
    he wanted to study.  It was not satisfied that there would  be  at  any
    risk arising today. There would be no reason why the Aye  confraternity
    would be interested in tracking him down  or  harming  him  some  seven
    years after the events described.  The Tribunal found that if  in  fact
    he did face a risk, he would receive  sufficient  protection  from  the
    Nigerian authorities. In respect of the relevance  of  the  Appellant's
    HIV+ status, the Tribunal was not satisfied that there was a real  risk
    of serious harm in Nigeria, since the government there have  introduced
    access to free  anti-retroviral  therapies.   In  his  application  for
    permission to appeal the Appellant took no issue with either  of  those
    conclusions.   He did initially seek to challenge the findings  of  the
    Tribunal on the risk of  suicide,  but  this  ground  was  subsequently
    withdrawn with my consent.


 6. When the matter came before me at Manchester Civil  Justice  centre  on
    the 19th October 2020 the only issue remaining was  whether  the  Judge
    had erred in her approach to the Appellant's  political  commitment  to
    Biafran independence.


 7. This historical claim advanced  by  the  Appellant  was  that  when  in
    Nigeria he had been a  supporter  of  a  Biafran  rights  group  called
    MASSOB. After he had come to the United Kingdom he had supported  IPOB.
    The Tribunal accepted that he may  have  attended  a  demonstration  in
    2009/10, but that  his  evidence  of  political  involvement  prior  to
    departure from Nigeria was otherwise "vague"  and  "inconsistent".   It
    placed little weight on what purported to  be  warning  letters  and  a
    certificate of membership but was prepared  to  accept  that  at  least
    until 2016 the Appellant did have some limited  involvement  with  IPOB
    here.   He has however had no contact with the organisation since 2017.
     He only ever attended two demonstrations,  and  has  not  adduced  any
    independent evidence in respect of his claim to have helped  the  group
    with its website. There is no reason to think that he has ever come  to
    the adverse attention of the Nigerian authorities.  No  risk  therefore
    arose.

 8. At that preliminary hearing in the Upper Tribunal Mr Allison  submitted
    that in disposing of the issue  in  that  way  the  Tribunal  had  only
    completed half a job. It has erred in failing to consider whether there
    is a real risk that the Appellant would express his  political  beliefs
    in Nigeria, or be prevented from doing so for fear of  persecution.  In
    his oral evidence the Appellant had said that he would want to protest,
    despite the risks.  This evidence had to be evaluated in light  of  the
    accepted evidence that the Appellant had been  involved  in  a  Biafran
    group as long ago as 2009  and  that  he  had  renewed  this  political
    interest in the United Kingdom with his support for IPOB.  It had  been
    his evidence that the issue remained "very important" to  him  but  had
    been  forced  to  cease   current   involvement   simply   because   of
    circumstances - the IPOB leadership were effectively in hiding and  the
    Appellant could not afford to travel to take part in any  more  events.
    His HIV+ status and mental ill-health had further  prevented  him  from
    taking more active steps to re-engage  with  other  politically  active
    Biafrans here.


 9. By my decision promulgated on the 21st October 2020 I  found  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal had omitted to consider whether the  Appellant  was
    politically committed to the IPOB cause; at paragraph 58  the  decision
    records the evidence that the "issue remains very important to him" but
    the Tribunal does not go on to make findings on whether that  claim  is
    true.  There was therefore no consideration of the Appellant's evidence
    that he would continue to hold those beliefs if  returned  to  Nigeria,
    and that given the opportunity he would wish to manifest those views by
    taking part in activities such as demonstrations.  It  cannot  be  said
    that that omission was immaterial. I  was  unable  to  infer  from  the
    findings, as the Secretary of State invited me to do, that the Tribunal
    rejected the Appellant's evidence on the  point.  Had  the  Appellant's
    credibility been entirely rejected I may have been prepared to  do  so,
    but as is evident from the foregoing it was not: the Tribunal  accepted
    a good deal of the Appellant's factual claims.  Nor was I able to  find
    that the omission was irrelevant to the question of risk:  it  was  the
    Respondent's position in this case  that  IPOB  activity  would  indeed
    place an individual at risk of  politically  motivated  persecution  in
    Nigeria.

10. I therefore set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  aside  to  the
    limited extent identified above.  In view of the narrow  scope  of  the
    appeal going forward I retained  the  matter  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    There was, as a result of the pandemic,  some delay in  re-listing  but
    at the hearing on the 15th March 2021 I was able to hear oral  evidence
    from the Appellant as well as submissions from the parties, who were in
    agreement that the only question for me to decide was whether there  is
    a real risk that if he was to be  returned  to  Nigeria  the  Appellant
    would  engage  in  political   activities   in   support   of   Biafran
    independence/IPOB, or otherwise refrain from doing so because of a fear
    of persecution.



    The Re-Made Decision

11. In reaching this decision I have read all of the relevant documents but
    I have  had  particular  regard  to  the  following  material  relating
    directly to the Appellant:


           a) the Appellant's asylum interview dated 8th August 2018;
           b) photographs depicting IPOB meetings, featuring the leader  Mr
              Mazi Nlamdi Kanu and the Appellant;
           c) the evidence as recorded by the First-tier  Tribunal  at  its
              [�37-�44]
           d) Witness statement dated 14th February 2019
           e) Supplementary witness statement 12th March 2021
           f) Appellant's oral evidence


12. Although the risk of persecution for IPOB activists had not been placed
    in issue in this case I have also read the country background  material
    produced by the Appellant, and the CPIN  Nigeria:  Biafran  Separatists
    (April 2020). The CPIN states that IPOB has been  declared  an  illegal
    terrorist organisation in Nigeria [2.4.7] at and that whilst in general
    "low ranking sympathisers" would not be at risk for that reason,  there
    is  a  risk  of  arrest/violence   for   activists,   particularly   on
    demonstrations:


         2.4.9 IPOB has in recent years become the dominant  Biafran  group.
         Since 2015 the security  forces  have  reportedly  killed  10s  and
         arrested  100s  of  IPOB  supporters,   usually   when   disrupting
         demonstrations  or  marches  to   promote   Biafran   independence,
         particularly during 2015 to 2017. Also  a  number  of  IPOB  senior
         members have been arrested, including the IPOB leader  Nnamdi  Kanu
         who was jailed for 2 years and then subsequently  released  and  is
         reported to have the left the country. Following the ban of IPOB in
         2017, when all  its  activities  were  declared  illegal,  100s  of
         supporters of IPOB (but also  some  members  of  other  pro-Biafran
         groups) who  have  attended  protests  and  processions  have  been
         arrested and detained. There  have  also  been  a  few  reports  of
         persons who publicly display Biafran independence through flags and
         other insignia being arrested...


13. Having had the benefit of hearing  directly  from  the  Appellant,  and
    having read the detailed responses he gave to questions at interview, I
    have no doubt  at  all  that  he  is  genuinely  committed  to  Biafran
    secession from Nigeria. He spoke with fluency and confidence about  the
    history of Nigeria since independence, the Biafran war of  independence
    and why he sees himself as culturally  and  politically  distinct  from
    other Nigerians.   The Appellant believes that the religious,  cultural
    and social differences between the  different  regions,  in  particular
    between the north and south of Nigeria, are  such  that  it  was  post-
    colonial mistake to ever  try  and  amalgamate  all  of  these  various
    peoples into one nation state.   The  Appellant  explained  that  after
    independence the new Nigerian army was from  the  outset  dominated  by
    northerners. He believes that this gave them the idea  that  they  were
    "born to rule", and that they brought this arrogance to bear  over  the
    peoples of the south and east. Millions were killed  in  Biafra  during
    the war - bombed by Nigerian planes without the weapons to fight  back.
    People cannot just forget that.

14. This was the background to the Appellant's most recent  involvement  in
    Biafran politics. In 2015 he met with the leader of IBOP in London, and
    decided to join the organisation. Although the Appellant  is  aware  of
    other political movements with the same agenda as IPOB  he  decided  to
    join them because he believes in Kanu's vision, having listened to  his
    speeches etc online. The Appellant states that between 2015 and 2017 he
    helped with the IPOB  website,  but  also  disseminated  awareness  and
    literature about the issue in  the  Biafran  community  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  For instance, he put up posters in areas  like  Woolwich  and
    Peckham. He attended protests outside Abuja House when President Buhari
    came  to  the  United  Kingdom  demanding  a  referendum   on   Biafran
    independence.

15. The Appellant has not had any active involvement in  IPOB  since  2017.
    This cessation in activity was the  focus  of  submissions  before  me:
    whilst Mr McVeety did not call into  question  the  Appellant's  stated
    political convictions, the Secretary of State does challenge the extent
    of his commitment to them, given his apparent lack of interest  in  the
    past few years. McVeety asks me to weigh that  matter  in  the  balance
    when assessing whether or not the Appellant would  want  to  engage  in
    political activity should he return to Nigeria.

16. The Appellant himself says that  there  are  several  reasons  why  his
    involvement came to an end.  Firstly because  developments  in  Nigeria
    meant that Kanu and other members of the IPOB leadership had to go into
    hiding. In September 2017 a court in Nigeria revoked the bail that Kanu
    had been on since 2015 and ordered his arrest. A raid on  his  home  in
    Nigeria left a  number  of  IPOB  supporters  dead.  Everyone  who  the
    Appellant had previously been in contact  within  the  United  Kingdom,
    including Kanu  himself,  went  into  hiding.  Secondly,  a  series  of
    personal difficulties prevented the Appellant  from  engaging.  He  was
    placed in immigration detention  around  the  same  time  as  the  IPOB
    leadership had to go into hiding (I note from  the  objective  material
    produced that there is some suggestion that a  number  of  them  sought
    sanctuary in Israel). When he came out he was living  on  NASS  support
    and had no money to travel to meet with other  Biafrans.  He  found  it
    impossible  to  re-establish  his  old  contacts   and   his   security
    credentials for the website no longer worked.  Although he  did  manage
    to speak to a couple of people no-one knew the codes to  get  back  in.
    The situation was further complicated by the fact  that  the  Appellant
    was  told  that  he  was  HIV+,  and  was  thereafter  diagnosed   with
    depression, anxiety and PTSD, connected to events in Nigeria before  he
    came to the United Kingdom.   The Appellant is currently living in dire
    financial circumstances and has no access to  a  computer  so  has  not
    tried recently to get back onto  the  website,  although  when  he  has
    accessed it from his phone he can see that it is  still  active  so  he
    knows that someone, somewhere,  is maintaining it.  In addition to  all
    of that the Covid-19 meant that for over a year the Appellant has  been
    required to shield, because he is immuno-suppressed.


17. Although the Appellant has not, for all of these reasons, been actively
    involved in the United Kingdom  over  the  past  couple  of  years,  he
    averred before me that he has continued to take a day to  day  interest
    in developments. He exhibited to his witness statement a number of  key
    articles on recent events  in  Nigeria  as  examples  of  the  kind  of
    material he is reading.  These include pieces on  Biafran  politics  as
    well as recent news items about IPOB supporters being killed in clashes
    with Nigerian security forces. In respect of his future intentions  the
    Appellant says this:

         "If I were to return to Nigeria, I  would  try  to  get  even  more
         involved  in  the  movement's  activities  by  protesting,  sharing
         flyers, and  anything  that  would  bring  more  attention  to  the
         struggle. I  am  more  convinced  now  that  Biafra  should  be  an
         independent state. I am  aware  that  openly  supporting  the  pro-
         Biafran independence movement carries  risks  of  being  harmed  or
         arrested by the Nigerian authorities, but I have  nothing  to  lose
         and this is the most important issue to me".


18. In my evaluation of the truthfulness of this statement I bear  in  mind
    that the burden of proof lies on the Appellant, and that he  must  show
    that it is reasonably likely to be true.    In favour of his claim  are
    the following matters. I accept  that  he  is  genuinely  committed  to
    Biafran independence, to IPOB and to Mr  Kanu  in  particular  whom  he
    describes as a charismatic and "supreme" leader.   I  accept  that  the
    Appellant has had a long history of  interest  in  the  matter,  having
    attended at least one protest before he ever left Nigeria, and that  in
    the United Kingdom,  when  able  to  do  so,  he  undertook  activities
    including volunteering for  work  on  the  IPOB  website,  distributing
    leaflets, putting up posters and talking to other Nigerians  about  the
    issue.   I accept that  his  commitment  to  this  cause  has  probably
    intensified over the years and that he has kept abreast of developments
    and maintains a keen  interest  in  IPOB.  As  the  parties  before  me
    identified, the real question is whether the 'gap' in activities in the
    last few years is  such  that  the  Appellant's  assertions  about  his
    intentions  can  properly  be  rejected.  After  weighing  all  of  the
    available evidence I am not satisfied that they  can.    The  Appellant
    has given several very good reasons why he ceased his activities in the
    United Kingdom after he was taken into immigration detention. I  accept
    that if he were to be returned to  Nigeria,  into  the  centre  of  the
    dispute, that the Appellant would feel moved to resume  the  activities
    that he has not latterly felt able to undertake here.     If he did so,
    the Respondent has accepted, there would be a real risk of  persecution
    for reasons of his political belief. It follows that the appeal must be
    allowed.
