For the Appellant:     Ms Z Kiss, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss  under  the  rules  an  appeal  by  the
    respondent, who I will call  the  claimant,  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision to refuse to extend her leave to remain and  to  remove
    her from the United Kingdom but to allow her appeal against the decision
    with reference to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Thailand who was born in 1983 who has lived
    in the United Kingdom since May 2009 with permission as  a  student.  At
    the end of July 2012, shortly before her leave was about to expire,  she
    applied for her leave to be varied and for further permission to stay as
    a student.  There was an obvious  difficulty  in  the  application.   It
    looked as though the claim could not possibly succeed because  it  would
    result in her having more than three years' leave in the United  Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 Migrant studying at below graduate level.

 3. As Ms Kiss has pointed out, this requirement came into the Rules a  full
    year before the claimant made her application and  she  either  knew  or
    should have known that she  had  made  an  application  that  could  not
    succeed.  It may be that she knew because she tried  to  get  round  the
    problem by a rather contrived  argument  suggesting  that  she  had  not
    actually spent more than three years in undergraduate study.   This  was
    an argument that failed before the First-tier  Tribunal  being,  as  the
    judge found, based on an unbelievable scenario.  That  finding  has  not
    been challenged.

 4.  It  follows  therefore  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  no
    difficulty in concluding that the appeal  under  the  Rules  had  to  be
    dismissed.

 5. The First-tier Tribunal judge then  allowed  the  appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds and has given skimpy reasons for that  finding.   It  is  really
    only by going to the claimant's witness statement that any sense can  be
    made of the decision.  There, she said that her family had supported her
    in the sum of between �10,000 to �12,000 for her maintenance and  course
    costs and this would be lost if she was  not  allowed  to  complete  the
    course that she had started. The  judge  said,  rather  confusingly,  "I
    accept that the application of the Immigration Rules  are  necessary  to
    apply a consistent set of Rules, but the [claimant] has  shown  that  it
    would be disproportionate for  her  to  leave  the  UK  before  a  month
    subsequent to the conclusion of her course in October 2013".

 6. I do not understand that, and Ms Kiss for the Secretary of  State  could
    not help me.  The Secretary of  State  made  her  decision  made  on  19
    February 2013. Save for any extension consequent on an  application  for
    further leave to remain, the claimant's permission to be in  the  United
    Kingdom lapsed on 25 July 2012. I cannot understand  why  anybody  would
    say that the consequence of the decision  would  be  that  the  claimant
    would have to leave the United Kingdom "before a month subsequent to the
    conclusion of her course in October 2013".  I really do  not  know  what
    the judge meant.

 7. It is settled law, and probably in the judge's mind when he referred  to
    CDS (PBS: "available": Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT 00305  (IAC),  that
    preventing a person completing  a  course  can  have  enormous  personal
    consequences.  It can frustrate long-held  ambitions.  It  can  waste  a
    great deal of money. It can deprive  a  person  of  the  opportunity  of
    completing a very significant educational achievement.

 8. None of these things  really  impact  to  the  present  case  where  the
    claimant was studying a one year course with  a  view  to  going  on  to
    obtain a higher diploma in business management.  There is no explanation
    in the claimant's evidence, for example,  for  her  not  continuing  the
    course in Thailand or elsewhere, or why the sums spent would be  wasted.
    Sometimes fees can be refunded or transferred.

 9. Neither is there  any  consideration  on  the  part  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge of  the  fact  that  the  problem  was  entirely  of  the
    claimant's own making. She pressed ahead with a course when  she  really
    should have appreciated that she was not going to be given permission to
    remain.

10. The decision to allow the appeal on article 8 grounds is clearly  wrong.
    At the very least it is not explained in a way that can  be  understood.
    In the absence of any explanation it does not show proper regard to  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules to ensure consistency and fairness
    in immigration policy.  Neither does it pay any regard  at  all  to  the
    requirement of the Rules that requires a  person  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom after more than three years' undergraduate study.

11. Clearly,  the  will  of  Parliament  expressed  in  the  Rules  is  that
    ordinarily people cannot be allowed to stay in  the  United  Kingdom  as
    undergraduate students until such time as they become entitled to remain
    by some other route.  That is just not  what  the  Rules  intend  to  do
    concerning the admission of students.

12. In the  circumstances  I  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

13. I then have to decide what to do.  The difficulty in the  case  is  that
    the claimant did not attend the hearing in the Upper Tribunal.  I do not
    know why she did not attend.  She was given proper notice of the hearing
    at the address she used on her witness statement being the same  address
    recorded on the Tribunal's papers as the address for service. Although I
    have tried to understand the claimant's case and Ms Kiss  has  presented
    the Secretary of State's case fairly, I have little option  but  to  say
    the case must be dismissed on  Article  8  grounds.   There  is  nothing
    before me which will enable me to conclude properly  that  it  would  be
    other than a wholly proportionate  interference  with  her  private  and
    family life to remove her for the  purpose  of  maintaining  immigration
    control and an orderly immigration policy.  These things impact  on  the
    economic well being on the United Kingdom and on the rights and freedoms
    of others.

14. Whether I would have reached this conclusion if she had  come  and  told
    me that she only needed a very  short  period  of  leave  to  remain  to
    complete her course, I just do not know.  She did not, and that  is  not
    any fault of mine of the Secretary of State's.

15. In the circumstances I allow the Secretary of  State's  appeal  and  set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.
