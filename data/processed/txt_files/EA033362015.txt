Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Herself and Sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal of Gracilene Caldeira  de
       Lima, a citizen of Brazil born 9 May 1978,  against  the  refusal  to
       issue her  with  a  residence  card  as  the  partner  in  a  durable
       relationship of an EEA  national  exercising  Treaty  Rights  in  the
       United Kingdom.

    2. Her application had been refused because the Respondent's attempt  to
       confirm that her Sponsor (a Portuguese national, Rui Manuel Mucavele)
       was still working here, met with a response from the  employer  named
       in the application form that he  longer  worked  with  them;  no  new
       employer had been identified to the Secretary of State.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal set out the evidence provided with the appeal
       form.  The  Appellant  had  apologised  for  failing  to  update  the
       Secretary of State with her partner's employment arrangements: he was
       now working with Tulip LTA in  their  factory  in  Bury  St  Edmunds,
       Dalehead Foods. She  apologised  for  previously  stating  they  were
       married. They had been together for twelve years and had  a  daughter
       now. She provided evidence from Dalehead Foods confirming Mr Mucavele
       was employed by them as a factory production operative, since 19 July
       2015 and continuing as at 2 December 2015, and payslips for him  from
       July to November 2015; all the documents placed  both  Appellant  and
       Sponsor at  the  same  address.  She  also  provided  money  transfer
       receipts from him and their child's Portuguese  citizenship  identity
       card showing the Appellant and Sponsor as her parents.

    4. Noting that she had entered the country with a  family  permit  valid
       until 3 December 2015, the  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted  that  the
       Respondent's delay in considering the application had contributed  to
       the change of circumstances  by  the  date  of  decision.  There  was
       sufficient evidence overall to establish that the Appellant  was  the
       extended  family  member  of  an  EEA  national  given   that   their
       relationship was clearly genuine and that  they  cohabited  together.
       The appeal accordingly fell to be allowed.

    5. The Secretary of State appealed on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had been wrong to allow the appeal outright, when  the  most
       that could have been achieved, applying Aladeselu & Ors (2006 Regs  -
       reg 8) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 253 (IAC) was that  the  appeal  could  be
       allowed  to  the  extent  that  it  remains  outstanding  before  the
       Secretary of State, as the discretion to consider whether in all  the
       circumstances the grant of a residence card was appropriate  had  not
       so far been exercised. Before me, Mr Bramble relied on those grounds.



    6. Permission to appeal was granted on 17 August 2016 by the  First-tier
       Tribunal on the basis that these grounds appeared to have force.

Findings and reasons

    7. The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 provides:

           ""Extended family member"

           8. (1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a
           person who is not a family member of an EEA national under
           regulation 7(1)(a), (b) or (c) and who satisfies the conditions
           in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5). ...

           (5) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the
           person is the partner of an EEA national (other than a civil
           partner) and can prove to the decision maker that he is in a
           durable relationship with the EEA national.

           17.

           (1) The Secretary of State must issue a residence card to a
           person who is not an EEA national and is the family member of a
           qualified person or of an EEA national with a permanent right of
           residence under regulation 15 on application and production of-
           (a) a valid passport; and (b) proof that the applicant is such a
           family member. ...

           (4) The Secretary of State may issue a residence card to an
           extended family member not falling within regulation 7(3) who is
           not an EEA national on application if-

           (a) the relevant EEA national in relation to the extended family
           member is a qualified person or an EEA national with a permanent
           right of residence under regulation 15; and

           (b) in all the circumstances it  appears  to  the  Secretary  of
           State appropriate to issue the residence card."

    8. Mr Bramble rightly did not contest the adequacy of  the  findings  of
       the First-tier Tribunal as to the genuine nature of the  relationship
       and the Sponsor's exercise of Treaty Rights.  However,  he  was  also
       correct to maintain that this was  an  appeal  where  the  Tribunal's
       powers were limited to allowing the appeal because  of  the  original
       decision's failure to accord with the law  as  the  Respondent  never
       exercised her discretion to consider whether it  was  appropriate  to
       issue a residence card, see Aladeselu and Others (2006 Regs - reg  8)
       Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00253(IAC) referencing another discretion  within
       the EEA Regulations at  [31]:  "Whilst  we  can  consider  whether  a
       discretionary power should have been exercised differently, we cannot
       seek to do that if there has as yet been no exercise of that power."

    9. This is not one of  those  cases  where  the  discretion  could  only
       reasonably be exercised in the  Appellant's  favour.  It  seems  that
       misleading information may have  been  given  at  one  point  in  the
       application's history, though she has fully explained  that  now  and
       made a written apology. The relationship is a  genuine  one  and  she
       obtained a family permit to come here before travelling. Nevertheless
       these factors must be evaluated by the Secretary of State.

   10. I accordingly  allow  the  appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State  and
       substitute for  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  my  own
       conclusion, which is that the decision of the Respondent was  not  in
       accordance with the law and that the Appellant's application  remains
       outstanding before her in order  for  the  discretion  in  Regulation
       17(4) to be lawfully exercised.

          Decision:

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.
