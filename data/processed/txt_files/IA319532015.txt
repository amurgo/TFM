For the Respondent:    Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, a Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    on 16 September 2015 to refuse him  further  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General)  Migrant  under  the  points-based
    system.

 2. The application in question was made on 27 June 2014,  at  which  point
    the course applied for would have come within the  5-year  postgraduate
    category under paragraph 245ZX(c) with reference to paragraph 116(e) of
    Appendix A and 245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules.

 3. On 29 October 2012, the appellant began to study  an  ACCA  accountancy
    course and the London School of Business and Finance,  in  anticipation
    of the respondent's decision. The course was due to be completed on  10
    June 2015. However, on 17 November 2012, before he could  complete  his
    course, the appellant suffered an accident at work.   A  vehicle  drove
    into the petrol station where he worked,  leaving  him  with  PTSD  and
    physiological problems  and  there  is  a  certain  amount  of  medical
    evidence indicating that he remained in both physical and psychological
    difficulties until shortly before his application for  further  Tier  4
    leave, made on 27 June 2014.

 4. The appellant's Tier 4 sponsor was Greenwich London College, which lost
    its Tier 4 sponsor status in early 2015, invalidating the CAS which the
    appellant had  submitted  in  June  2014  with  his  application.   The
    appellant had still received no response to his application for further
    Tier 4 leave by June 2015, over a year since his application.

 5. On 19 June 2015, the  respondent  gave  the  appellant  notice  of  the
    invalidity of his  CAS  and  provided  him  with  what  the  respondent
    described as a Patel letter, giving him 60 days in which  to  obtain  a
    new sponsor and a valid CAS.  There were then only 4 months left of the
    5-year cap on study: applying the decision in Patel (Tier 4 -  no  '60-
    day extension') India [2011] UKUT 187  (IAC),  the  60-day  period  was
    inapplicable as the appellant had less than 6 months' leave to run.

 6. On 13 August 2015, six days before the expiry  of  the  60-day  letter,
    Universal Solicitors wrote to the respondent, informing her that it had
    not proved possible for the appellant to obtain a further  CAS  because
    the period for which he had been in the United Kingdom for the  purpose
    of study would reach 5  years  on  28  October  2015.   No  educational
    institution was prepared to issue him with a CAS to complete  his  ACCA
    course on that basis, without  confirmation  that  the  respondent  was
    prepared to extend or waive the 5-year cap.

 7. Universal Solicitors explained that the appellant had  been  unable  to
    complete his ACCA course after the accident, for  health  reasons:  his
    health had been affected for up to 20 months and the appellant had only
    just been fit to begin studying again in June 2014, when  he  made  the
    present application.  They set out  the  medical  treatment  which  the
    appellant had  received.   They  cited  and  relied  upon  transitional
    provisions at [124] of the respondent's August 2015 Tier 4 guidance.

 8. On 16 September 2015, the respondent refused the Tier 4 application  on
    the basis that the appellant had not produced a valid CAS within the 60-
    day period. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

    First-tier Tribunal decision

 9. On 21 October 2016 the First-tier Tribunal  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal in a very brief decision, with the ratio decidendi in  the  last
    paragraph:

         "4.  It is no longer open to an appellant to appeal  on  the  basis
         that a decision was 'not in accordance with the law'.   The  appeal
         was not based on that ground.  In any event,  the  reliance  placed
         upon the appellant under Tier 4 of the points-based system - Policy
         Guidance  version  08/15  Paragraph  124  refers  to   'exceptional
         compelling  or  compassionate  circumstances  for  example  serious
         illness or disability'.  Even if I had  jurisdiction  to  entertain
         this appeal upon the grounds that it was not in accordance with the
         law, which I do not, I would also have found that the appellant had
         failed to satisfy me to  the  relevant  standard  [the  balance  of
         probabilities] that, first, the respondent did  not  consider  this
         policy guidance (it is clear from the refusal letter that it  did),
         but  that,  although  the  appellant  did   suffer   physical   and
         psychiatric injuries,  they  did  not  amount  to  exceptional   or
         compelling and compassionate circumstances, such that the period of
         leave  counted  towards  the  [5-year]  time  limit  would  not  be
         substantially extended."

    Permission to appeal to Upper Tribunal

10. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal. Permission was granted by
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge McCarthy on the basis that:

 i) it was arguable that the respondent's decision was contrary to her  own
    policy and thus not in accordance with law;

ii)  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  arguably  failed   to   consider   the
    transitional provisions for the implementation of the  Immigration  Act
    2014, the effect  of  which  was  that  the  pre-2014  regime  remained
    applicable to this application and the 'not  in  accordance  with  law'
    ground was available to the appellant;

iii) even if that were not the case, applying SF and others (Guidance, post-
    2014 Act) [2017] UKUT 120 (IAC),

                  "Even in the absence of a "not in accordance with the law"
                  ground of appeal, the Tribunal ought to take the Secretary
                  of State's guidance into account if it points clearly to a
                  particular outcome in the instant case. Only in  that  way
                  can consistency be obtained between those cases  that  do,
                  and those cases that do not, come before the Tribunal";

             and that

iv) it was arguable  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  no  paid  proper
    attention  to  the  factual  and  legal  arguments  presented  by   the
    appellant.




    The respondent's Tier 4 guidance

11. The respondent's August 2015 guidance at  [124] is as follows:

         "124.    We will count the full period [of Tier  4  leave  granted]
         unless  there  are   exceptional   compelling   and   compassionate
         circumstances (for example, serious illness or disability)."

12. However, the August 2015 policy is not the applicable  policy,  because
    at [126] it says this:

         "Transitional arrangements

         126. Where you are applying for leave  with  a  CAS  issued  on  or
         before 9 August 2015, we will consider applications  in  accordance
         with the Rules and guidance in place on 2 August 2015."

    The CAS relied upon in the 2014 application was issued before  27  June
    2014.  Although the application was outstanding in August 2015,  it  is
    therefore the April 2015 Rules and Tier 4 Guidance which apply.

13. The April 2015 guidance contains no provision equivalent  to  [124]  of
    the August 2015 policy. Serious illness and  exceptional  circumstances
    apply in the April 2015 guidance only to extension of time  for  making
    the Tier 4 renewal application.

14. Although there is no express provision  for  waiver  or  extension  for
    serious illness in the  April  2015  policy,  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe  who
    appeared for the respondent accepted that it would be  disproportionate
    if the respondent did not consider extension or waiver  in  appropriate
    circumstances.

    Discussion

15. The appellant contends that  his  ill  health  following  the  accident
    amounts to exceptional circumstances for which the respondent should be
    prepared to waive or extend the 5-year cap.  The  evidence  adduced  in
    the 13 August 2015 letter suggested  that  for  about  20  months,  the
    appellant had not been able to study on his 3-year ACCA course.   There
    is no sign in the September 2015 letter that the respondent  considered
    whether to extend or waive the  5-year  cap,  despite  the  appellant's
    express request that she so consider.

16. The respondent's refusal letter treated the request  for  extension  or
    waiver of the 5-year cap on health grounds  as  an  application  for  a
    further 60-day extension, which on the facts of this application, would
    have been futile.  The respondent's  failure  to  engage  with  the  13
    August 2015 and confirm that a waiver or extension of the 5-year period
    would be granted, made it impossible for the appellant  to  obtain  any
    valid CAS.

17. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the respondent's decision  is  not  in
    accordance  with  law,  alternatively,  that  she  has  not   exercised
    discretion outside the Rules as contemplated in  SF  and  others.   The
    respondent's offer of a 60-day extension in June  2015,  and  again  in
    September 2015, was frustrated, without such consideration, by the fact
    that in June only four months of the 5-year  period  remained,  and  in
    September only 2 months.  The respondent's failure to consider  whether
    to waive or extend the 5-year cap was disproportionate and unlawful.

18. I therefore allow this  appeal  to  the  extent  that  the  appellant's
    application of 27 June 2014 for further Tier 4 leave remains before the
    respondent for a lawful decision in due course, taking into account the
    request made in the letter of 13 August 2015 and  the  matters  therein
    set out.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it to the extent  that  the
appellant's Tier 4 application remains before the respondent  for  a  lawful
decision.
