                       ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION TRIBUNAL


                            THE IMMIGRATION ACTS

Heard at: Field House
Date of Hearing: 21 August 2008

                                   Before:


 Miss E Arfon-Jones, Deputy President of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal
                       Senior Immigration Judge Mather

                                   Between

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

The ECJ did not  consider  the  provisions  of  Article  3(2)  of  Directive
2004/38/EC, which deals with other family members, in Case C-127/08  Metock,
which was concerned with a spouse.  Metock has no direct  relevance  to  the
interpretation of Article 3(2).  It has not overruled KG and AK (Sri  Lanka)
v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 13, which remains good law on  the  meaning  of  that
Article and its relationship with regulation 8 of the Immigration  (European
Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  Nor does  Metock  overrule  the  whole  of
Case C-109/01 Akrich [2003] ECR I-960; the court having only  concluded  (at
paragraph  58)  that  paragraphs  50  and  51  of  Akrich   needed   to   be
reconsidered.

Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr R Scannell, Counsel, instructed by Tamil Welfare
                       Association
For the Respondent:          Mr A Sharland, Counsel, instructed by Treasury
Solicitor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, born 28 September 1978, is a citizen of Sri Lanka.

 2. On 8 June 2006 the respondent refused to issue  the  appellant  with  a
    residence card as confirmation of his  right  of  residence  under  the
    Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)   Regulations   2006   ("the
    Regulations").  The appellant had claimed that  right  as  an  extended
    family member of Mrs Panchalingam, an EEA  national  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom (the sponsor).

 3. The appellant, who had arrived  in  the  UK  in  March  2001,  had  not
    appealed against the refusal to grant him asylum in 2001.

 4. The basis on which the appellant had sought the issue of the  residence
    card was that the sponsor, a German national, had  first  come  to  the
    United Kingdom in 1997 as a worker.  She had been granted  a  residence
    permit as an EEA national exercising treaty rights.  The appellant  had
    claimed to be a dependant relative of the sponsor, a second  cousin  to
    whom he referred as "aunt".

 5. The respondent had sought evidence from the appellant's representatives
    of his residence with the sponsor as part of  her  household  prior  to
    entering the United Kingdom.  Some documents had  been  sent  from  Sri
    Lanka but they gave no indication  of  the  dates  when  the  appellant
    claimed to have lived with the sponsor.  The sponsor entered the United
    Kingdom 4 years before the appellant, in 1997.

 6. The appeal came before Immigration Judge  Greasley  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 17 July 2006.  At that hearing evidence was given by both  the
    appellant and the sponsor.

 7. The appellant gave evidence that his mother had died of cancer in  1998
    and that the sponsor was his aunt.  He claimed that after the deaths of
    his mother and grandmother, he had remained with  his  father  and  his
    sister who had looked after  him.   Whilst  living  in  Sri  Lanka  the
    appellant claimed that he and his father and sister were  supported  by
    the sponsor from the United Kingdom, funds being sent to them regularly
    on a monthly basis.

 8. The appellant further claimed that he  had  lived  with  the  sponsor's
    sister, Mrs Kiritharakopalan, in the United Kingdom  between  2001  and
    2006.  That had been at the request of the sponsor  who  had  supported
    him to the extent of providing him with �50 per week.  He had  remained
    with Mrs Kiritharakopalan until he moved in with the sponsor, where  he
    had remained.

 9. The sponsor, who also gave evidence before Immigration Judge  Greasley,
    confirmed the relationship, which was not  challenged.   She  confirmed
    that she had supported the appellant both in Sri Lanka  and  since  his
    arrival in the United Kingdom.

10. It is accepted that the appellant has never lived in Germany.   It  was
    acknowledged that the appellant was unable to benefit  from  Regulation
    8(2) of the Regulations nor was he able to satisfy the criteria set out
    in any of the Immigration Rules.  However,  it  was  submitted  on  his
    behalf that his appeal should be  granted  pursuant  to  Article  3  of
    Directive 2004/38/EC ("the Directive") because  the  appellant  asserts
    that the Regulations have not properly  transposed  the  terms  of  the
    Directive into UK law.

11. Despite the arguments submitted on behalf of the respondent by the Home
    Office Presenting Officer, that there was no reliable evidence relating
    to a household having been created in Sri Lanka and that  there  was  a
    paucity  of  evidence  relating  to  dependency  in  Sri   Lanka,   the
    Immigration Judge allowed the appeal "to the extent that it is remitted
    to the Secretary of State".

12. The Immigration Judge, at paragraphs 27-30 of the determination, said:

        "27.      I  accept  that  the  appellant  has  provided  proof  of
             dependency in Sri Lanka, in the form of a letter from a village
             headman, and a GP, but also there is documentary evidence  from
             a store in  Sri  Lanka  which  claims  that  regular  financial
             payments were regularly sent from the sponsor to the  appellant
             whilst living in  his  native  country.   The  authenticity  or
             genuineness of those documents was not challenged at the appeal
             hearing.


         28. I accept that the appellant has been financially dependant upon
             the sponsor, and I find  the  appellant  is  still  financially
             dependant  on  the  sponsor,  who  it  would  appear  has   now
             undertaken financial support for the appellant, since the death
             of his mother in 1999.


         29. I therefore accept that the appellant is dependant upon an  EEA
             national and that he has never lived with the EEA  national  in
             Germany.  I find the appellant  has  been  dependant  upon  the
             sponsor since his arrival in the United Kingdom, and that  that
             dependency is continuing until the present day.

         30. In all the circumstances, I therefore find that the decision to
             refuse  the  application  pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (EEA)
             Regulations 2006, is not in accordance with the law."

13.   The respondent submitted grounds for reconsideration  dated  3  August
    2006 arguing that the determination was fundamentally flawed because of
    an incorrect interpretation of the  Directive,  and  in  particular  at
    paragraph 2(a) thereof in respect of the phrase "in  the  country  from
    which they have come".

14.   Senior Immigration Judge Drabu ordered reconsideration  on  10  August
    2006, satisfied that the grounds for review raised arguable  issues  of
    law which, if established, could alter the outcome of the appeal.

15.   Thus the matter came before us.

16.   This reconsideration first came before us some time ago.  The  hearing
    was adjourned for a variety of reasons and there were abortive hearings
    thereafter.  The matter came before us for final disposal on 21  August
    2008.  We treated that hearing as a de novo hearing, not least  because
    of the volume of recent jurisprudence.

17.   At the outset of the hearing Mr Sharland made an  application  to  re-
    open the issue of dependency.  We considered that as that issue had not
    either been raised in the grounds which had contended that the Tribunal
    had made an error of law, or had been argued  at  any  of  the  earlier
    reconsideration hearings, it was too late to challenge a factual  issue
    for the first time.  The grounds were therefore limited to those raised
    in the application for reconsideration.  It follows  that  Mr  Sharland
    did not pursue paragraphs 16 and 18 inclusive of his skeleton argument.

18.   So as to identify with clarity the issues it would be helpful  in  our
    view to set out the relevant legal provisions at this stage.

19.   Regulation 8 of the Regulations provides:

        "8.      Extended family member


             (1)  In these Regulations  "extended  family  member"  means  a
                 person who is not a family member of an EEA national  under
                 regulation 7(1)(a),  (b)  or  (c)  and  who  satisfies  the
                 conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).


             (2)  A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the
                 person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or  his
                 civil partner and -


                 (a)   the person is residing in an EEA State in  which  the
                     EEA national also resides and is  dependent  upon  the
                     EEA national or is a member of his household;


                 (b)   the person satisfied the condition  in paragraph  (a)
                     and is accompanying the EEA  national  to  the  United
                     Kingdom or wishes to join him there; or


                 (c)   the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a),
                     has joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom  and
                     continues to be dependent upon him or to be  a  member
                     of his household."


20.   Regulation 2 defines "EEA State" thus:

        "(a)     a member State, other than the United Kingdom;
          (b) Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein; or
          (c) Switzerland;"


21.   Regulation 12(2) of the Regulations provides:

        "12.     ...


        (2)      An entry clearance officer may issue an EEA family permit
             to an extended family member of an EEA national who applies for
             one if-
             (a)  the relevant EEA national satisfies the condition in
                 paragraph (1)(a);
             (b)  the extended family member wishes to accompany the
                 relevant EEA national to the United Kingdom or to join him
                 there; and
             (c)  in all the circumstances, it appears to the entry
                 clearance officer appropriate to issue the EEA family
                 permit."

22.   Article 2 of the Directive provides that:

          "For the purposes of this Directive:


          1)      "Union citizen" means any person having the nationality of
              a Member State;


          2)      "Family member" means:


              (a)      the spouse;


              (b)       the  partner  with  whom  the  Union  citizen   has
                  contracted a registered partnership, on the basis of  the
                  legislation of a Member State, if the legislation of  the
                  host  Member  State  treats  registered  partnerships  as
                  equivalent  to  marriage  and  in  accordance  with   the
                  conditions laid down in the relevant legislation  of  the
                  host Member State;


              (c)      the direct descendants who are under the age  of  21
                  or are dependants and those of the spouse or  partner  as
                  defined in point (b);


              (d)      the dependent direct relatives in the ascending line
                  and those of the spouse or partner as  defined  in  point
                  (b);


          3)      "Host Member State" means the  Member  State  to  which  a
              Union citizen moves in order to  exercise  his/her  right  of
              free movement and residence."


23.   Article 3 provides:


          "Beneficiaries


          1.      This Directive shall apply to all Union citizens who  move
              to or reside in a Member State other than that of which  they
              are a national, and to their family  members  as  defined  in
              point 2 of Article 2 who accompany or join them.


          2.      Without prejudice  to  any  right  to  free  movement  and
              residence the persons concerned may have in their own  right,
              the host Member State shall, in accordance with its  national
              legislation, facilitate entry and residence for the following
              persons:


              (a)      any other  family  members,  irrespective  of  their
                  nationality, not falling under the definition in point  2
                  of Article 2 who, in the country  from  which  they  have
                  come, are dependants or members of the household  of  the
                  Union citizen having the primary right of  residence,  or
                  where  serious  health  grounds  strictly   require   the
                  personal care of the family member by the Union citizen;


              (b)      the partner  with  whom  the  Union  citizen  has  a
                  durable relationship, duly attested.


              The  host  Member  State   shall   undertake   an   extensive
              examination of the personal circumstances and  shall  justify
              any denial of entry or residence to these people".


24.   The phrase "in the country from  which  they  have  come"  in  Article
    3(2)(a) is at the heart of this appeal.  The issue for determination by
    us is whether that phrase is to be interpreted in  such  a  way  as  to
    limit the Directive's application to those who  have  come  from  other
    member states.

25.   It is the appellant's submission that he is entitled to  residence  in
    the United Kingdom by virtue of Article 3(2) of the Directive.

26.   Since the earlier hearings in this matter, the Tribunal has been  much
    assisted by the Court of Appeal judgements in KG and AK (Sri  Lanka)  v
    SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 13.

27.   Mr Sharland urged us to accept that KG and AK was decided  on  similar
    facts and was very much on point and  therefore  determinative  of  the
    appellant's claim.  He  drew  our  attention  to  Buxton  LJ's  leading
    judgement and urged us to treat KG and AK as  binding  on  us.   Buxton
    LJ's detailed analysis of Article 3 is set out in  his  judgement.   Mr
    Sharland urged us to find that Buxton LJ had expressed with clarity the
    distinction between family members and "other family members".   As  in
    KG and AK the appellant has  never  been  in  Germany  or  indeed  ever
    resided in an EEA country, other than the UK.

28.   Mr Sharland argued that the Court of Appeal judgement is  relevant  in
    contrast to the recent European Court of Justice Case  C-127/08  Metock
    and Others.  He submitted that Metock was of limited  relevance  as  it
    did not address the issue of "other family members".   He  also  argued
    that there was no basis on which the applicability of Metock  could  be
    broadened to other family members.  It dealt  only  with  spouses.   He
    said it was important not to confuse the issue of freedom  of  movement
    with that of family reunion, and urged us to reject any argument  which
    supported displacing the Court of Appeal's judgement in KG and AK  with
    the recent ECJ judgement in Metock.

29.   Unsurprisingly, Mr Scannell addressed us on the basis that Metock  was
    on point and binding on us.  He argued that the interpretation  of  the
    phrase  "in  the  country  from  where  they  have  come"  is  now   as
    unequivocally stated in Metock.  He referred us to paragraph 82  of  KG
    and AK where Buxton LJ indicated that in some  circumstances  he  might
    have considered it appropriate to refer the issue  to  the  ECJ  for  a
    definitive ruling.  He said in paragraph 82 of the judgement:


        "82.     If it were necessary for the resolution of these cases  to
             decide the issue as to the application of  article  3(2)(a)  to
             Union citizens who  move  other  than  between  member  states,
             referred to in �68 above, then subject to  further  argument  I
             would be inclined to think that a reference to the ECJ might be
             necessary on that point.  In the  event,  the  issue  does  not
             affect the outcome of these appeals, and therefore a  reference
             could not be justified.  And, further, as demonstrated in �� 72-
             80 above the appeals must fail on the facts whatever  view  was
             taken of the central issue of construction.   That  is  another
             reason for a reference to be out of the question."

30.   Mr Scannell argued that Metock was binding on us and  that,  following
    it, the appellant was entitled to have  his  appeal  allowed.   In  the
    alternative, Mr Scannell urged us to consider making a reference to the
    ECJ on the construction point.

31.   Praying in aid the fact that it was  the  Grand  Chamber  of  the  ECJ
    which had pronounced  in  Metock,  Mr  Scannell  sought  very  hard  to
    persuade us that the case applied to other family members.  He referred
    us to Article 10 of the Directive which confers the right of  residence
    on family members of a Union citizen who are not  themselves  nationals
    of a member state.  He relied in particular on paragraph 2(e)  and  (f)
    of Article 10.  For the issue of residence cards  the  presentation  of
    certain documents such as passport and documentary evidence  of  family
    relationship etc is required.  Paragraphs 2(e) and (f)  of  Article  10
    provide:

        "(e)     In cases falling under Article 3(2)(a), a document  issued
             by the relevant authority in the country of origin  or  country
             from  which  they  are  arriving  certifying  that   they   are
             dependents or members of the household of the Union citizen, or
             proof of the existence of serious health grounds which strictly
             require the personal care of the family  member  by  the  Union
             citizen;


        (f)      In cases falling  under  Article  3(2)(b),  proof  of  the
             existence of a durable relationship with the Union citizen."

32.   Mr  Scannell  submitted  that  those  provisions  applied  equally  to
    extended family members as to core family members.   Mutatis  mutandis,
    Article 2(2) applies to Article 3(2).

33.   He reminded us that lawful residence in the EEA was not a  requirement
    and that Article 10, which provided for the issue of  residence  cards,
    does not require the presentation of evidence of prior residence in the
    EEA.

34.   Mr Scannell also prayed in aid the  fact  that  Case  C-109/01  Akrich
    [2003] ECR I-9607 had been expressly overturned by the Grand Chamber of
    the ECJ.  He reminded us that the  purpose  of  the  Directive  was  to
    "strengthen the right of free  movement  and  residence  of  all  Union
    citizens".  What was important was to have in place a  framework  which
    did not discourage Union citizens from moving to or residing  in  other
    member states regardless of whether  or  not  the  family  was  already
    lawfully resident in the territory of another member  state  (paragraph
    64 of Metock).

35.   Mr Scannell also relied on the fact that  Article  3(2)  included  not
    only dependant family members but also civil partners.

36.   He placed great reliance on paragraph 84 of Metock which says:

        "84.     Having regard to the context and objectives  of  Directive
             2004/38, the provisions of that directive cannot be interpreted
             restrictively, and must not in any event be deprived  of  their
             effectiveness."


37.   He reminded us that paragraph 90 of Metock went on to say:

        "90.     It must therefore be held  that  nationals  of  non-member
             countries who are family members of a Union citizen derive from
             Directive 2004/38 the right to join that Union citizen  in  the
             host Member state, whether  he  has  become  established  there
             before or after founding a family."


38.   He said that a liberal construction was required  by  Metock  and  the
    ECJ had ignored the limitations which may be  inherent  in  the  phrase
    "accompanies or joins".  It was clearly not necessary for there  to  be
    pre-existing cohabitation within the EEA.

39.   Another argument in favour of a liberal interpretation  was  the  very
    fact  that  bad  faith  was  considered  an  irrelevant  consideration.
    Notwithstanding the fact that there may be a case for recognising abuse
    of rights or fraud, such as marriages of convenience, nevertheless good
    faith was not a necessary requirement in order to  benefit  under  this
    Directive.

40.   Mr Scannell analysed in detail Buxton LJ's judgement  in  KG  and  AK.
    In a superficially seductive analysis, he submitted that nearly all  of
    Buxton  LJ's  reasoning  had  been  undermined  and  overruled  by  the
    reasoning in Metock.  He urged us to accept  his  conclusion  that  the
    Court of Appeal judgement was now untenable in the light of Metock  and
    either to allow the appeal following the reasoning in Metock  which  he
    reminded us he considered to be binding upon us, or to make a reference
    to the ECJ on point.

41.   In reply Mr Sharland asked us to reject Mr Scannell's  arguments  that
    Metock was binding on the Tribunal on this point.  Metock did not  deal
    with the application of Article 3(2)(a);  KG  and  AK  did.   Therefore
    there was no clash between the two cases.  It was the Court  of  Appeal
    case of KG and AK which was on  point  and  therefore  binding  on  us.
    Whilst the European Court of Justice is a  higher  authority  than  the
    Court of Appeal, Metock was not on all fours with the appeal before us,
    and was, at best, merely persuasive.

42.   With regard to Mr Scannell's submission that we might consider  making
    a reference to the ECJ, Mr Sharland reminded us that Buxton LJ had been
    far from resolute in his opinion.  He had merely formed  a  preliminary
    view in which he had used  words  such  as  "inclined"  and  "might  be
    necessary".   Paragraph  82  was  not  a  definitive  and   unequivocal
    endorsement of the need to make a reference in the situation  in  which
    the Tribunal finds itself in this appeal.

43.   He said paragraph 4 of Metock set out some  of  the  recitals  to  the
    preamble to the Directive.  It only referred to recitals 1, 5,  11,  14
    and 31.  It omitted recitals to 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.   It  is  recital  6
    which refers to Article 3(2)(a).  Metock  had  not  considered  Article
    3(2)(a).

44.   The appellant in this appeal is unable to benefit from  the  reasoning
    in Metock as he is not a family member.  It is clear that "other family
    members" is a term of art  and  constitutes  a  different  category  of
    beneficiaries from those in the core family member group referred to in
    Article 2 and considered in Metock.  Had it been intended to include in
    those beneficiaries, "other family members", the Directive  would  have
    provided unequivocally for that.

45.   Mr Sharland invited  us  to  observe  the  contrast  in  the  preamble
    between family members who have  automatic  rights,  and  other  family
    members, who are to be examined on the basis of  national  legislation.
    The applicability of national legislation was a crucial  consideration.



46.   Mr Scannell had argued that Metock applied to "other  family  members"
    but Mr Sharland invited us to take note of the fact that  the  ECJ  had
    not said so specifically and argued that if the ECJ had intended  their
    reasoning to be of wider applicability, there is  no  doubt  that  they
    would have made that plain.

47.   Mr Sharland referred to the ECJ's response to the submissions made  by
    a number of member states that a liberal interpretation would  increase
    the number of beneficiaries able to enjoy a right of  residence  within
    the Community.

48.   At paragraph 73 the ECJ said:

        "73.     On this point, the answer must be, first, that it  is  not
             all nationals of non-member  countries  who  derive  rights  of
             entry into and residence  in  a  Member  State  from  Directive
             2004/38, but only those who  are  family  members,  within  the
             meaning of point 2 of Article 2 of that directive, of  a  Union
             citizen who has exercised his right of freedom of  movement  by
             becoming established in a Member State other  than  the  Member
             State of which he is a national."

49.   It was Mr Sharland's contention that paragraph 73 explicitly  excluded
    other family members, and that if we were to be satisfied  that  Metock
    was of limited applicability, and excluded other family  members,  then
    Mr Scannell's arguments failed.

50.   Mr Scannell's argument about Akrich was not persuasive in that  Akrich
    dealt with the rights of a spouse whereas this appeal  related  to  the
    rights of an  "other  family  member".   Paragraph  58  of  Metock  was
    deliberately narrow and applied only to  spouses.   It  had  considered
    only paragraphs 50 and 51 of Akrich and cannot  support  Mr  Scannell's
    wider interpretation that the whole of Akrich has been overruled.

51.   Mr Sharland invited us to conclude that the  underlying  rationale  of
    Metock was set out in paragraph 70:

        "70.     .... Directive 2004/38 confers on all  nationals  of  non-
             member countries who are family  members  of  a  Union  citizen
             within the meaning of point 2 of Article 2 of  that  directive,
             and accompany or join the Union citizen in a Member State other
             than that of which he is a national, rights of entry  into  and
             residence in the host Member State, regardless of  whether  the
             national of a non-member  country  has  already  been  lawfully
             resident in another Member State. "


52.   It was Mr Sharland's submission that the paragraph set out the  limits
    of the ECJ judgement.

53.   In a nutshell Mr Sharland submitted that KG and AK was still  good  in
    relation to Article 3(2) namely "other family members".

Conclusion

54.    Despite  the  complexity  of  the  regulations  themselves  and   the
    jurisprudence, both domestic and European, the issue is indeed a simple
    one.  Essentially the issue for us to decide is whether the phrase  "in
    the country from which they have come" in Article 3(2)  is  limited  to
    EEA states.  There is no dispute that the appellant is not entitled  to
    a residence card under the Regulations because  he  cannot  fulfil  the
    criteria in paragraph 8(2)(b) or (c) of the 2006 Regulations.

55.   The issue is whether or not the appellant can  benefit  under  Article
    3(2) of the Citizens' Directive.

56.   We were assisted by the lead judgement given by Buxton LJ  in  KG  and
    AK.  We accept Mr  Sharland's  argument  that  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    decision is precisely on point.  Buxton LJ said:

        "64.     If therefore  we  turn  to  the  construction  of  article
             3(2)(a), the general issue common  to  both  appeals  which  we
             identified in �2 above is whether the provision that OFM [other
             family members]  have  to  be  dependants  or  members  of  the
             household of the Union citizen "in the country from which  they
             have come" means, as Regulation  8(2)(a)  provides,  that  "the
             country" has to be the EEA state in  which  the  Union  citizen
             also resides.


          1. The basic point can be put quite  shortly.  No  family  members
             have rights of residence unless the Union citizen exercises his
             own right to move to or reside in a member state of which he is
             not a national. Article 3.1 of Directive 2004/38 provides  that
             article 2 family members obtain the benefit of the Directive if
             they accompany  or  join  such  Union  citizens.  Although  not
             specifically so stated, it is hardly likely that  an  OFM  will
             not be also so required  to  be  accompanying  or  joining  his
             relevant Union citizen.  The  tight  relationship  between  the
             exercise of rights by the Union  citizen  and  the  requirement
             that the OFMs accompanying or joining him should have been  his
             dependants or members of his  household  in  the  country  from
             which  they  have  come  very  strongly  suggests   that   that
             relationship should have existed in the country from which  the
             Union citizen has  come,  and  thus  have  existed  immediately
             before the Union citizen was accompanied or joined by the  OFM.
             It seems wholly unlikely that when article 10(2) of  Regulation
             1612/68 and article 3(2)(a) of Directive 2004/38 introduce  the
             requirement of dependence on and membership of the household of
             the Union citizen in the country from which the OFM  has  come,
             they can have had in mind anything other than dependence on the
             Union citizen in the country movement from which by  the  Union
             citizen is the whole basis of  his  rights  and,  thus  of  the
             rights of the OFM.


          1. That consideration is reinforced not only  by  the  requirement
             that the OFM must be accompanying or joining the Union citizen,
             but also by the justification for ancillary rights of  movement
             in terms of not deterring the Union citizen from exercising the
             primary right (see �60 above).  The  analysis  of  the  ECJ  in
             Akrich addressed actual but unlawful  presence  of  the  family
             member in the original member state. But the argument that "the
             country" in article 3(2)(a) means any country at  all,  whether
             or not the Union citizen is there  at  the  time  of  movement,
             assumes that the OFM rules will extend to cases where  the  OFM
             is not present in  the  original  member  state  at  all,  even
             unlawfully. It is hard to see how the  Union  citizen  will  be
             deterred from exercising his right  to  move  from  one  member
             state to another by the prospect of not being able to take with
             him an OFM who was once, in another state, but is  not  now,  a
             member of his household.


          1. So far so good. But  the  argument  goes  no  further  than  to
             establish that in order to exercise an OFM's  ancillary  rights
             the dependence or membership of household must be in  the  same
             country as  that  from  which  the  Union  citizen  is  moving.
             Regulation 8(2)(a) however requires the  OFM  to  have  been  a
             dependant or a member of the household of the Union citizen  in
             the EEA state in which the Union citizen resides.


          1. In most cases, including those addressed in these appeals,  the
             country relevant to the rights of the Union citizen will indeed
             be a  member  state,  because  his  rights  will  be  based  on
             movement, which the jurisprudence indicates  will  normally  be
             movement within the Community. That however leaves the  so  far
             unresolved position of the Union citizen who wishes to enter  a
             member state other than his own, being a person who  has  never
             lived in his own member state, or has lived in a third  country
             for a substantial period of time: see �� 29-31 above. The  most
             that can be said about  the  impact  of  such  cases  is  that,
             provided Community law sees the need to accommodate them  under
             the freedoms of movement of Union citizen, they would undermine
             the position of  Regulation  8(2)(a)  in  interpreting  article
             3(2)(a) of Directive 2004/38 as  requiring  "the  country  from
             which they have come" as necessarily being an EEA state."


57.   We have been persuaded by Mr Sharland that the facts in KG and AK  and
    the appeal before us are similar.  The appellant did  not  reside  with
    the sponsor, a second cousin, in an EEA state prior to his  application
    for residence.

58.   We rejected Mr Sharland's argument that the issue  of  dependency  can
    be re-opened and therefore  have  not  considered  the  factual  issues
    relating to dependency.

59.   We have dealt with Mr Scannell's submission  that  KG  and  AK  is  no
    longer good law since the decision of the Grand Chamber of the  ECJ  in
    Metock.

60.   The issue in Metock concerned the rights of a  spouse.   It  is  clear
    from a careful reading of the judgement that it related specifically to
    the position with regard to spouses.  It follows that Article 2(2)  and
    3(1) of the Directive were at the heart of that appeal and not  Article
    3(2), which is central to the appeal before us.  We are satisfied  that
    the rights conferred on "core" family members in Article  2(2)  of  the
    Directive and those conferred on "other family members" in Article 3(2)
    are wholly different in scope.  Whilst  we  acknowledge  the  rationale
    that Union citizens must not be discouraged from moving  freely  within
    the Community and that it may be necessary for them to be able to  have
    their core family members with them, it cannot be argued that  extended
    or other family members are in the same category.   The  directive  and
    indeed the reasoning in Metock make it clear in our view that there  is
    the world of difference between  a  core  "family  member"  and  "other
    family members".  In our view paragraph 73 of Metock encapsulates  this
    reasoning:

        "73.     On this point, the answer must be, first, that it  is  not
             all nationals of non-member  countries  who  derive  rights  of
             entry into and residence  in  a  Member  State  from  Directive
             2004/38, but only those who  are  family  members,  within  the
             meaning of point 2 of Article 2 of that directive, of  a  Union
             citizen who has exercised his right of freedom of  movement  by
             becoming established in a Member State other  than  the  Member
             State of which he is a national."

61.    That  underlines,  with  unequivocal   clarity,   that   Metock   was
    considering the rights of family members as  defined  in  Article  2(2)
    rather than "other family members" such as the appellant in this  case.
    The phrase "in the country from which they have come" does not apply to
    spouses as it does not appear  in  Article  2  and  therefore  was  not
    considered in Metock.

62.   Accordingly the Tribunal  considers  itself  bound  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal's decision in KG and AK; as Metock determines the situation with
    regard to a spouse  rather  than  "other  family  members"  we  do  not
    consider ourselves bound by the ECJ judgement.

63.   With regard to Mr Scannell's argument that we should  consider  making
    a  reference  to  the  ECJ,  we  do  not  consider  that  Buxton   LJ's
    observations at paragraph 82 of KG and AK oblige us to do so.  There is
    no ambiguity in the situation  here.   With  regard  to  "other  family
    members" of whom the appellant is one, there  is  no  lack  of  clarity
    which would benefit from a reference to the ECJ.

64.   For the above reasons we are of the view that the Immigration  Judge's
    decision was materially flawed in law and that  the  appellant  is  not
    entitled to a residence card.


Decision

65.    Accordingly,  as  there  was  a  material  error  of   law   in   the
    determination, the following decision is substituted.

66.   The appeal is dismissed.
