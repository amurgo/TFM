Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Powell) dismissing the appellant's  appeal  against  a  decision
    taken on 24 December 2014 to refuse to grant further leave to remain as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of India born  in  1982.  He  was  variously
    granted leave to enter and remain as a student from 6 January  2009  to
    27 April 2013. He submitted an application on 24 April 2013 for a  visa
    following his enrolment at Grenville College, London. The college  lost
    its licence and on 18  September  2014  the  respondent  wrote  to  the
    appellant giving him 60 calendar days to find an  alternative  college.
    He then obtained a conditional offer of a place at Unipro  College  but
    needed to take an additional English test. He did not have his original
    passport and so was not allowed to sit the test booked on  14  February
    2015. He paid ï¿½2000 to Unipro  College  which  was  not  refunded.  The
    appellant claims that his representatives, ACM, wrote to the respondent
    on 20 November 2014 enclosing the conditional offer from Unipro College
    and advising that the college would issue a CAS once  he  had  obtained
    his IELTS test certificate. His test was cancelled and ACM wrote  again
    to the respondent requesting the return of his original passport.

 4. The Secretary  of  State  did  not  accept  that  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX(c) were met because the CAS submitted was  assigned  by
    Grenville College and that college was not listed as a Tier  4  sponsor
    as of 19 December 2014. No  valid  CAS  had  been  submitted  with  the
    application.

The Appeal

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an  oral
    hearing at Newport on 15 September  2015.  He  was  represented  by  Ms
    Vatish, Counsel. The First-tier Tribunal found that the letter dated 20
    November 2014 did not request the return of the  original  passport  or
    complain about any delay in doing so. Nor did it state that  Unipro  or
    any other body were not prepared to accept the certified copy which had
    been provided. No further  letter  from  ACM  could  be  found  on  the
    respondent's file.  The  letter  of  20  November  2014  had  not  been
    responded to but  that  was  not  the  normal  approach  taken  by  the
    respondent. Nor was it the cause of the appellant's difficulty  because
    there was no request for the passport to  be  returned.  There  was  no
    direct evidence that the absence of the original  passport  caused  the
    appellant to be unable to take the language test.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law by failing to  make
    clear credibility findings and findings in  respect  of  the  documents
    submitted by the appellant. The judge failed to apply  the  common  law
    principle of fairness. The appellant had  found  himself  to  be  in  a
    predicament and the remedy lay with the respondent but they failed even
    to respond. The judge had failed to appreciate  that  tighter  measures
    might be in place as a result of the  ETS/TOEIC  scandal  and  original
    passports were required.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Judge  Cruthers  on  2
    February 2016. The crux of the appellant's case was  that  he  was  not
    able to take an English language test because all  test  providers  now
    require the candidate's original passport and the respondent would  not
    release it to him. It was arguable that the judge  had  not  adequately
    dealt with  the  argument  that  in  those  circumstances  the  refusal
    breached principles of fairness.

 8. In a rule 24 response dated 5 February 2016  the  respondent  submitted
    that the judge had not materially erred in law. At paragraph  15(K)  it
    was accepted by the appellant that the e-mails refusing him entry  were
    after the refusal. At paragraphs 20 and 28, the judge  did  not  accept
    that the letter from ACM requested the passport to be returned  to  the
    appellant. At paragraph 33 of the decision, the judge  did  not  accept
    the appellant's enquiries with universities about taking  the  language
    test without his original passport were genuine because he was  already
    out of time by that stage.

 9. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

10. Ms Litchfield submitted that  the  appellant  needed  time  to  sit  an
    English test and the letter of 20  November  2014  requested  that  the
    decision should be held until he had sat the test. The appeal is  based
    on the fact that the respondent should have returned the passport.  The
    judge found that  there  was  no  request  for  the  passport  but  the
    respondent knew that the appellant could not take the test without  the
    original passport.  There was no response from the  respondent  to  the
    letter of 20 November 2014 and the respondent then unfairly refused the
    application on 24 December 2014. The exam was not too far in the future
    and the application was refused unfairly. The unfairness issue was  not
    adequately dealt with at paragraph 38 of the decision because the  lack
    of response from the respondent did cause the appellant difficulty. The
    judge did not adequately deal with that issue - just  saying  that  was
    not the normal approach. The appellant has still not been able to  take
    the English language test because the exam centres will  not  accept  a
    certified copy of the passport and the respondent has  the  appellant's
    passport.

11. Mr Kandola submitted that there was  no  material  error  of  law.  The
    fairness issue was dealt with at  paragraphs  11-12  of  the  decision.
    There had already been numerous 60 day extensions. The appellant should
    have got back to the respondent with a CAS by November 2014.  The  test
    was not booked until February 2015. The  appellant  was  asking  for  a
    fourth 60 day extension. The judge dealt with the  chronology  and  the
    fairness of the application. At paragraph 20 of the decision the  judge
    found  that  there  was  no  request  for  the  passport.  This  was  a
    comprehensive decision for a simple student matter.

12. Mr Kandola confirmed that it was not apparent from the file whether the
    caseworker was aware of the letter of 20 November  2014.  The  decision
    was put on hold in September 2014 and  then  reviewed  on  24  November
    2014. There was a further hold until 8  December  2014  when  documents
    were linked to the file, documents were  awaited  on  9  December  2014
    which were linked on 15 December 2014  and  then  the  application  was
    refused on 24 December 2014.

13. Ms Litchfield submitted in reply that the test  was  booked  before  20
    February 2015 but that was the earliest date that the  appellant  could
    sit the language test. The issue was not whether Unipro  College  would
    accept certified copies  but  whether  the  exam  centre  would  accept
    certified copies. The IELTS application form says that candidates  must
    have a current passport to prove identity. Other e-mails say that  only
    the original passport would be accepted. The  appellant  says  that  he
    telephoned the respondent to ask for the original passport but there is
    no documentary evidence to support that claim.

14. I am satisfied that the findings at paragraphs 29-37  of  the  decision
    were properly open to the judge. However, the key issue in this  appeal
    is the letter from ACM dated 20  November  2014.  The  judge  correctly
    identified at paragraph 38 of the decision that the letter contained no
    request for the original passport to be returned. However,  the  letter
    did confirm that the language test was booked for 14 February 2015  and
    requested that the decision should be held until the  English  language
    certificate and new CAS had been submitted to  the  respondent.  It  is
    common ground that the respondent failed to respond to the  letter  and
    there is no mention of the letter in the refusal decision. There is  no
    evidence on the respondent's file that the letter was ever considered.

15. I have considered Patel (consideration of Sapkota -  unfairness)  India
    [2011] UKUT 00484 (IAC) and Thakur (PBS decision - common law fairness)
    Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00151 (IAC). I find that the failure to consider
    and respond to the letter of 20 November 2014 amounted to a  breach  of
    the common law duty of fairness, in  the  particular  circumstances  of
    this case. There was no obligation on the respondent to accede  to  the
    request for the decision to be held but  there  was  an  obligation  to
    consider the request to hold the decision until after 14 February  2015
    and to evidence the reasons for rejecting the request and refusing  the
    application  without  further  evidence.  The  judgement  is  generally
    thorough and carefully considered but I accept the submission that  the
    common law duty of fairness was not adequately considered at  paragraph
    38. That is a material error of law.

16. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Immigration Rules involved the making of an  error  of
    law and its decision cannot stand.



Decision

17. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    remake the decision by allowing the appeal to the extent that no  valid
    decision has yet been made in respect of the  appellant's  application.
    The respondent must now make  a  fresh  decision  in  due  course.  The
    respondent should give  proper  consideration  to  the  possibility  of
    returning the original passport to the appellant to enable him to  take
    the English language test  and  submit  a  new  CAS  before  the  fresh
    decision is made.
