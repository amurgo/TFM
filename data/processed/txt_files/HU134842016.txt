                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision
         of the First-tier Tribunal of 25 October 2017 to allow  the  appeal
         of Donald Adolphus Gabbidon, a citizen of  Jamaica  born  7  August
         1951, itself brought against the decision of the Secretary of State
         of 13 May 2016 to refuse his human rights claim.




    Introduction

      2. Mr Gabbidon entered the country on a one month visitor visa  on  21
         December 2000, and made an application on private and  family  life
         grounds on 7 July 2012. That was refused on 9 August 2013,  without
         a right of appeal; he  requested  reconsideration  on  12  November
         2013. On 10 March  2015  he  was  notified  of  his  status  as  an
         overstayer and served with liability to removal on 8 March 2016.

      3.  Mr  Gabbidon's  application  of  5  May  2016  was  based  on  his
         relationship with his natural children Worezero Naomi,  Donald  and
         Miguel, and his stepchildren,  and  their  grandchildren,  who  all
         lived in this country. He  claimed  that  whereas  in  the  UK  the
         support they provided was central to meeting  his  care  needs,  he
         would have no  family  members  to  support  him  in  Jamaica,  any
         relatives having moved to the US, Canada and the  UK,  and  lacking
         any other community ties; he had no  accommodation  there;  he  was
         prone to falls and needed supervision  when  using  the  toilet  at
         night.  He  suffered  from  facial  disfigurement  and   only   his
         grandchildren's encouragement prevented him from  remaining  locked
         in his room. His daughter was his main carer. His grandson read the
         newspaper to him regularly.

      4. The application was refused, on the basis that he was not  suitable
         for the private life route having failed  to  pay  outstanding  NHS
         charges, and as it was not accepted that he had no extended  family
         members or friends in Jamaica, albeit  that  it  was  accepted  his
         close family were in this country. His family here would be able to
         accompany him to Jamaica to help him settle  in  and  organise  any
         necessary care arrangements. There were stroke  rehabilitation  and
         care units in Jamaica according to a  MedCOI  response  of  January
         2013 referring to the Hyacinth Lightbourne Memorial Association and
         the University Hospital of the West Indies, and the  Rehabilitation
         Institute of the  Caribbean.  He  was  not  facing  imminent  death
         without medical care given his condition in the  aftermath  of  his
         stroke was neither terminal nor life-threatening.

    Findings of the First-tier Tribunal

      5.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  noted  Mr  Gabbidon  had  a  very  poor
         immigration history, entering the UK around fifteen years ago as  a
         visitor and then overstaying. It was accepted his claim  could  not
         succeed under the Immigration Rules.

      6. The critical feature of his case was his medical condition. He  had
         suffered  a  stroke.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  observed  him   in
         evidence, and evaluated  his  presentation  in  the  light  of  the
         written reports closely, noting that he had a mental as well  as  a
         physical condition. He was paralysed down his right side and  could
         not lift his right arm; he had  a  slight  tick  and  found  speech
         occasionally difficult. Overall his presentation, in the  light  of
         the other material, was generally not  something  which  could  not
         reasonably be thought contrived. Lewisham Social Services  and  his
         GP considered he had suffered mental damage which had not recovered
         as well as his  physical  health;  it  was  self-evident  that  his
         recovery from his stroke was not complete, because even some  three
         years on he still suffered from significant physical  disabilities.
         It was important to  note  that  emotional  intelligence  would  be
         particularly important in his declining years, even  more  so  than
         reasoning intelligence.

      7. The evidence from his children was that  there  was  no  family  to
         support him in Jamaica, and any care home that  they  could  afford
         would not be of  a  reasonable  standard.  He  required  one-to-one
         support for his health. Applying the staged approach identified  in
         Razgar, he had established family life given his dependency on  his
         children and his relationships with them and his grandchildren.  It
         was disproportionate to remove him from this family, and  from  his
         friends. The public policy issues formed by the legitimate  aim  of
         maintaining the rule of law and the UK's  economic  interests  were
         outweighed by these considerations.

    Onwards appeal, including the "error of law" hearing

      8. The Secretary of State appealed on the basis that the  Respondent's
         claim would not have passed the Article 3 threshold  and  in  those
         circumstances the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  in  failing
         to demonstrate any aspect of the  Appellant's  claim  which  showed
         some separate or additional factual element, via  the  capacity  to
         form and enjoy relationships, that brought it within the Article  8
         paradigm. There was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that
         appropriate medical treatment could not be accessed in Jamaica, and
         the Tribunal had not made findings on  the  Appellant's  degree  of
         dependency on his family in the  UK  (and  thus  had  not  properly
         equipped itself to determine whether there was additional emotional
         dependency beyond the norm, as required by Kugathas), or  upon  the
         level of care required.

      9. The First-tier Tribunal granted  permission  to  appeal  generally,
         specifically opining that the decision was seemingly at  odds  with
         GS (India).

     10. Ms Willock-Briscoe submitted that there was no reasoned  engagement
         with the section 117B factors nor with the adult dependent relative
         route  as  an  appropriate  benchmark  against  which  to   measure
         proportionality. Furthermore the evidence upon which the First-tier
         Tribunal based its conclusions was not set out. As set  out  in  MM
         (Zimbabwe) [2017]  EWCA  Civ  797,  it  was  essential  to  clearly
         indicate what element of private and family life was relied  on  to
         differentiate a case  with  a  health  dimension  from  the  normal
         Article 3  ECHR  paradigm  which  recognised  only  imminent  death
         without palliative care as sufficient. She also filed a 152A Notice
         requesting that, were an error of law to be established,  that  any
         reconsideration  of  the  case  take  account  of  a  caution   for
         mistreating a child in April 2014 be taken into account.

     11. For Mr Gabbidon, Ms  Appiah  conducted  a  close  analysis  of  the
         evidence and argued that all  relevant  factors  had  been  clearly
         identified by the judge,  and  that  his  failure  to  engage  with
         section 117B was a minor failing that was not material.

Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

     12. The essential finding of the First-tier Tribunal in this appeal was
         that the Respondent enjoyed close family life  with  those  of  his
         children who were directly involved with meeting his extensive care
         needs. It would not require very significant interpolation into the
         Tribunal's reasoning  to  read  the  decision  as  amounting  to  a
         conclusion that the removal  of  a  person  with  significant  care
         needs, presently provided by their immediate  family  and  with  no
         close  relatives  abroad  who  could  replace   that   regime,   is
         disproportionate. Such a conclusion might well be  unexceptionable.
         However it needs to be reached via a structured consideration  that
         has regard to the  legal  framework  endorsed  by  Parliament.  The
         question this appeal  raises  is  whether  it  received  sufficient
         consideration by the First-tier Tribunal.

     13. The Secretary of State attacked the favourable  finding  on  family
         life. The decision of the Strasbourg Court in Advic v UK (1995)  20
         EHRR CD 125 is sometimes cited for the proposition that the  normal
         emotional ties between a parent and an adult son or  daughter  will
         not, without more, suffice  to  constitute  family  life:  Kugathas
         [2003] EWCA Civ 31. Buxton LJ emphasised in  MT  (Zimbabwe)  [2007]
         EWCA Civ 455 at [11] that Advic, "whilst stressing the need for  an
         element of dependency over and above the normal between that  of  a
         parent or  parent  figure  and  adult  child,  also  stresses  that
         everything depends on the circumstances of each  case".  The  Upper
         Tribunal President wrote in Lama [2017] UKUT 16 (IAC) �32 that  "at
         its heart, family life denotes real or committed  personal  support
         between or among the persons concerned."

     14. Health problems may of course be highly relevant to the  degree  of
         dependency a migrant has  upon  their  family  here.  As  noted  by
         Underhill LJ in GS India [2015] EWCA Civ 40 �111, "where article  8
         is engaged  by  other  factors,  the  fact  that  the  claimant  is
         receiving medical treatment  in  this  country  which  may  not  be
         available in  the  country  of  return  may  be  a  factor  in  the
         proportionality exercise; but that factor cannot be treated  as  by
         itself giving rise to a breach since that would contravene the  "no
         obligation to treat" principle." Alongside him, Laws LJ wrote  �86:
         "If the Article 3 claim fails ... Article 8 cannot prosper  without
         some separate or additional factual element which brings  the  case
         within the Article 8 paradigm - the  capacity  to  form  and  enjoy
         relationships - or a state of affairs having some affinity with the
         paradigm."

     15. A mixed family and private life claim, as where a parent is heavily
         dependent on their adult children for emotional as well as physical
         support,  might  satisfy  that  threshold:  as  was  noted  in   MM
         (Zimbabwe) [2012] EWCA Civ 279 at [23], where "the appellant  ha[s]
         established firm family ties in this country, then the availability
         of continuing medical treatment here, coupled with  his  dependence
         on the family here for support, [may] together  establish  'private
         life' under Article 8 ...  Such a  finding  would  not  offend  the
         principle ... that  the  United  Kingdom  is  under  no  Convention
         obligation to  provide  medical  treatment  here  when  it  is  not
         available in the country to which the appellant is to be deported."



     16. It seems to me that the  First-tier  Tribunal  effectively  applied
         these  considerations,  albeit  it  did  not  cite   the   relevant
         authorities; its reference of Huang shows that it was aware of  the
         proposition that extended life outside the  family  unit  for  some
         individuals can seriously inhibit their personal development.

     17. However, the other grounds of appeal  have  rather  more  traction.
         This was an appeal considered outside the scope of the  Immigration
         Rules. As stated by Lord Carnwath and Lady  Hale  in  MM  (Lebanon)
         [2017] UKSC 10 �66, it is now generally  accepted  that  Article  8
         considerations cannot be "fitted into a rigid template provided  by
         the rules, so as in effect to exclude consideration by the tribunal
         of special cases outside the rules ... this would be a negation  of
         the evaluative exercise required in assessing  the  proportionality
         of a measure under article 8 of the Convention which  excludes  any
         'hard-edged or bright-line rule to be applied to the generality  of
         cases'".

     18. However, the ability of a case to succeed outside the Rules'  rigid
         template does  not  mean  that  there  is  not  a  certain  minimum
         threshold to reach: hence the shorthand requirement  for  something
         "compelling", and it is necessary to follow  through  a  structured
         assessment in order to come to a lawful conclusion to such  effect.
         One notable feature of the decision below is the extreme brevity of
         the treatment of section 117B. The Upper Tribunal stated in  Forman
         [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC) that:

         "In cases where the provisions of sections 117B-117C  of  the  2002
         Act arise, the decision of the Tribunal must demonstrate that  they
         have been given full effect."

     19. In Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803  �45,  Sales  LJ  noted  that  "the
         starting point for consideration of the proper construction of Part
         5A of the 2002 Act is that sections 117A-117D, taken together,  are
         intended to provide for a structured approach to the application of
         Article 8 which produces in all  cases  a  final  result  which  is
         compatible with, and not in violation of, Article 8."

     20. The key considerations identified  by  section  117B  are  language
         proficiency, precariousness of immigration  status,  and  financial
         independence. It may well be  the  case  that  the  Respondent  has
         English as his first language, so that there was very little to  be
         said on that  score.  However,  there  was  significantly  more  to
         discuss vis-�-vis the precariousness of his immigration status, and
         his financial independence.

     21.  The  Respondent  entered  the  country  as  a  visitor  and   then
         egregiously overstayed his leave. Clearly that counted against him.
         It would also appear  that  he  had  had  significant  recourse  to
         Lewisham social services and to the NHS, and indeed  had  left  NHS
         fees unpaid in the past. It was very unlikely that  he  would  ever
         work again. So the factors mandated by Parliament required  careful
         treatment in order to determine whether there was a compelling case
         to overcome them based on the extent of  the  Respondent's  private
         and family life ties in the UK.  The correct approach in  a  health
         case, as shown by Akhalu [2013] UKUT 400 (IAC) addressing questions
         of Article 8, proportionality and health, is not to  leave  out  of
         account the financial dimension of such a case: it is essential  to
         recognise that the countervailing public interest in  removal  will
         outweigh the consequences for the health of the claimant because of
         a disparity of health care facilities in all but a  very  few  rare
         cases.

     22. I concluded, given the succinctness of the  reasoning  below,  that
         there was no adequate assessment of the  relevant  public  interest
         factors given the complexity of the factors in play.

     23. Furthermore, there are of course Immigration  Rules  which  address
         the circumstances of dependent relatives. An application made  from
         abroad in the Respondent's circumstances would, had  it  been  duly
         made under the Rules, have had  to  demonstrate  that  he  required
         "long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks"  due  to  "age,
         illness or disability"; and that such care must  not  be  available
         "in the country where they are living" because it is not  available
         in the sense that there is nobody who can reasonably be expected to
         provide it, or it is  unaffordable.  The  latter  aspects  of  that
         enquiry were dealt with very scantily here:  it  was  unclear  what
         healthcare would be available in Jamaica or  indeed  whether  there
         were relatives there who might help the Respondent access it.

     24. So though I accepted that the findings of the  First-tier  Tribunal
         as to there being extant family life were unassailable  (indeed  it
         appears that this was not contested below), I considered that  more
         factual assessment of the alternative arrangements that might  have
         been available in Jamaica was  desirable.  The  strictures  of  the
         adult dependent relative route were a potential reference point  in
         assessing the difference between  the  care  arrangements  in  this
         country and abroad.

     25. Those strictures are  not  insurmountable,  but  require  objective
         assessment, as explained by Sir Terence  Etherton  MR  in  Britcits
         [2017] EWCA Civ 368 �59, who pointed out that it would be necessary
         to  weigh  the  accessibility  and  geographical  location  of  the
         provision of care and its standard, having regard to its  emotional
         and  psychological  elements,  verified  by   appropriate   medical
         evidence.

     26. I accordingly found that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         could not stand. As the fact-finding remaining  was  of  relatively
         narrow compass though the legal issues were relatively complex,  it
         was appropriate to retain the appeal in the Upper Tribunal.



Evidence at the Continuation hearing

     27. It is now appropriate to set out the evidence that  was  previously
         before the First-tier Tribunal, and the additional evidence  before
         me, in more detail. This included

          a) A letter from Dr Batra, Mr Gabbidon's GP,  confirming  he  had
             suffered a stroke on  30  April  2014,  stating  it  would  be
             difficult for Mr Gabbidon to look after  himself  without  the
             help of his family.

          b) A series  of  Care  Act  Overview  Assessments  from  Lewisham
             Borough, from 2014 onwards. The first stated that he  received
             long and short-term  physical  care  support,  at  a  critical
             eligibility level, due to his post-stroke right side weakness,
             poor mobility and balance, which left him prone to falls, such
             that he required the assistance of  a  formal  carer,  a  role
             performed by his daughter Naomi, who  assisted  him  with  his
             personal hygiene and in maintaining  a  habitable  environment
             where he could get around the home safely (a Link Line service
             had been established). It appeared he  could  cognitively  and
             physically maintain  his  personal  appearance  independently,
             though he was not left at home for more than an hour.  He  had
             memory difficulties, and required prompting with medication; a
             January 2016 assessment stated that his  physical  health  had
             been reported as  having  improved,  and  that  he  could  now
             express himself better, though he sometimes struggled to  find
             the right words; he could use the stairs  in  their  block  of
             flats, though he walked slowly  indoors,  remaining  prone  to
             falls due to a dropped right foot. He  nevertheless  continued
             to require a formal carer's help with washing because  of  his
             history of falls and his ongoing right  side  weakness,  Naomi
             helping him with  cooking,  and  reminding  him  to  take  his
             medication.

          c) Various birth certificates, for the Appellant's  grandchildren
             in the  UK,  and  documents  recording  the  registration  and
             naturalisation of his children.

          d) A joint letter, written by Romario, but signed by  various  of
             the Appellant's grandchildren stating  that  Mr  Gabbidon  had
             cared for them whilst their parents had worked  following  his
             original arrival in the UK, and that they had all subsequently
             been greatly saddened when they felt that their  grandfather's
             state of health might threaten his life. Romario felt that his
             own schoolwork was affected by the worry he had about his sick
             and disabled grandfather facing return to Jamaica  where  they
             could not afford to visit him.

          e) A letter of January 2019 explaining that attempts to obtain an
             independent  social  worker  had  foundered  because   of   an
             inability to fund the report.

          f) A Residents' checklist from the Home for the Aged,  St  Mary's
             District, Munro, St Elizabeth, bearing a handwritten note from
             one Roy Colmore Cuttleton stating that the starting point  for
             fees was $40,000 monthly,  with  medical  visits  each  costng
             $3,000; a letter  from  JF  Law  stated  that  this  had  been
             obtained following a visit by the instructing solicitor whilst
             on holiday there.

     28. The Appellant's witness statement set out that he had lived in  the
         UK for over 15 years. He had nobody to support him in Jamaica. Here
         his children and grandchildren helped him; theywere all he had left
         in this world.

     29. A witness statement from the  Appellant's  daughter  Woizero  Naomi
         Gabbidon states that she resided with the Appellant, and  had  been
         his main carer, since his stroke in 2014. Her teenage son, who  saw
         the Appellant as  a  father  figure,  also  helped  her.  She,  her
         siblings and children all gave the Appellant emotional support. Her
         son stayed with him whenever Naomi was at college. They  and  their
         solicitor had sought a social work report but could not afford one.
         They had nobody to help care for their father in Jamaica and  could
         not afford a nursing home. He needed help to take his medication as
         he was forgetful and confused, and his speech was  not  good;  this
         would all be exacerbated if he had to live apart  from  his  family
         members. He found medical treatment difficult, as he had  a  needle
         phobia, requiring individualised treatment from a nurse.  He  could
         not use a computer, email or a smart phone. The family  here  could
         not afford to pay for a care home in  Jamaica,  and  even  if  they
         could,  he  could  not  survive  there  for  long.  They  had  many
         commitments in the UK; here together they could meet his needs.  He
         spent a lot of time with his different  relatives  here,  including
         her and her brother, in between the thrice daily care visits.

     30. A witness statement from the Appellant's son Miguel Gabbidon was in
         similar terms. He feared for another  recurrence  of  his  father's
         original stroke. They took turns to visit him and take him  to  the
         barbers, and to lift his mood by playing dominoes. He believed  his
         father's condition would deteriorate without his family to care for
         him.

     31. Naomi Gabbidon gave evidence. She received income by way  of  child
         benefits for her two young children, income support and tax credit.
         She had three children, of whom two were dependent on her. She  had
         around �20 spare income a month.  Neither  the  costs  of  care  in
         Jamaica nor travel costs could not be afforded from this figure.

     32. Cross examined, she said that the quote obtained from the care home
         in Jamaica came from a person working there.  She  understood  that
         her solicitor had obtained the figures. At this point, Ms  Lanlehan
         intervened to say  that  she  understood  that  the  solicitor  had
         visited Jamaica to obtain this information; the manuscript note had
         been written by the care home's employee with whom he spoke. It was
         put to Ms Gabbidon that $40,000 Jamaican dollars equated  to  �300-
         �400 monthly. She said that the family as a whole could not put  up
         these sums of money; as it was  they  scraped  together  what  they
         could in order to support the Appellant here. She had last been  to
         Jamaica in 2013, with her friend Shyene  Graham,  and  they  stayed
         with a friend of Naomi there. It was put to  her  that  her  father
         would be wholly reliant on the State if he remained here; she  said
         that this was not necessarily the case, given that both she and the
         other family members would do everything they could to help him  in
         any way possible.

     33. Miguel Gabbidon gave evidence.  He earned �21,000  annually.  Their
         household contained seven people: him and his  partner,  and  their
         five children. They would be willing to  make  any  cuts  in  their
         budget that were necessary, but they had little spare income.

     34. Mr Gabbidon gave evidence. He had three children. It was  noted  by
         his representative that one child was not present at the  Tribunal;
         he said he did not know where that child was.  Cross  examined,  he
         said that he could not say what family he had in America.

     35. For the Secretary of State, Ms Isherwood submitted  that  this  was
         not a case where emotional dependency exceeded the norm. The  adult
         dependency relative  Rule  represented  the  appropriate  benchmark
         against which the claim was  assessed.  Mr  Gabbidon  had  obtained
         public funds to which he was not entitled. As stated in Ribeli �39,
         citing the  earlier  decision  Britcits,  those  rules  pursued  an
         important public policy imperative. The family had blatantly defied
         the Immigration Rules and had accessed very  significant  NHS  care
         for a lengthy period. The family members here could  reasonably  be
         expected to return to Jamaica abroad if they wanted to continue  to
         care for him. The local authority's report  showed  he  could  walk
         down the stairs, and showed the level of cost  he  imposed  on  the
         public purse via his care plan, �151 weekly, more recently  �181.80
         weekly. There were tangible improvements in his health shown by the
         evidence, which had referred to dressing and eating independently.

Findings and reasons - Continuation hearing

     36. It was readily apparent from the Appellant's oral evidence that  he
         had serious problems with his memory and general  cognition.  I  do
         not consider that that appearance could reasonably be feigned,  and
         I join with the First-tier Tribunal Judge in observing that he  was
         patently a person with serious difficulties in caring  for  himself
         and in understanding the questions he was asked. I would  not  make
         such a finding without a context of medical and other  professional
         evidence to back it up, but I find that the  GP's  original  letter
         relaying his presentation some time after the stroke, combined with
         the extensive care plan put in place by the  local  authority  (and
         maintained overall multiple  assessments)  including  thrice  daily
         visits, is consistent with his presentation before me.

     37. I consider that Mr Gabbidon's family gave  honest  evidence  as  to
         their circumstances. I was unimpressed by Ms Isherwood's submission
         that family life was not established  here.  The  findings  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal accepting the existence of family life had  not
         in fact been put in doubt at the error of law hearing. But  in  any
         event, if family life is not established where  an  elderly  parent
         lives amongst their children and grandchildren for 18 years, and is
         assessed by a local authority as requiring  their  daughter's  care
         following a stroke, it is hard to imagine  how  it  could  ever  be
         established. I accept that family life is in play here,  given  the
         dependency of Mr Gabbidon  on  those  around  him  and  the  strong
         emotional feelings they plainly have upon him.

     38. There is no reason to think that there is extended family living in
         Jamaica who would be motivated to provide the very significant care
         that he now needs, having lived abroad for the greater part of  two
         decades. In any event, he has long been embedded in a care  regime,
         in  its  fifth  year  of  operation,  in  which  his  children  and
         grandchildren play a very significant part. This includes not  just
         the receipt of physical care but the  provision  of  emotional  and
         social support of a kind that it is impossible  to  see  replicated
         outside the family unit.

     39. Nor is  there  any  reason  to  infer  that  the  family  has  some
         undisclosed source of funds that could allow them to remit hundreds
         of pounds monthly to Jamaica. They are either living on benefits or
         reliant on earnings at the most precarious level. I do not consider
         they were evasive on this issue:  indeed,  Miguel  was  anxious  to
         emphasise that they would do all they could to make  ends  meet  if
         they had to make remittances abroad. It seems to  me  that  he  was
         doing so more out of pride than realism, given the  lack  of  funds
         available.

     40. Ms Isherwood set great store on the reasoning in Ribeli. There  the
         Court of Appeal  found  that  in  a  conventional  adult  dependent
         relative appeal, the  assessment  of  the  proportionality  of  any
         interference with private and family life must  bear  in  mind  the
         possibility that the Sponsor could relocate back to  their  country
         of origin to provide emotional and practical  support  to  an  aged
         relative. That would be a realistic alternative in many cases  that
         might prevent the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  being  considered
         disproportionate.

     41. But here there are multiple  minor  children  embedded  in  the  UK
         education system, some at a critical stage  of  their  development.
         The notion that the different family members presently involved  in
         Mr Gabbidon's care could realistically uproot their broader  family
         units seems to  me  untenable.  Immigration  decision  making  must
         consider the best interests of children affected by a  decision,  a
         consideration reinforced by GEN.3.2(2)  of  Appendix  FM  requiring
         regard to whether a refusal "would result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
         consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child  or
         another family member whose Article 8 rights  it  is  evident  from
         that information would be affected by  a  decision  to  refuse  the
         application."

     42. Having regard to the statutory criteria identified by section  117B
         of the 2002 Act, I note the Appellant speaks English, though it  is
         hard to imagine him integrating much outside the family unit  given
         his mental and physical limitations.   He  has  been  a  burden  on
         public funds, though his family have done all they  can  to  reduce
         the burden on social services by providing a significant input into
         his care. He is not housed at public expense, being accommodated by
         family members. His presence in the UK has  long  been  precarious,
         but the true reason rendering return to Jamaica unrealistic is  the
         relatively recent misfortune of his stroke.

     43. Were the Appellant  to  be  returned  to  Jamaica,  on  balance  of
         probabilities I accept that the family  could  not  afford  durable
         residential care for him. In the event that some limited care could
         be afforded and arranged, it would  represent  the  replacement  of
         life in an extended family unit where  numerous  relatives  clearly
         surround  him  with  love  and  affection,  with  an  institutional
         arrangement motivated principally by money. There would be a  risk,
         given his problems with caring for himself, that he would suffer  a
         very real decline in his well-being if his  present  care  routines
         now came to an end. He needs the prompting of  his  family  who  he
         clearly trusts to take his medicine. Given the extended period over
         which he has developed very extensive dependency  on  the  care  of
         family members, I consider that it is likely that his physical  and
         moral integrity, to use the language of the Strasbourg Court, would
         be very seriously damaged by  having  to  relocate  to  Jamaica.  I
         accordingly consider that the refusal of his human rights claim  is
         disproportionate to the family life with which it interferes.

    Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law.

    I remake the appeal and in so doing allow Mr Gabbidon's appeal  against
    the refusal of his human rights claim.
