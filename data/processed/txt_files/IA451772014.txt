                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


Background

 1. On 11th May 2016 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Page gave  permission
    to the appellant to appeal against the decision of Judge of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Heynes in which  he  dismissed  the  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse leave to remain on  the  basis  of
    family and private life applying the  provisions  of  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

 2. In granting permission Judge Page noted that  the  grounds  took  issue
    with the judge's consideration of Article 8 issues.   That  is  because
    the judge found that there were no compelling  circumstances  requiring
    an assessment of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules  but  did  not
    have regard to the  best  interests  of  the  appellant's  two  British
    citizen children. This meant that  judge  also  did  not  consider  the
    public interest in removal on the basis set out in Section 117B of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).

 3. Although not referred to by Judge Page, the grounds had also  contended
    that the judge wrongly concluded that the  appellant's  partner  earned
    �400 per month when the evidence actually showed  it  to  be  �400  per
    week.

 4. Judge Page granted permission on the basis that the judge had  arguably
    made no findings at all as to the best interests of the two children.

Submissions

 5. For the respondent, Mr Bates relied upon the response of 20th May  2016
    in which it was argued that the First-tier Judge had  directed  himself
    appropriately, bearing in mind that the appellant had conceded that she
    was unable to meet the requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which
    covered the appellant's circumstances both as a parent and  a  partner.
    It was also submitted that the judge had considered the best  interests
    of the children on the basis that their mother  should  regulate  their
    status and the children  would  not  be  forced  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  Reference was made  to  paragraphs  27,  29  and  32  of  the
    decision in this respect, on the basis that it was  a  matter  for  the
    parents to decide whether the children should go with the appellant.

 6. Mr Bates conceded that the judge had failed to  consider  Section  117B
    even though consideration had been given to the best interests  of  the
    children from paragraph  27  onwards  where  the  option  of  temporary
    separation was examined.  He also agreed that medical  and  educational
    information had not been considered in relation to  the  children.   He
    contended that the judge's error in relation to the amount  claimed  to
    have been earned by the sponsor was  not  material  as  the  judge  had
    eliminated consideration of income from his decision.

 7. Mr Timson relied upon the grounds.  He emphasised that  the  judge  had
    wrongly decided (paragraphs 25 and 26) that there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances warranting a grant of  leave,  when  clearly  there  were
    because of the judge's consideration  of  the  best  interests  of  the
    children and other factors particularly having regard to  the  decision
    of the Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  and  in
    Sanade and Ors (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) India [2012] UKUT
    48 (IAC).  If the judge had considered Section 117B then the  issue  of
    whether or not it would have been  reasonable  to  expect  the  British
    citizen children to leave the country would  have  been  relevant.   He
    also emphasised that he considered the mistake as  to  earnings  to  be
    relevant. Additionally the judge had  not  engaged  with  the  evidence
    produced as to the circumstances of the children.   He  requested  that
    the decision should be set aside and the appeal remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.





Conclusions

 8. The decision of the First-tier  Judge  is  inadequate  because  of  its
    failure to give proper consideration to the best interests of  the  two
    British citizen children involved.  The conclusion in paragraph  26  of
    the decision, that consideration of Article 8 issues outside the  Rules
    is  not  justified  because  there  were  no  compelling  circumstances
    identified (paragraph 25), conflicts with the subsequent paragraphs  of
    the decision in which the judge does give limited consideration to  the
    best  interests  of  the  children.   On  the  basis  that   compelling
    circumstances relating to the children were identified the judge should
    have gone on to consider Section 117B of the 2002 Act, which would then
    have triggered consideration of sub-Section (6) on the basis  that  the
    appellant had a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with
    qualifying children and it would not  be  reasonable  to  expect  those
    children to leave the United Kingdom.   It  cannot  be  said  that  the
    judge's analysis of the best interests issue from paragraph 27  onwards
    analyses the test in Section 117B(6).  Indeed, the conclusions  reached
    by the judge in paragraph 29 suggest that the judge  thought  that  the
    best interests issue was open to the parents to decide rather  than  it
    being an objective test.

 9. I also regard the judge's error in relation to evidence of  income  for
    the sponsor to be material.  Although it is argued that the  judge  has
    effectively put the issue to one side,  the  mis-statement  as  to  the
    amount of income available is significant  in  relation  to  the  issue
    which the judge identifies, namely, that the sponsor claimed to be able
    to maintain the appellant and his children.

10. For the reasons given above,  I  have  identified  material  errors  on
    points of law in the First-tier decision such that  it  should  be  set
    aside.  As the error relates both to law and evidence it is appropriate
    that the appeal should be heard  afresh  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    This accords with the principles set out in  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the
    Practice Statements for the Tribunal issued by the Senior President  of
    Tribunals on 25th September 2012.

Anonymity

An anonymity direction was not made by the First-tier Tribunal  nor  was  it
requested before the Upper Tribunal.

DIRECTIONS

11. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contains  material  errors  on
    points of law and is set aside.  The appeal is remitted to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal for hearing afresh at the Manchester Hearing  Centre  but
    not before Judge Heynes.

12. The appeal will be reheard on a date to be specified  by  the  Resident
    Judge.

13. The time estimate is two hours.

14. A Bengali interpreter will be required for the hearing.
