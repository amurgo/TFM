                            MOHAMMED MASUM BILLAH
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant sought to appeal  the  respondent's  decision  dated  03
    November 2015 to refuse to issue  a  residence  card  as  the  extended
    family member of an EEA national. At the date when the appellant lodged
    the appeal there was a right  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against the decision under The  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the EEA regulations 2006").

2.    The appeal was listed for hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
    30 January 2017. There was  no  appearance  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant or on behalf of the  respondent.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Manyarara ("the judge") proceeded to determine the appeal in a decision
    promulgated on 09 February 2017.

3.    In a four-page decision the judge outlined the relevant case  of  Sala
    (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411, which was applicable at  the
    time. She gave reasons to explain her  conclusion  that  there  was  no
    valid appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

4.    Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor granted  permission  to  appeal  against
    the decision in light of the subsequent decision in Khan v SSHD  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1755 (affirmed by the Supreme Court  in  SM  (Algeria)  v  ECO
    [2018] UKSC 9) in which the Court of Appeal  concluded  that  Sala  was
    wrongly decided. The Upper Tribunal was minded to find an error of law,
    set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision and remit the  case  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal subject to  any  further  representations  made  by
    either party within seven working days of the order. The Upper Tribunal
    does not appear to  have  received  any  written  objections  from  the
    parties in response to this direction.

5.    Although the judge headed the decision "No Valid Appeal"  and  it  was
    sent out under cover of a standard notice referring to rule 22  of  The
    Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and   Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014 I am satisfied that the decision  is  of  the  kind
    identified by the Tribunal in Ved and  another  (appealable  decisions;
    permission applications; Basnet) [2014] UKUT 150 and Abiyat and  others
    (rights of appeal) Iran [2011] UKUT 00314, which has a right of  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal. The matter was determined by a judge  with  full
    reasons and was appealable to the Upper Tribunal.

6.    In the absence of any objection to the course of  action  proposed  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor  I  find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision involved the making of an error of law because Sala  has  been
    found to be wrongly decided.

7.    The case will be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    hearing and the hearing date  listed  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  for  28
    February 2018 will be vacated.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

The decision is set aside and the case remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal
for a fresh hearing

The hearing listed in the  Upper  Tribunal  on  28  February  2018  will  be
vacated
