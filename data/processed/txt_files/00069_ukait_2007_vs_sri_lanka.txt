Representation
For the Appellant:           Mr Nicholson of Counsel
For the Respondent:          Mr Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer

Third party support  is  not  permitted  under  paragraph  317(iii)  of  the
Immigration Rules.  Where a sponsor is wholly dependent  upon  public  funds
and sends to the relative outside the UK money he has received from a  third
party he is a  mere  conduit  for  that  money.   That  does  not  create  a
dependency on the sponsor within the Rules.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is a reconsideration case.  The appellant born, 12 March 1941,  is
    a citizen of Sri Lanka.  He applied for entry clearance to  the  United
    Kingdom as the dependent relative of  his  son.   His  application  was
    refused on 4 September 2006.  He appealed to the Tribunal and following
    a hearing before Immigration Judge  Mayall  on  1  February  2007,  his
    appeal was dismissed.

 2. The appellant applied for reconsideration of the  decision  and  Senior
    Immigration Batiste ordered reconsideration of the decision on 10 April
    2007.  He ordered reconsideration in the following terms:-

        "This application  was  made  in  time  and  the  grounds,  and  in
        particular the first ground in relation to the nature of dependency
        demonstrates that the Immigration Judge may have  made  a  material
        error of law and a real possibility that the  Tribunal  would  have
        decided the appeal differently on reconsideration."


 3. The Immigration Judge was satisfied that  the  appellant  met  all  the
    requirements of  paragraph  317  of  the  Immigration  Rules  save  for
    paragraph 317(iii) of HC395.

 4. Thus the matter came before us at Field House on 26 June 2007.

 5. The relevant Immigration Rule is paragraph 317 of  HC395,  as  amended.
    It is not necessary to set out the rule out in full.   The  rule  does,
    however, require the appellant to demonstrate inter alia that he:-

         iii) is financially wholly or mainly  dependent  on  the  relative
              present and settled in the United Kingdom; "

 6. The Notice of Refusal  issued  to  the  appellant  indicated  that  the
    respondent was not satisfied  that  the  appellant  met  the  following
    requirements:-

        "
            . I am not satisfied that you are financially wholly or  mainly
              dependant on your son in the UK
            . I am not satisfied that you can and will be maintained and or
              accommodated  adequately  without  recourse  to  (additional)
              public funds in accommodation  which  your  son  or  occupies
              exclusively
            . I am not satisfied that you have no other close relatives  in
              your own  country  to  whom  you  could  turn  for  financial
              support.
            . I am not satisfied that you are living outside the UK in  the
              most exceptional compassionate circumstances and  are  mainly
              dependant financially on relatives settled in the UK."


 7. The Immigration Judge assessed the evidence and found at paragraphs  59
    to 66 of the determination inclusive that all the requirements  of  the
    rule had been met save for the question of whether  the  appellant  was
    dependent "on the relative, present and settled in the United Kingdom".

 8. At paragraphs 68 to 72 inclusive of the determination  the  Immigration
    Judge explained why he was not satisfied that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of sub-paragraph (iii).  The Immigration Judge dealt  with
    the issue of dependency on the UK relative as follows:-


        "68.     I consider that the wording of the  Rule  is  clear.   The
              appellant has to be dependent upon  his  son.   The  Rule  is
              designed to facilitate entry, in certain  circumstances,  for
              those who are dependent on their relatives settled in the UK.
               It is not a Rule designed to facilitate entry to persons who
              happen to have a relative present and settled in the  UK  but
              who are dependent financially  on  some  other  person.   For
              example it would not avail an applicant to show that he had a
              relative present and settled  in  the  UK  and  that  he  was
              financially dependent upon some  other  person  in  his  home
              country.  Similarly it would not, in my judgment,  avail  him
              to show that he had a relative present and settled in the  UK
              but he was financially dependent upon another party who  also
              happened to be present and  settled  in  the  UK.   The  Rule
              requires that the relative present and settled in the  UK  is
              the person upon whom the applicant is dependent.


        69.      I am strengthened in this conclusion by the decision in AA
              Bangladesh [2005] UKAIT 00105.


        70.      Can it be said, in this case, that the appellant is wholly
              or mainly dependent upon his son?  I regret  that  I  do  not
              think it can be so said.  One must look at the reality of the
              situation.  The reality  is  that  the  funds  come  from  Mr
              Arunan.  The sponsor is a mere conduit in this case.


        71.      It is said that because the provision of the funds depends
              upon the friendship between Mr Arunan and the  son  then,  in
              reality, the provision is  dependent  upon  the  relationship
              between sponsor and appellant.  That may be  correct  insofar
              as it goes.  It  may  well  be  that  the  reason  Mr  Arunan
              provides  support  to  the  appellant  is  because   of   his
              friendship with his son.  (Although the tenor of the evidence
              from Mr Arunan was that he was happy to provide  the  support
              because of the  overall  family  connection).   Whatever  the
              reason for  the  provision  of  support,  however,  the  fact
              remains that the support comes from Mr Arunan  and  not  from
              the sponsor.


          72. Thus I regret that I am  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant
              meets the requirements of paragraph 317(3)."


 9. The Immigration Judge then considered the applicability of Article 8 to
    this appeal.  He dismissed the appeal pursuant both to the  Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds.

10. At the hearing before us, Mr Nicholson reminded us that the sole  issue
    was whether or not the Immigration Judge had made a material  error  of
    law in his interpretation of Rule 317(iii).  He reminded  us  that  the
    Immigration Judge had found in the appellant's favour in respect of all
    other aspects of the rule and as no Reply had  been  submitted  by  the
    respondent pursuant to Rule 30 of the Procedure Rules, he invited us to
    conclude that the interpretation of Rule 317(iii) was the only relevant
    issue to be considered.

11. Relying on the grounds as submitted to the Tribunal, he  also  reminded
    us of the appellant's witness statement at Annex A1 to A3.  It had been
    accepted that the appellant was living alone, was over the  age  of  65
    and dependent on his son in the United Kingdom.   Paragraph  6  of  the
    witness statement dealt with the serious disability  of  the  son,  the
    sponsor, and its consequences.

12. Mr Nicholson submitted that this was a case which focussed on the issue
    of dependency.  The cases of AA Bangladesh [2005] UKAIT  00105  and  AM
    Ethiopia [2007] UKAIT 00058 did not deal with the issue  of  dependency
    per se.  MK Somalia [2007] UKAIT 0028 was not on point.  It was  to  be
    remembered that this appeal did not relate to a child.

13. Mr Nicholson argued that the requirement of the  rule  in  relation  to
    dependency was met in that the appellant was dependent on the  sponsor.
    The source of the sponsor's income, albeit that it created  a  separate
    dependency of its own, was not  relevant  to  the  simple  question  of
    whether or not the appellant  was  dependent  upon  the  sponsor.   The
    source of income was irrelevant.  He further relied on the fact that no
    mischief was done to Rule 317(iii) by ignoring the completely  separate
    dependency of the sponsor on Mr Arunan.

14. In such circumstances, Mr Nicholson  urged  us  to  conclude  that  the
    Immigration Judge had made a material error of law in his  construction
    of Rule 317(iii).  He further submitted that if we accepted that to  be
    the case, all other elements of the rule  having  been  satisfied,  the
    appeal should be allowed.

15. Mr Nicholson further addressed us on the need  to  be  compatible  with
    Article 8 where a lack  of  clarity  existed  in  the  wording  of  the
    Immigration Rule.  Family life had been  clearly  established  in  this
    case; there was a blood relationship, that of  parent  and  child.   At
    paragraph 75 of his determination the  Immigration  Judge  had  clearly
    found there to be family life.   Mr  Nicholson  reminded  us  that  the
    sponsor was disabled and that he wished to enjoy family life  with  his
    elderly widowed father.  The Immigration Judge's interpretation of Rule
    317 was unsustainable and incompatible with Article 8 and 14.   It  was
    appropriate in this appeal to take into consideration  the  possibility
    of discrimination under Article 14.

16. As the sponsor, because of his medical condition, was unable  to  visit
    his father in Sri Lanka, there was an interference  with  family  life.
    There was a dependency between father  and  son  and  family  life  was
    frustrated by the sponsor's disability.

17. The Immigration Judge had applied the wrong test when  considering  the
    applicability of Article 8.  He had applied the test of  exceptionality
    which had now been overtaken by the opinion in the House  of  Lords  in
    the case of Huang v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2007]
    UKHL 11.  The correct approach was set out at paragraph 20  of  the  HL
    opinion thus:-


        "the ultimate question for the appellate immigration  authority  is
        whether the refusal of leave to enter or remain,  in  circumstances
        where the life of the family cannot reasonably be  expected  to  be
        enjoyed  elsewhere,  taking  full  account  of  all  considerations
        weighing in favour of the refusal, prejudices the  family  life  of
        the applicant in a manner  sufficiently  serious  to  amount  to  a
        breach of the fundamental right protected by article 8."

18. Mr Walker addressed us on behalf of the respondent.  In accepting  that
    the money supplied by Mr Arunan was then  sent  to  the  appellant,  Mr
    Walker acknowledged some difficulty in  arguing  that  the  Immigration
    Judge had applied correctly the provisions of Rule 317(iii).  The  rule
    did not specify the source of any money and Mr Walker accepted that the
    sponsor was a conduit for the money.

19. Mr Walker expressed concerns  about  the  short-term  funding  from  Mr
    Arunan and invited  us  to  consider  the  length  of  the  dependency.
    However, he acknowledged that the Immigration Judge had found both  the
    sponsor and Mr Arunan to be credible witnesses.  At paragraph 62 of his
    determination the Immigration  Judge  had  made  specific  findings  in
    relation to Mr Arunan's ability and willingness to support the  sponsor
    to the extent of �100 per  month.   The  Immigration  Judge  stated  "I
    accept that he has done so in the past and is willing to continue to do
    so in the future.  I accept that he does so with  the  support  of  his
    wife.  I accept that, on his earnings, he is able to  afford  the  �100
    per month which he supplies to the appellant and, could, if  necessary,
    provide slightly more."

20. Mr Nicholson,  acknowledging  the  concerns  expressed  by  Mr  Walker,
    nevertheless prayed in aid that Mr Walker had essentially conceded  the
    reconsideration.  Mr  Nicholson,  submitting  that  the  appellant  was
    entitled to succeed, urged us to substitute our decision to  allow  the
    appeal in place of the Immigration Judge's dismissal of the appeal.

Conclusion

21. In reconsidering the appellant's appeal, we must  consider  whether  or
    not paragraph 317(iii) of the Immigration Rules has been  met.   Albeit
    that there appears to  be  agreement  between  both  parties  that  the
    provisions of Rule 317(iii) had been met  in  that  the  appellant  "is
    financially wholly or mainly dependent  on  the  relative  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom", that, however,  does  not  bind  us  in
    considering the issue.  Whilst we must consider the submissions made on
    behalf of the parties, it is for us  to  determine  the  issue  on  the
    evidence before us and the relevant law.

22. The Immigration Judge found that the sponsor was dependent upon  income
    support and disability living allowance as well  as  receiving  housing
    benefit.  It follows therefrom that the  sponsor  would  not  be  in  a
    position to support his father without  Mr  Arunan's  generosity.   The
    �100 per month sent to Sri Lanka to the appellant is the money provided
    by Mr Arunan.

23. The Immigration Judge at paragraphs 65  and  66  of  the  determination
    found as follows:

        "65.     I am satisfied that, since 2005 the appellant has been  in
              receipt of approximately �100 per month  from  the  UK.   The
              source of that money has  been  Mr  Arunan.   Mr  Arunan  has
              provided the money to the sponsor who  has  sent  it  to  his
              father.  I am entirely  satisfied  that  the  money  from  Mr
              Arunan was earmarked for the father.  It was not money  given
              to the sponsor to do with as  he  wished.   It  was  for  the
              father.  As Mr Arunan said in his  witness  statement  "I  am
              helping him (the sponsor) financially providing �100 a  month
              to support his father.  I am happy to support (the appellant)
              and I am able to afford it."


          66. I am  satisfied  that  the  appellant  is  wholly  or  mainly
              dependent on that money in Sri Lanka.  Without  it  he  could
              not survive.  His pension  is  not  sufficient  to  meet  his
              accommodation costs and other living expenses.  The amount of
              money from the UK is greater than the amount of his pension."

24. The Immigration Judge's conclusions were set out at paragraph 68 to 72,
    quoted earlier in this determination.

25. The factual reality is that the appellant's dependency is on Mr Arunan;
    the sponsor is nothing more than  a  mere  conduit.   There  is  little
    difference between this situation and paying an  amount  into  a  bank.
    Such an arrangement would not create a dependency on the bank.   Wholly
    dependent upon public funds, the sponsor's financial situation does not
    allow for him to remit money  to  the  appellant,  thereby  creating  a
    dependency.

26. The rationale of AA Bangladesh [2005]  UKAIT  00105  makes  clear  that
    third party support is not permitted.  Whilst AA  Bangladesh  concerned
    paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules the reasoning is clear.  We also
    note that AA was approved in MK Somalia which found that  any  enhanced
    allowance payable to a sponsor because of a  disability,  such  as  the
    disability living allowance, was not available to  support  dependents.
    That allowance is disability specific and meets  the  particular  needs
    and expenses occasioned by that disability.


27.  The burden remained on  the  appellant  to  prove  dependency  on  the
    sponsor.  To do so he needed to demonstrate that he was living  on  the
    sponsor's money.  The question which arises is whether or not the money
    was truly the sponsor's  to  give  to  the  appellant.   There  was  no
    evidence to that  effect,  such  as  income  tax  declarations  or  his
    applications for benefit.  Further if the money was indeed that of  the
    sponsor's he should have informed the social security  authorities  and
    his  benefit  would  inevitably  have  been  cut.   We   conclude   the
    Immigration Judge was correct to treat the sponsor as no  more  than  a
    conduit.

28. Accordingly, we find that the Immigration Judge made no material  error
    of law in his application  of  Rule  317(iii)  to  the  facts  of  this
    particular case.  We see no reason to doubt that the Immigration  Judge
    gave a purposive interpretation of the rule and reached at paragraph 68
    of his determination a  proper and correct  conclusion.

29. Whether or  not  the appellant  is  entitled  to   succeed   under  the
    Human   Rights   Act,  notwithstanding  his   failure   to   meet   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, is to be considered in the light
     of  Huang.  It is necessary to take full account of all considerations
    and decide whether or  not  the  inability  to  enjoy  family  life  is
    sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of the rights  protected  by
    Article 8.

30. At paragraph 75 of his determination, the Immigration Judge weighed the
    various factors relating to the  appellant's  situation  and  concluded
    that the respondent's decision was proportionate.  We consider that  he
    dealt adequately with the Article 8 issue  albeit  that  the  House  of
    Lords opinion in Huang  had  not  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  been
    published.  Although the concept of a legal test of exceptionality  has
    been rejected, the approach to Article 8 cases will be as before.   The
    expectation is, that only in rare cases will Article 8 be  successfully
    invoked when an appellant has failed to meet the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

31. Article 14 was not argued before the  Immigration  Judge.  It  was  not
    raised in the Grounds for Review.  No  unlawful  discrimination  having
    been established before us, we find no violation of Article 14  and  no
    reason under S.3 of the 1998 Human Rights Act to interpret Rule 317  in
    a way other than in which it was written.

32. We are satisfied that neither Article 8 nor Article 14 can  be  invoked
    successfully by the appellant in this appeal.

Decision

33. For the reasons given above, we find that the Immigration Judge made no
    material error of law and we accordingly order that his  determination,
    dismissing the appeal on both  immigration  grounds  and  human  rights
    grounds, shall stand.
