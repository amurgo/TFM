                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This appeal is against the decision promulgated on 21 April 2015 of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge  Povey  ("the  Judge")  who  allowed  Mr.
         Mansurbekov's appeal against the refusal of the Secretary of  State
         of his application of 11 April 2014 for an EEA  Residence  Card  as
         confirmation of his right to reside in the United Kingdom.

      2. The applicant at this hearing is the Secretary of  State.  For  the
         sake of consistency with the decision in the First-tier Tribunal we
         shall refer to her as the respondent and to Mr Mansurbekov  as  the
         appellant.

Background

      3. The appellant, who was born on 29 August 1988, is a male citizen of
         Uzbekistan. He was issued with an EEA Residence Card on 24  October
         2012 for 5 years as a result of his relationship with Nika  Kessler
         ("the  sponsor"),  a  Lithuanian  national  exercising  EEA  treaty
         rights. His application of 11 April 2014 was made because  his  new
         passport did  not  contain  confirmation  of  his  Residence  Card.
         Following a visit on 27 August  2014  by  immigration  officers  to
         where he was staying, and conversations with him and  the  sponsor,
         the application was refused on 28 August 2014 as it  was  concluded
         that their marriage was a marriage of convenience.

      4. The Judge was satisfied that it was a genuine marriage  and  not  a
         marriage of convenience  for  the  following  reasons  despite  the
         inconsistency in answers given to the immigration officers:

          1) he applied for the Residence Card 3 ï¿½ years before  he  needed
             to,

          2) he disclosed she was working 200  miles  away  from  where  he
             lived on his application,

          3) the  reasons  for  their  geographical  separation  were  work
             related,

          4) he did not rush to join her after the  respondent's  decision,
             and

          5) there was  credible  evidence  from  witnesses  and  documents
             including extensive photographs of the  couple  spanning  time
             and various events, occasions, and locations.

      5. First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid granted permission to appeal on  the
         basis that it was arguable that the Judge:

          1) did not adequately reason her findings of fact in relation  to
             the inconsistencies  that  arose  following  a  visit  by  the
             immigration officers between the various witnesses as  to  the
             nature of the appellant's marriage  to  and  his  relationship
             with the sponsor, and

          2) did not identify the documentary evidence  she  placed  weight
             upon or whether that evidence was pre or post decision.

Discussion

      6. The record of the immigration officer's visit  and  refusal  letter
         highlight the following inconsistencies within the evidence:

          1) the appellant's sister-in-law  said  the  sponsor  was  called
             Nikita, whereas the appellant said she was called Nika,

          2) the appellant's sister-in-law when  asked  who  lived  at  her
             house did not name the sponsor, whereas the appellant said she
             did live there despite the sponsor saying  she  had  lived  in
             Bury St Edmunds for 2 years and then said she lived  with  the
             appellant 2 days a week,

          3) the appellant's sister-in-law said the appellant was at  work,
             whereas he was in bed at her home,

          4)  the  appellant's  sister-in-law  said  the  sponsor  was   in
             Cambridge, whereas the appellant said she was in London,

          5) the appellant did not know where in  London  the  sponsor  was
             seeing her family,

          6) the immigration officers found none of the sponsor's  clothing
             (apart from a wedding dress in a bag), toiletries, or personal
             belongings at the house,

          7) the appellant said the sponsor was paid in cash,  whereas  she
             said her salary was paid into her bank,

          8) the appellant said the sponsor worked in Bournemouth,  whereas
             she said she worked in Bury St Edmunds,

          9) the appellant could not describe the sponsor's job,

         10) the sponsor said he worked at Crockers, whereas it is Corkers,

         11) there is no evidence of the sponsor using their joint account,

         12) another male was sleeping in the appellant's room,

         13) he had only met the sponsor's step-father and she had only met
             the appellant's brother despite having been married for over 2
             years,

         14) the sponsor was hesitant when giving the appellant's name,

         15) the sponsor said they were married at the John Baptiste Church
             in Stratford, whereas it was  St  Saviours  Church  in  Forest
             Gate, and

         16) the sponsor said she had all their  photographs,  whereas  the
             appellant said they were all at the Home Office.

      7. The Judge noted the explanations for the discrepancies:

          1) (paragraph 29) the appellant claimed he had just woken up, was
             confused, was nervous, had a friend staying with him, was  not
             allowed to get dressed by the  immigration  officers,  and  on
             occasions his mind went blank,

          2) (paragraph 30) the appellant's sister-in-law claimed  she  had
             not been sure about the appellant being at work as he had been
             working some early shifts at that time to cover for  holidays,
             and

          3) (paragraph 31) the sponsor accepted that she initially  misled
             the immigration officer about her method of payment,  she  had
             been contacted by the appellant, she had a loyalty to him, and
             she wanted to support his answers.

      8. The Judge found (paragraph 38) that despite the inconsistencies  in
         aspects of the evidence and the events of 27 August 2014, when  the
         findings referred to in paragraph 4 above were factored in and  the
         evidence viewed in  the  round,  the  appellant  had  answered  the
         reasonable suspicion regarding the marriage and, further,  that  he
         had discharged the burden of  proof  upon  him  to  show  that  the
         marriage was not a marriage of convenience.

      9. Mr Shajko submitted that there was no material error of law as  any
         discrepancies were minor. Focussing on these deviated from the main
         picture.  The discrepancies arose due  to  the  7am  visit  by  the
         immigration officers to the appellant's bedroom.  The  Judge  could
         take into account new evidence and look at the whole picture.  They
         could not fabricate 5 live witnesses and 200 photographs  taken  on
         different dates and in different settings.

     10. Ms Isherwood submitted that it was not just the appellant  who  was
         inconsistent. All the witnesses were. Whilst it was conceded by the
         appellant that errors were made in the evidence,  no  reasons  were
         given for the inconsistencies. The sponsor accepted she had  misled
         the immigration officers over her  method  of  payment.  The  Judge
         simply failed to deal with the concerns expressed by the respondent
         and resolve the issues. This amounts to a material error of law.

Our findings

     11. The inconsistencies relied upon by the respondent,  which  we  have
         set out at [6] above, include some which are important  and  go  to
         the core of the issue  as  to  whether  the  marriage  between  the
         appellant  and  the  sponsor  is  a  marriage  of  convenience.  In
         particular, we refer to the following:

         (i)      that  the  appellant  said  that  the  sponsor  worked  in
             Bournemouth whereas she said she worked in Bury St Edmunds;

         (ii)     that the appellant could not describe  the  sponsor's  job
             other than to say that it was agency work in  Bournemouth  and
             he did not know the name of the agency;

         (iii)    that the appellant  did  not  know  where  in  London  the
             sponsor was seeing her family;

         (iv)     that the appellant had only met the  sponsor's  stepfather
             and the sponsor had only met his brother; this notwithstanding
             the fact that the appellant lived with his brother, sister-in-
             law and their children, the appellant and the  sponsor  having
             been married for over two years and the  sponsor  saying  that
             she stayed with the appellant at the address  visited  by  the
             immigration officers two days a week;

         (v)      that, whilst the sponsor said she stayed  at  the  address
             visited by the immigration officers two days a week from which
             it followed that she stayed elsewhere  the  remainder  of  the
             time, the appellant did not mention that  she  lived  anywhere
             else, only saying that she had gone to visit family in  London
             three days before the visit by the immigration officers; and

         (vi)     there was no evidence of the sponsor's personal belongings
             at  the  address   visited   by   the   immigration   officers
             notwithstanding that the sponsor said she lived there two days
             a week.

     12. We do not, for a moment, suggest that  the  Judge  was  obliged  to
         consider each and every inconsistency. However, when  viewed  as  a
         whole, the matters set out at [11] above are not peripheral. On any
         legitimate view, they go to core of the issue  as  to  whether  the
         marriage was a marriage of convenience.

     13. On a proper analysis of the Judge's  reasoning,  we  are  satisfied
         that he did  not  engage  with  these  concerns.  At  [34]  of  the
         determination, he referred to the fact that the sponsor  works  and
         lives in Bury St. Edmunds which he considered was  consistent  with
         the application form that had been completed by the  appellant.  He
         posed the question: "If the marriage is a sham, why openly recorded
         [sic] such information in the application form?" The  reasoning  in
         [34] simply does not address the concern of  the  respondent,  that
         the appellant said that the sponsor worked in  Bournemouth  whereas
         she said she worked in Bury St.  Edmunds.  Indeed,  the   reasoning
         that the Judge relied upon at [34] itself raised a  further  issue:
         If the appellant completed the application  form  saying  that  the
         sponsor worked in Bury St. Edmunds, why did he then say she  worked
         in Bournemouth when asked by the immigration  officers  during  the
         visit?

     14. There was nothing in  [35]  or  [36]  of  the  determination  which
         addresses  why  the  appellant  said  that  the  sponsor  works  in
         Bournemouth whereas she said she works in Bury St. Edmunds.

     15. There was nothing in the Judge's reasoning  which  addressed  (ii)-
         (vi) of the matters listed at [11] above.

     16. Mr Shajko repeatedly asked us to  remember  that  the  Judge  heard
         evidence from five witnesses and had many photographs.  He told  us
         that the Judge had 200 photographs of the couple taken on different
         dates  and  in  different  settings.  He  asked  us  to  take   the
         photographs into account. He questioned whether the appellant could
         have fabricated the evidence of five live witnesses.

     17. However, when one looks at the determination, the Judge  said  very
         little about the evidence of the witnesses and the photographs. The
         only paragraph which dealt with  this  evidence  is  para  37.   He
         referred to the witnesses stating that the  marriage  was  genuine.
         However, if he had engaged with the issues at [11] above  he  might
         have taken a different view of their evidence. He referred  to  the
         photographs  "spanning  time  and  various  events,  occasions  and
         locations". He did not explain how the evidence  of  the  witnesses
         and/or the photographs overcame the issues set out at [11] above.

     18. We repeat that we do not say that the Judge  was  obliged  to  deal
         with each and every inconsistency. However, as we  have  said,  the
         issues set out at [11] above were not at the periphery but went  to
         the core of the issue  as  to  whether  the  marriage  between  the
         appellant and the sponsor is a marriage of convenience. It was  not
         just one issue that the Judge  failed  to  deal  with.  There  were
         several which, collectively, go to the  core  of  the  case  as  to
         whether the marriage was a marriage of convenience.

     19. Those issues need to be compared with the issues that the Judge did
         deal with, insofar as he dealt with credibility issues.   We  refer
         to [29]-[37] of the determination.  We have already dealt with some
         of these paragraphs.

     20. It is plain, in our view, that the issues that the Judge failed  to
         deal with ([11] above) were of greater  importance  than  those  he
         dealt with, on any legitimate view.

     21. For all of these reasons, we are satisfied that, in failing to deal
         with the issues at [11] above and even allowing for the  fact  that
         he heard live witnesses, the Judge was not reasonably entitled,  on
         any legitimate view, to reach his finding that  the  appellant  had
         discharged the burden of proof upon him to show that  his  marriage
         was a genuine marriage.

     22. We are therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination  involved
         an error on a point of law such that it be set  aside.  We  set  it
         aside in its entirety.

Re-making the decision

     23. The effect of  Practice  Statement  7  of  the  Senior  President's
         Practice Statement of 25 September 2012 is such that, in most cases
         where a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (FtT) is set aside, the
         Upper Tribunal will go on  to  re-make  the  decision,  instead  of
         remitting the case to the FtT. The position is, however,  otherwise
         in the circumstances described in  Practice  Statement  7.2(a)  and
         (b). These circumstances are where (a) the effect of the  error  of
         law has been that a party has been deprived of a  fair  hearing  or
         other opportunity for that party's case to be put to and considered
         by the FTT; or (b), there are highly  compelling  reasons  why  the
         decision should not be re-made by the UT (these will be rare).

     24. Having regard to para 7 of the Practice Statement and the Court  of
         Appeal's judgment in JD (Congo) & Others [2012] EWCA  Civ  327,  we
         are of the view  that  in  this  case  Practice  Statement  7(2)(a)
         applies.  This  is  because  the  outcome  of  the  case  turns  on
         credibility  and  because  the   appellant   was   found   credible
         previously.

     25. We direct that the decision on the appeal be re-made by a Judge  of
         the FtT other than Judge Povey. None of the findings of Judge Povey
         shall stand.



Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of a material error on a point of law.

    We set aside the decision.

    We remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by any Judge
    except Judge Povey.

    The time estimate is 4 hours given the number of  potential  witnesses.
    We are told that no interpreter is required.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    will issue  consequent  directions  regarding  the  filing  of  further
    evidence and the date time and venue of the hearing.
