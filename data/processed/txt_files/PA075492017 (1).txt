Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Mr Jagadesham, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
first Appellant in this determination identified as SK.


   1. I have made an anonymity order because this  decision  refers  to  the
      circumstances of SK's minor children.


Introduction

   2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
      ('SSHD') against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal ('FTT') dated 3
      October 2017, in which it allowed the appeal of SK, a citizen of Iran,
      on Article 8 grounds only, against the SSHD's decisions dated 19  July
      2017 and 8 August 2017 to refuse his human rights claims.


Background

   3. SK has been in the  UK  continuously  since  December  2003,  when  he
      claimed asylum.  This claim was refused and he became  appeals  rights
      exhausted in November 2004.  He remained in the UK without leave until
      he was granted a residence card on  19  November  2009  following  his
      marriage to an EEA citizen.


   4. On 4 February 2013 he was sentenced to 12 months  imprisonment  having
      been convicted of two offences: using a false UK residence permit  and
      benefit fraud in the sum of ï¿½17,383.  He  has  not  re-offended  since
      that time.


   5. SK's application for permanent  residence  was  refused  in  two  2014
      decisions and on 14  October  2015  a  deportation  order  was  signed
      against him.  Thereafter, SK made further submissions in support of  a
      fresh asylum claim and his family life in the UK.  These were  refused
      on 19 July 2017.  In that decision the SSHD noted at  [24]  that  SK's
      claimed spouse at  the  time  of  making  the  fresh  submissions,  Ms
      Popikova, was interviewed by immigration officers and  initially  said
      that she did not know SK before saying that she did marry SK  but  she
      did this to help a friend and she was never in a relationship with SK.


   6. SK made further submissions.  These were refused  in  a  supplementary
      letter dated 8 August 2017.


FTT decision under appeal

   7. The FTT accepted that SK has a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
      with his spouse, MK, and played an active parental role for both their
      biological  child  together,  A,  and  MK's  child  from  a   previous
      relationship, B.  The FTT concluded that deportation would effectively
      end these relationships and would be unduly harsh.


   8. The FTT also found that the  asylum  and  humanitarian  claim  failed.
      There has been no cross-appeal regarding the protection claim,  and  I
      need say no more about it.


Grounds of appeal

   9. The grounds of appeal are not numbered or clearly set out  but  appear
      to be these:
   1) The  finding  that  SK  is  in  a  genuine  relationship  with  MK  is
      inadequately reasoned.


   2) The FTT failed to give any  weight  to  the  public  interest  or  the
      principle that it will be rare for the best interests of  children  to
      outweigh the strong public interest in deporting foreign criminals (AJ
      (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 1012), and the balancing exercise is
      one dimensional.


   3) The FTT failed to provide any reasons why it would be unduly harsh for
      MK to return to Iraq with SK and the children, and to live there as  a
      family unit.


   4) The FTT failed to provide reasons why it would be unduly harsh for the
      SK's family members to remain in the UK.

  10. The SSHD was granted permission to  appeal,  on  the  basis  of  these
      grounds, by FTT Judge Bird in a decision dated 13 October 2017.


Hearing

  11. Mr McVeety relied upon the grounds of appeal, and invited me to  allow
      the SSHD's appeal by setting aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal and remitting the appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Mr
      Jagadeshan relied upon a helpful skeleton argument / rule 24 response.



  12. After hearing from both representatives I gave my  decision  that  the
      FTT had erred in law, for reasons which I now provide.


Legal framework

  13. Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, in so far
      as it is relevant to this case states as follows;

                 "PART  5A  ARTICLE  8  OF   THE   ECHR:   PUBLIC   INTEREST
                 CONSIDERATIONS


                 117A Application of this Part
                 (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required
                 to determine whether a decision made under the  Immigration
                 Acts-(a) breaches a person's right to respect  for  private
                 and family life under Article 8, and(b) as a  result  would
                 be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
                 (2) In considering the public interest question, the  court
                 or tribunal must (in particular)  have  regard-(a)  in  all
                 cases, to the considerations listed in  section  117B,  and
                 (b)  in  cases  concerning  the  deportation   of   foreign
                 criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C.
                 (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means
                 the question of whether an  interference  with  a  person's
                 right to respect for private and family life  is  justified
                 under Article 8(2).


                 117B Article 8: public interest  considerations  applicable
                 in all cases
                 (1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is  in
                 the public interest.
                 (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the
                 interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
                 that persons who seek to enter  or  remain  in  the  United
                 Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons who  can
                 speak English-(a) are less of a burden  on  taxpayers,  and
                 (b) are better able to integrate into society.
                 (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the
                 interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
                 that persons who seek to enter  or  remain  in  the  United
                 Kingdom are financially independent, because such  persons-
                 (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and (b) are better  able
                 to integrate into society.
                 (4) Little weight should be given to-(a) a private life, or
                 (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,that is
                 established by a person at a time when the person is in the
                 United Kingdom unlawfully.
                 (5) Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private  life
                 established by  a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
                 immigration status is precarious.
                 (6)...


                 117C  Article  8:  additional   considerations   in   cases
                 involving foreign criminals
                 (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in  the  public
                 interest.
                 (2) The more serious the offence  committed  by  a  foreign
                 criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation
                 of the criminal.
                 (3) In the case of a foreign criminal  ("C")  who  has  not
                 been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or
                 more, the public interest requires C's  deportation  unless
                 Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.
                 (4) Exception 1...
                 (5)  Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine   and
                 subsisting relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a
                 genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship   with   a
                 qualifying child, and the effect of C's deportation on  the
                 partner or child would be unduly harsh."



Error of law discussion

   1) Findings of fact / reasons

  14. The SSHD clearly disputed the genuineness of the relationship  between
      SK and MK.  The summary of the submissions before the FT at [14] makes
      it clear that the SSHD advanced  prima  facie  compelling  reasons  to
      doubt the relationship: (i) SK has previously entered a sham marriage;
      (ii) MK has distanced herself from her witness statement and there was
      inconsistent evidence regarding the marriage.


  15. The FTT's findings of  fact  commence  at  [17].   Reference  is  made
      therein to SK having entered into a marriage  with  Ms  Papikova,  and
      having obtained an EEA residence card following this.  At [23] the FTT
      notes that SK divorced Ms Popikova in July 2016 and only  relies  upon
      his family life with MK such that the relationship  with  Ms  Popikova
      "is not, therefore relevant to  family  life  considerations  in  this
      appeal as it has ended".  The FTT says no more about the  relationship
      after this.


  16. In my judgment it was an error of law to fail  to  resolve  the  clear
      submission  that  the  appellant  had  entered  into  a  marriage   of
      convenience.  If proven, such a finding is relevant  to  SK's  general
      credibility; SK's approach  to  relationships  in  the  past  and  the
      deception  he  is  prepared  to  employ;  a  clearer  picture  of  his
      immigration history; the wider  countervailing  considerations  to  be
      taken into account together with criminal and immigration history when
      undertaking the requisite balancing exercise.


  17. It follows that in failing to make  a  finding  on  an  issue  clearly
      relevant to the SSHD's case and  in  any  event  the  public  interest
      considerations, the FTT has  erred  in  law,  and  failed  to  provide
      adequate reasons for rejecting the SSHD's case on the  genuineness  of
      SK's current relationship.


  18. I entirely accept as Mr Jagadeshan submitted that  the  FTT's  finding
      that SK played an active parental role for A and B  is  a  significant
      factor and an essential part of the reasoning provided.  The FTT  also
      accepted there was documentary evidence  confirming  that  the  couple
      resided together. These matters lend powerful  support  to  the  claim
      that the relationship is genuine.  However, the FTT was still  obliged
      to address the alleged marriage of  convenience  and  the  failure  to
      provide any reasoning whatsoever regarding  this  serious  allegation,
      adversely  infects  the  overall  finding  that  the  relationship  is
      genuine.

   2) Approach to the unduly harsh test

  19. In MM (Uganda) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 617 the  Court  of  Appeal  held
      that the more pressing the public interest in removal, the  harder  it
      was to show its effects would be unduly harsh. It  is  clear  from  MM
      that it is not appropriate to  consider  the  unduly  harsh  questions
      solely from the perspective of the impact which deportation  would  be
      likely to have upon the children  or  partner  involved  and  all  the
      relevant  countervailing  considerations,   including   criminal   and
      immigration history must be considered.


  20. The FTT reached the following conclusion at [28]:


                 "Having taken account of all the circumstances in this
                 case, including his criminal history and his immigration
                 history, I very marginally incline to finding that the
                 deportation of the appellant would be unduly harsh."


  21. Even when the decision is read as a whole, the FTT's approach  to  the
      unduly harsh question posed at  section  117C(5)  is  flawed.   First,
      whilst the FTT took into account SK's criminal and immigration history
      and properly directed itself that very  considerable  weight  must  be
      attributed to the public interest at [27], the FTT failed to take into
      account  and  make  a  finding  upon  an  important  aspect  of   SK's
      immigration history: the allegation that he entered  into  and  relied
      upon a marriage of convenience.


  22. Second, the conclusion that SK's deportation  would  be  unduly  harsh
      fails to engage with the wording in section 117C(5).    It  is  simply
      not known whether the FTT regarded the effect of SK's deportation,  to
      be unduly harsh on his partner or child or step-child, or all three.


  23. Third, the FTT  has  entirely  failed  to  address  the  section  117B
      considerations, and  in  particular  section  117B(4)  -  see  section
      117A(2): in considering the public interest  question,  the  court  or
      tribunal must (in  particular)  have  regard  in  all  cases,  to  the
      considerations listed in section 117B.  It is undisputed that  SK  was
      in the UK unlawfully when he established his relationship with MK, and
      as such little weight must be given to that relationship.


  24. Fourth, the FTT noted MK's intention to remain  in  the  UK  with  her
      children if SK is deported at  [25]  but  wholly  failed  to  consider
      whether  that  was  a  reasonable  approach  to   adopt   or   whether
      notwithstanding  that  approach,  there  would  be   an   absence   of
      insurmountable obstacles in establishing family life in Iraq.  MK is a
      British citizen, as are her children.  However, MK is SK's cousin, and
      comes from the same part of  Iraq  as  him  -  Sulaymaniya.   This  is
      acknowledged to be a relatively  safe  part  of  Iraq  for  those  who
      previously resided there.  As recorded at [24], MK had visited Iraq in
      the relatively recent past.  I note that there was a dispute regarding
      B's relationship with his biological father in the UK,  and  this  may
      have been an obstacle to family life in Iraq, however the FTT made  no
      clear findings on this, simply  noting  at  [25]  that  there  was  no
      evidence B's father was living in the UK  and  visiting  B  every  six
      weeks as claimed.


  25. Finally, it is difficult to understand which particular  circumstances
      were considered sufficient to "marginally incline" to finding in  SK's
      favour.  After all the FTT did not  consider  the  deleterious  effect
      upon A coupled with the low risk of offending to  be  sufficient  (see
      [28]) and this is  a  case  in  which  very  considerable  weight  was
      accorded to SK's criminal history, and on  any  view  his  immigration
      history was poor.



Disposal

  26. I have had regard to para  7.2  of  the  relevant  Senior  President's
      Practice Statement and the nature and extent of the  factual  findings
      required in remaking the decision, and I have decided that this is  an
      appropriate case to remit to the FTT.


Decision

  27. The FTT decision involved the making of a material error of law.   Its
      decision cannot stand and is set aside.

      28. The appeal shall be remade by the FTT de novo.


Directions



   1) When listing the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal  it  would  be
      helpful to take Mr Jagadesham's  availability  into  account.  Kurdish
      Sorani interpreter necessary.


   2) SK's solicitors shall file and serve all evidence relied upon  in  one
      comprehensive, indexed and paginated bundle 28  days  before  the  FTT
      hearing, and a skeleton argument 21 days before  the  hearing.   These
      documents shall be addressed for Mr McVeety's attention.


   3) The SSHD shall file and  serve  a  position  statement  outlining  her
      updated position seven days before the FTT hearing.
