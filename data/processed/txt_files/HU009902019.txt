This decision follows a remote hearing in respect of which  there  has  been
no objection by the parties. The form of remote hearing was by  video  (V),
the platform was Skype for Business. A face to face hearing  was  not  held
because it was not practicable and all  issues  could  be  determined  in  a
remote hearing.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO") has been granted permission  to
         appeal against the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Caskie ("the judge"), promulgated on 19 September 2019, in which he
         allowed the human rights appeal (in the form of an entry  clearance
         application) of Mrs Amjad  against  the  ECO's  decision  dated  11
         December 2018 refusing  her  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse  under
         Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.

      2. Mrs Amjad is a national of Pakistan who  was  born  on  6  February
         1982. She is married to Mr Mohammed Amjad ("the sponsor") who is  a
         British citizen. Mrs Amjad made an application for entry  clearance
         to  join  her  sponsor  on  5  September  2018  under  the  partner
         provisions of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules. She  relied  on
         her sponsor's employment as  a  chef  with  a  company  called  EZE
         Bradford Ltd.

      3. The ECO refused the application on the basis that Mrs Amjad did not
         meet  the  eligibility  financial  requirements  of  E-ECP.3.1.  of
         Appendix FM. This provides, in material part:

            E-ECP.3.1. The applicant must provide specified evidence,  from
            the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2., of-


            a) a specified gross annual income of at least- (i) �18,600;
            b) ...

      4. E-ECP.3.2. provides, in material part:


            E-ECP.3.2. When determining whether the  financial  requirement
            in paragraph E-ECP. 3.1. is met only the following sources will
            be taken into account-


            a) income of the partner  from  specified  employment  or  self-
               employment, which, in respect of a partner returning  to  the
               UK with the applicant, can include  specified  employment  or
               self-employment overseas and in the UK;
            b) ...

      5. The 'specific evidence'  that  must  be  provided  is  set  out  in
         Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules. Mrs Amjad  relied  on  her
         sponsor's salaried employment. The specified  evidence  he  had  to
         provide consisted of payslips covering a 6 months period  prior  to
         the date of the application (Appendix FM-SE 2(a)),  a  letter  from
         the employer (confirming the sponsor's employment and gross salary,
         the length of his employment, the period over which he was paid the
         level of salary relied on in  the  application,  and  the  type  of
         employment) (Appendix FM-SE  2(b)),  and  personal  bank  statement
         corresponding to the same period as the payslips showing  that  the
         salary has been  paid  into  the  account  in  the  sponsor's  name
         (Appendix FM-SE 2(c)). Under Appendix FM-SE 2A(i) an applicant may,
         in addition to the payslips and personal bank statements, submit  a
         P60 for the relevant period(s) of employment relied upon.


      6. The sponsor and an account  manager  from  EZE  Bradford  Ltd  were
         interviewed by telephone on 26 November 2018.


      7. The application was refused for two reasons. Firstly, the  payslips
         provided by the sponsor did not correspond with the total  payments
         received into his bank account. There were additional deposits that
         appeared to come from his employer that were not accounted for.  By
         way of example, in addition to the  deposit  corresponding  to  the
         sponsor' February 2018 payslip (deposited on 1 March 2018), a total
         of �1,500 was deposited into the bank account in three payments  of
         �500 on 7th, 15th and 26  March  (I  note  that  all  the  employer
         related deposits into  the  sponsor's  bank  account  covering  the
         period March to 1 May 2018, and the salary deposit on 8 June  2018,
         emanated from "EZE Manc LTD SW", which appears to  correspond  with
         the EZE branch located in Manchester; all the  remaining  deposits,
         both corresponding to  payslips  and  other  amounts,  appeared  to
         emanate from the Bradford EZE branch). The letter  from  the  Human
         Resources Manager of EZE Bradford Ltd,  dated  10  September  2018,
         indicated  that  the  sponsor  was  initially  employed  at   their
         Manchester branch and was then transferred to the Bradford  branch.
         I further note, by  way  of  observation  only,  that  neither  the
         sponsor nor the  representative  from  EZE  Bradford  Ltd  who  was
         interviewed on 26 November 2018 were asked any questions concerning
         the additional deposits into the sponsor's bank account.


      8. The second reason advanced by the ECO  was  that  the  August  2018
         payslip was incorrectly paid.  The  payslip  noted  a  net  pay  of
         �1,332.65 but the amount paid into the sponsor's bank  account  was
         �1,332.64. There was therefore a difference of 1p.

      9. Based on the discrepancy of 1p and the absence of adequate evidence
         of the origin of the additional  funds  being  deposited  into  the
         sponsor's bank account, the ECO was not satisfied  that  Mrs  Amjad
         had provided the specified evidence  to  accurately  represent  her
         sponsor's employment.


     10. Mrs Amjad appealed the  respondent's  decision  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal pursuant to  s.82  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

     11. The judge heard oral evidence from the sponsor  which  supplemented
         his written statement dated 16 July 2019 which was contained in the
         bundle of documents provided by Mrs Amjad in support of her appeal.
         The bundle additionally contained the  documents  accompanying  her
         application including,  inter  alia,  the  sponsor's  bank  account
         statements covering the months  March  2018  to  August  2018,  his
         salary slips, and the letter from his employer dated  10  September
         2018. In addition, Mrs Amjad's bundle also contained a  P60  issued
         to the sponsor in respect of his employment with EZE Manchester Ltd
         for the tax year ending 5 April 2018. According  to  this  P60  the
         sponsor's employment was �3,166.68.


     12. At the appeal hearing a new issue arose  concerning  the  P60.  The
         letter from EZE  Bradford  Ltd  accompanying  the  entry  clearance
         application, and the solicitor's covering  letter,  confirmed  that
         the sponsor had been employed since 1 November 2017 and that he had
         initially been employed  at  the  Manchester  branch  before  being
         transferred to Bradford. At  the  hearing  the  sponsor  confirmed,
         during cross-examination, that his earning from his employer to  31
         March 2018 came to a total of �6,650. His P60 however  disclosed  a
         total  figure  for  'pay'  of  �3,166.68.  The  Presenting  Officer
         submitted, in addition to the concerns already  identified  in  the
         Reasons for Refusal Letter, that the difference between the  income
         detailed in the P60 and  that  reflected  in  the  sponsor's  other
         evidence undermined his claimed income such that  the  judge  could
         not be satisfied the sponsor actually earned the amount he  claimed
         to earn.

     13. At [15] of  his  decision  the  judge  found  it  "clear  that  the
         information provided in  the  sponsor's  P60  does  not  accurately
         reflect the level of salary it is said he is paid  as  demonstrated
         in his payslips." The judge then stated:

             "There is clearly an analogy between the  alleged  discrepancy
             in the recent case law, in the Court of Appeal regarding those
             who have sought Leave to Remain in the  UK  on  the  basis  of
             specific  earnings  but  have  declared  significantly   lower
             earnings in respect of the extent of the tax liability payable
             to HMRC. I am of course conscious  that  as  an  employee  the
             [respondent's] role in the preparation of and accuracy with  a
             P60  is  limited  as  that  responsibility  rests  (at   least
             initially) with the employer and not the employee. I  consider
             that the employer in this case may not be fully declaring  the
             [sponsor's] earnings to HMRC or in the  alternative  may  have
             inaccurately  declared  the  [sponsor's]   earnings   of   the
             payslips."

     14. At [16] the judge indicated that he had the benefit of  seeing  and
         hearing the sponsor give evidence and was satisfied that he  was  a
         truthful witness. The judge  noted  that  the  Presenting  Officer,
         despite making significant criticism of the  documentary  evidence,
         did not  specifically  attack  the  sponsor's  credibility  or  the
         reliability of the sponsor's evidence, and noted that  the  sponsor
         gave his evidence in a clear and direct manner.


     15. At [17] the judge noted the discrepancy in the August 2018  payslip
         and deposit and did not consider that this discrepancy was material
         in respect of Appendix FM, although the judge stated that it may be
         relevant as to whether Appendix FM-SE was met.

     16.  At  [18]  the  judge  noted  the  sponsor's  explanation  for  the
         additional deposits into his bank account (the sponsor  claimed  he
         was purchasing  daily  produce  on  behalf  of  his  employer  from
         wholesalers, including Booker Wholesale,  and  the  employer  later
         transferred the monies owed into the sponsor's bank  account).  The
         judge observed that the Presenting Officer's  suggestion  that  the
         mechanism used to pay the wholesalers could have been done  through
         a business account "... was belied by the  nature  of  a  cash-and-
         carry business." The judge stated:

             "that some payments were made into the sponsor's bank  account
             in that respect and on other occasions payments were  said  to
             be made in cash to the "sponsor" does not appear to me  to  be
             particularly relevant to the real question, which of course is
             whether [Mrs Amjad] may be maintained by the sponsor's  income
             which must exceed the minimum income requirement."

     17. At [18] the judge stated:


             "I do accept that the precise requirements of appendix  FM  SE
             and [sic] not apparently complied  with  because  of  the  one
             penny  discrepancy  in  the  August  2018  payslip  and   bank
             statement. Had the sponsor not been such a  clear  and  direct
             witness that I might have taken a different view, in the sense
             that  cumulatively  the  three  potential   discrepancies   as
             described  above  might  undermine  the  reliability  of   the
             evidence that I was being given. In fact, I did  not  consider
             that on consideration two of those matters where material  and
             in a world where tax and national insurance contributions  are
             calculated on the basis of percentages I consider that the  1p
             discrepancy was much more likely  to  be  as  a  result  of  a
             rounding error rather than anything else."


     18. Having found that the immigration rules were met, and applying  the
         guidance in TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) v  SSHD  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
         1109, the judge allowed the human rights appeal.

The challenge to the judge's decision

     19. The grounds of appeal, amplified  by  further  written  submissions
         dated 12 May 2020 and the oral submissions  of  Ms  Cunha,  contend
         that there was no appropriate  analogy  between  Balajigari  [2019]
         EWCA Civ 673, the Court of Appeal authority that the judge referred
         to without mentioning by name, and that the  approach  consequently
         adopted by the judge was wrong in law. The grounds further  contend
         that the judge's finding that the  sponsor's  employer  had  under-
         declared his income to HMRC was  overly  speculative  and  was  not
         supported by any evidential basis. The  judge's  finding  that  the
         sponsor carried no responsibility for the discrepancy  in  relation
         to the P60 was also speculative as it was open to  the  sponsor  to
         seek evidence from the employer  at  the  hearing  to  explain  the
         position and because the sponsor himself had received the  P60  and
         he therefore would have been  aware  that  it  did  not  accurately
         reflect his earnings. He was in  turn  responsible  for  rectifying
         this and taking the matter up with his employer or  HMRC  as  needs
         be.  The  respondent  additionally  contended  that   the   judge's
         credibility assessment was based on the sponsor's appearance  which
         was "as credible as phrenology", and the submission  that  none  of
         the payments the sponsor claimed had been advanced by his  employer
         to cover purchases  tallied  with  the  documentary  evidence.  The
         evidence it was submitted did not demonstrate the sponsor's  income
         over a sustained period of time and did not meet  the  requirements
         of  appendix  FM-SE.  The  finding  at  [19]   that   the   precise
         requirements of Appendix FM-Essie had not been  complied  with  was
         dispositive of the appeal under the immigration rules.

The directions of Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer

     20. permission to appeal was granted by Designated First-tier  Tribunal
         Manuell. A hearing listed before Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer on 12
         March 2020 was adjourned because the Presenting Officer was ill. At
         this hearing Judge Plimmer indicated to Mr Haq, who has represented
         Mrs  Amjad  at  all  the  hearings,  her  concern  with   the   P60
         discrepancy. Mr Haq sought to defend the judge's  decision  arguing
         that there had been full compliance with Appendix FM-SE and the P60
         was merely an additional document. He  submitted  that  the  figure
         contained in it might be explained by a degree of confusion  caused
         by the sponsor moving from his employer's Manchester restaurant  to
         the Bradford restaurant. Judge Plimmer made clear to Mr  Haq  that,
         in order for the case  to  fairly  proceed  it  would  need  to  be
         adjourned because the Upper Tribunal would need to  hear  from  the
         ECO in relation to the points that Mr Haq sought  to  raise.  Judge
         Plimmer suggested that it might be helpful for Mrs  Amjad  to  file
         and serve evidence that might explain the figure contained  in  the
         P60. Although this would be fresh evidence and any  application  to
         rely on it would have to be formally made, judge Plimmer considered
         it might be helpful for the ECO to have  this  information  in  any
         event,  should  there  be  a  willingness   to   consider   matters
         pragmatically.  Judge  Plimmer  issued  directions  requiring   Mrs
         Amjad's representative  to  file  and  serve,  within  21  days,  a
         respondent's notice and a bundle containing  any  further  evidence
         relied upon, together with the  necessary  application  seeking  to
         rely on that evidence. The directions were issued on 13 March 2020.


     21. Further directions, reflecting the Covid-19 pandemic,  were  issued
         on  6  April  2020.  On  11  May  2020  an  email  from  Mrs  Amjad
         representatives was received containing a 50 page bundle, pages  48
         to 50 of which contained evidence it was not  available  to  First-
         tier Tribunal. The ECO's 'response' was received on 12 May 2020. On
         16 September 2020 Judge Plimmer  considered  that  the  appeal  was
         appropriate to be heard remotely. As  Mrs  Amjad's  representatives
         had failed to comply with the  previous  directions  Judge  Plimmer
         issued further directions requiring the representatives to file and
         serve within 14 days  further  written  submissions  containing  or
         accompanying a rule 24(3) response, a notice that complies with the
         rule 15 (2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008,
         and a clear response to the ECO's grounds of appeal. So far as I am
         aware these directions were not complied with.

     22. At the error of law hearing Mr Haq acknowledged  that  the  further
         evidence that had been  provided  by  Mrs  Amjad's  representatives
         (which consisted of a letter from the Human Resources Manager dated
         29 April 2020, and P60s for the tax years ending 5 April  2019  and
         2020), even if a formal application to  adduce  that  evidence  had
         been made, did not account for the discrepancy in the 2018 P60.  He
         indicated that he  was  in  difficulty  in  defending  the  judge's
         decision respect of discrepancy arising between the figure  in  the
         sponsor's 2018 P60 and the other evidence of the sponsor's income.

     23. I indicated at the  hearing  that  I  was  satisfied  the  decision
         contained errors on points of law that required it to be set aside.

Discussion

     24. Given Mr Haq's acceptance that the  decision  contains  a  material
         error of law in respect  of  the  judge's  assessment  of  the  P60
         discrepancy, I can deal with this point relatively briefly.


     25. Although the sponsor had provided the type documents  specified  in
         Appendix FM-SE for demonstrating his income, and  although  he  was
         not required to provide a P60 (and in fact none was  provided  with
         Mrs Amjad's application), the judge  accepted  there  was  a  clear
         discrepancy between the income disclosed in the wage slips and  the
         sponsor's bank account on the one hand, and that disclosed  in  the
         2018 P60 on the other. This discrepancy was sufficient to establish
         legitimate concern relating to  the  sponsor's  income.  The  judge
         appears  to  have  approached  this  discrepancy  by  reference  to
         Balajigari which, although not  named,  was  the  Court  of  Appeal
         authority dealing with differences in income figures  disclosed  to
         HMRC and the Home Office in the context of refusals under paragraph
         322(5) of the general grounds  of  refusal  under  the  Immigration
         Rules. It is wholly unclear how this authority was analogous to the
         instant appeal. The judge fails to explain  how  the  issues  under
         consideration in  Balajigari  and  the  principles  that  authority
         established are relevant or  analogous  with  the  instant  appeal.
         Moreover, the judge's conclusion that the discrepancy  in  the  P60
         was the result of not fully declaring the sponsor's income to  HMRC
         or not accurately declaring the sponsor's income on his payslips is
         without any evidential foundation. The  judge  has  engaged  in  an
         unwarranted degree of speculation.  Further,  if  either  of  these
         alternatives did in fact occur, the sponsor would have  been  aware
         either that his P60 for the year ending April 2018 did not  reflect
         his actual income, or that his payslips did not reflect his  actual
         earnings, matter that may then have reflected on his credibility.


     26. I have additional concerns  with  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
         explanation provided  by  the  sponsor  concerning  the  additional
         deposits in his bank account from his employer and the evidence  he
         adduced in support of that explanation. It  is  apparent  from  the
         decision  that  the  Presenting  Officer  was  relying  on  several
         inconsistencies  in  the  sponsor's  written  and   oral   evidence
         (detailed at [11] of the judge's decision). Whilst  the  judge  may
         ultimately have been entitled to accept the  sponsor's  explanation
         for the additional deposits he was required to  have  engaged  with
         the respondent's concerns and give,  at  least  in  brief  form,  a
         reasoned explanation for rejecting those concerns.

     27. For these reasons I  am  satisfied  the  decision  is  infected  by
         material errors of law and must be set aside to be redetermined  at
         an entirely fresh hearing, all issues open.

Remittal to First-Tier Tribunal

     28. Under Part 3  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Practice
         Statement of the 18 June 2018 the case may be remitted to the First-
         tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

         (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before  the
            First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other  opportunity  for
            that party's case to be put to and considered by the  First-tier
            Tribunal; or


         (b) the nature or extent of any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
            necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be  re-made
            is such that, having regard to the overriding objective in  rule
            2, it is  appropriate  to  remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal.

     29. As highlighted in Judge Plimmer's directions of 16 September  2020,
         "... if the FTT decision is set aside, it I likely to be  necessary
         to  hear  oral  evidence  from  the  sponsor  and/or  his  employer
         regarding  the  evidence  relied  upon  regarding   the   financial
         requirements of the Immigration Rules." The effect of the error  is
         that the judge's findings are  not  sustainable  and  further/fresh
         evidence will need to be considered. In these circumstances  it  is
         appropriate to remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal for
         a fresh (de novo) hearing.

Notice of Decision

The making of the First-tier Tribunal's decision involved the making  of  an
error on a point of law and is set aside.

The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  decided  afresh
(de novo) by a judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Caskie.
