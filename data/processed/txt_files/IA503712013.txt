Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Bexson - Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Clark - Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Samuel Wesley-Quaison, a citizen  of  Ghana,  born
    25th January 1984.  He appeals against the decision of the Secretary of
    State made on 15th November 2013 to refuse to vary his leave to remain
    and to remove him from the United Kingdom by way  of  directions  under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The
    Appellant's appeal against that decision was initially heard by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Sanderson on 24th June 2014 and was  allowed.   The
    Secretary of State appealed against that decision  and  on  10th  March
    2015, having heard submissions, I found that there was a material error
    of law in the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I  set  Judge
    Sanderson's decision aside with no preserved findings of fact.

 2. The Appellant came to the UK in February 2012 with entry clearance as a
    visitor valid to 17th July 2012.  On 22nd May 2012 he married a British
    citizen, Benedicta Wesley- Quaison, and their first child was  born  on
    2nd February 2013.  A second child was born on  15th  July  2014.   The
    Tribunal was advised by a letter from the Appellant's solicitors on 2nd
    March 2015 that the Appellant's wife had enrolled on an extended  Human
    Resources Management Programme at Plymouth University  which  commenced
    on 9th February 2015 and was due to be completed in September 2017.  It
    was accepted at the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    Appellant could not  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  as  set  out  in
    Appendix FM because he only had leave to remain  as  a  visitor.  Judge
    Sanderson found that it would be unreasonable to expect  the  Appellant
    either to take his wife and child with him back to Ghana or  to  travel
    to Ghana to make a proper application for entry clearance.  I  set  the
    decision aside because I took the view that Judge Sanderson had  failed
    to consider all the relevant evidence.  In particular  he  had  allowed
    the appeal under Article 8 without any  consideration  at  all  of  the
    public interest, the need for effective immigration control in  the  UK
    or current caselaw relative to the relationship between the Immigration
    Rules and Article 8.

 3. I heard evidence from the Appellant who adopted a statement that he had
    prepared for the first hearing on 13th June 2014.  In that statement he
    says that he and his wife started to live together after he arrived  in
    the United Kingdom.  He talks of difficulties  she  had  in  her  first
    pregnancy.  She had had a previous miscarriage and other problems.  She
    had an eclamptic fit at the time of the birth of her first child.   The
    Appellant describes his previous  employment  and  qualifications.   He
    points out  that  his  wife  and  son  are  British  citizens  and  are
    permanently settled in the UK.  His wife has  been  in  employment  and
    supporting herself and her family and was at the time the statement was
    written expecting their second child.  He has no-one in Ghana.  He  has
    established a family and private life  in  the  UK.   He  has  provided
    letters from friends and family in support of his appeal.   He  submits
    that to remove him would give rise to a  breach  of  his  rights  under
    Article 8 ECHR.

 4. There is a bundle of documents confirming that the  couple  are  living
    together.

 5. In oral evidence the Appellant confirmed that his wife is working as  a
    Customer Services Assistant at Clapham Junction and is  earning  around
    �18,000 per annum.  At the  time  the  application  was  made  she  was
    earning between �21,000 and �23,000 after tax.   They  had  known  each
    other in Ghana as  children.   They  went  to  the  same  church.   His
    relationship with his wife began immediately  he  arrived  in  the  UK.
    Whilst they were both in Ghana they would talk on the phone  sometimes.
    He had been due to marry another woman in Ghana but his  fianc�e  broke
    off the relationship  three  months  before  the  wedding.   He  had  a
    business in Ghana and had applied to run an airline there.  He came  to
    the UK initially for his birthday celebration then  he  had  to  go  to
    Croatia.  He decided to get married.  He had been going to continue his
    business in Ghana but then they realised that his  wife  was  pregnant.
    They were worried that she would have another miscarriage  because  she
    had had one previously and he did not want to leave her.

 6. In cross-examination Mr Clark asked the Appellant why he cannot go back
    to Ghana to make an application for  entry  clearance.   The  Appellant
    said that he had a business there and the man who  was  running  it  is
    dead.  It would take three months to make an application and he has  no
    money or home there.  He was  living  with  his  grandmother  prior  to
    coming to the UK but she died last year.  He does not  know  where  his
    mother is and has no other relatives or friends  there.   Most  of  his
    friends live abroad.  He does not want to be separated  from  his  wife
    and children in order to return to make a fresh  application.   In  any
    event he looks after the children while his wife works.

 7. In his submissions Mr Clark said that the Appellant does not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  He came as a visitor so  cannot
    rely on Appendix FM including paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM.   He  said
    he would rely  on  the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  R  (on  the
    application of Chen) v SSHD  (Appendix  FM)  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary
    separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) in particular
    paragraph 39.  He submitted that the Tribunal is obliged to give weight
    to  the  public  interest.   It  is  irrelevant  that   the   financial
    requirements of the Rules may be met.  Little weight should be given to
    the Appellant's private life and indeed to the family life  established
    in the  circumstances.   He  submitted  that  Chikwamba  is  no  longer
    applicable to the Appellant's case.

 8. The submission of Miss Bexson was that to remove the Appellant would be
    grossly disproportionate.  It might take more than three months for him
    to get entry clearance.  The Appellant's wife's income has dropped  and
    it is not clear that the Appellant would be able to meet the  financial
    requirements if a fresh application had to be made.    The  Appellant's
    wife would have to stop working to look after the children.  These  are
    exceptional circumstances particularly  given  the  young  age  of  the
    children.  His wife  has been in employment for ten years.   They  have
    close family and friends.   She  has  paid  the  course  fees  for  her
    university course.  The children are at nursery.  She accepted that the
    relationship progressed very quickly to marriage and children  but  the
    Appellant has explained that.  He was going to do a  project  in  Ghana
    but because of his wife's problems with the pregnancy he could  not  do
    that.  It is in the best interests of the  children  to  be  with  both
    parents and it would not be  in  their  best  interests  either  to  be
    separated from their father or uprooted to live  in  Ghana  where  they
    would lose the support of the wider family in the UK.   She  relied  on
    the decision EB (Kosovo)  v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2008] UKHL 41, submitting that the separation of the family  would  be
    disproportionate.  She also submitted that the Appellant has no ties to
    Ghana and would thus qualify  for  leave  under  paragraph  276ADE(vi).
    Miss Bexson submitted that the balance tips in favour of the Appellant,
    taking into account the fact that they are an educated couple.  He  has
    a degree. They would not be a financial burden on the state.

 9. Mr Clark asked if he could make one more submission and  said  that  he
    would  wish  to  rely  on  the  decision  Bossadi  (paragraph   276ADE;
    suitability; ties) [2015] UKUT 42 (IAC) on the issue of 'ties' in one's
    country of origin.

My Findings

10. I have given careful consideration to all the evidence put before me in
    this case.

11. It is clear that  the  Appellant  cannot  rely  on  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM because he was here on a visit visa and this is  prohibited
    by paragraph E-LTRP.2.1(a).  As Miss Bexson conceded it is not clear on
    the figures available that in their current  circumstances  the  couple
    would meet the financial criteria set out in Appendix FM in any  event.
    I therefore proceed  to  consider  the  submissions  made  relative  to
    Article 8 ECHR.

12. In Razgar, R (on the Application of) v. Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2004] UKHL 27 (17 June 2004) the court said that there  are
    5 questions that must be asked in considering the question of a  breach
    of Article 8,

    (1)  Is there an interference with the right  to  respect  for  private
         life (which includes the right to respect for  physical  and  moral
         integrity) and family life?

    (2)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity as
         potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?

    (3)  Is that interference in accordance with the law?

    (4)  Does that interference have a legitimate aim?

    (5)  Is the interference proportionate in a democratic society  to  the
         legitimate aim to be achieved.

13. I accept that the couple are in a genuine  relationship  and  that  the
    Appellant enjoys both a family and a private life in the UK. I  do  not
    disagree with the factual analysis of  the  situation  set  out  by  Ms
    Bexson in her submissions.  I accept that the couple have two children,
    both British citizens, whose best interests have to be considered.

14. So far as the Immigration Rules are concerned I must consider paragraph
    276ADE which sets out the requirements for leave to remain in the UK on
    the basis of private life and states,

         '... that at the date of the application the applicant

             (i) does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in
             Section S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM;
             and

             (ii) has made a valid application for leave to remain on the
             grounds of private life in the UK; and

             (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years
             (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously
             in the UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of
             imprisonment) and it would not be reasonable to expect the
             applicant to leave the UK; or

             (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent
             at least half of his life living continuously in the UK
             (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (vi) is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the
             UK for less than 20 years (discounting any period of
             imprisonment) but has no ties (including social, cultural or
             family) with the country to which he would have to go if
             required to leave the UK.'

         (Sub-paragraph (vi) was amended  relative  to  all  decisions  made
         after 28th July 2014 but the version above is  that  applicable  to
         this case.)

15. In Bossadi the Tribunal said,

         "(2) The requirement set out in paragraph  276ADE  (vi)  (in  force
         from 9 July 2012 to 27 July 2014) to show that a person "is aged 18
         years or above, has lived continuously in the UK for less  than  20
         years (discounting any period of  imprisonment)  but  has  no  ties
         (including social, cultural or family) with the country to which he
         would have to go if required to leave the UK", requires  a  rounded
         assessment as to whether a person's familial ties could  result  in
         support to him in the event of his  return,  an  assessment  taking
         into account both subjective and objective considerations and  also
         consideration of what lies within  the  choice  of  a  claimant  to
         achieve."

16. I am unable to find in this case that the Appellant has  lost  ties  to
    Ghana.  He came here in 2012, having lived there prior to that.  Whilst
    it seemed to me that the Appellant appeared in general to be a credible
    witness, I think it is highly unlikely that he has  no-one  at  all  in
    Ghana as he stated.  I think it is highly unlikely that all his friends
    have left the country and that he  has  no  family  there.   He  had  a
    business there until fairly recently and had plans for a new venture. I
    find  that  he  does  not  meet  the  criteria  set  out  in  paragraph
    276ADE(vi).

17. In considering Article 8 I must take account  of  the  public  interest
    considerations set out at s.117B of the  Nationality  Immigration   and
    Asylum Act 2002, which reads,

         'Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
    public interest.

         (2) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society

         (3) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom.'

18. In considering s.117 B I have borne in mind the  guidance  set  out  in
    Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC). I note too that  paragraph  4
    refers to a relationship established whilst  a  person  is  in  the  UK
    unlawfully and paragraph 5 to  a  private  life  established  when  the
    person's immigration status is precarious.

19. The Tribunal said in AM  (S 117B) Malawi  [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC)

         "(3) Parliament has now  drawn  a  sharp  distinction  between  any
         period  of  time  during  which  a  person  has  been  in  the   UK
         "unlawfully", and any period of time  during  which  that  person's
         immigration status in the UK was merely "precarious".

         (4)  Those who at any given  date  held  a  precarious  immigration
         status must have held at that date an  otherwise  lawful  grant  of
         leave to enter or to  remain.  A  person's  immigration  status  is
         "precarious"  if  their  continued  presence  in  the  UK  will  be
         dependent upon their obtaining a further grant of leave."

20. It may well be that by virtue of s 3C Of the Immigration Act  1971  and
    the fact that he applied for a variation  of his leave on the  day  his
    visit visa was due  to  expire  the  Appellant  was  never  in  the  UK
    'unlawfully' but it cannot be disputed  that his leave was  precarious.
    Article 8 imposes no general obligation on a state  to  facilitate  the
    choice made by a married couple to reside in it: R (Quila) v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 45; [2012]  1  AC  621.  I
    bear in mind too that in such cases a relevant factor is whether or not
    the family can reasonably be expected to live elsewhere. I rely on  the
    findings in Secretary of State for the Home Department v SS  (Congo)  &
    Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387 (23 April 2015), particularly the following  at
    paragraph 39 in which the Court of Appeal set out  the  position  under
    Article 8 in relation to an application for LTE on the basis of  family
    life with a person already in the United Kingdom.  They said,

         "iv) On the other hand, the fact that the interests of a child  are
         in issue will be a countervailing factor which tends to  reduce  to
         some degree the width of the margin of appreciation which the state
         authorities would otherwise enjoy. Article 8 has to be  interpreted
         and applied in the light of the UN Convention on the Rights of  the
         Child (1989): see In re E (Children)  (Abduction:  Custody  Appeal)
         [2011] UKSC 27; [2012] AC 144, at [26]. However, the fact that  the
         interests of a child are in issue does not simply provide  a  trump
         card so that a child applicant for positive action to be  taken  by
         the state in the field of  Article  8(1)  must  always  have  their
         application acceded to; see In re  E  (Children)  at  [12]  and  ZH
         (Tanzania) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC
         4; [2011] 2  AC  166,  at  [25]  (under  Article  3(1)  of  the  UN
         Convention on the Rights of the Child the interests  of  the  child
         are a primary consideration - i.e. an important matter  -  not  the
         primary consideration). It is a factor relevant to the fair balance
         between the individual and the general community  which  goes  some
         way towards tempering the otherwise  wide  margin  of  appreciation
         available to the state authorities in deciding what to do. The  age
         of the child, the closeness of their relationship  with  the  other
         family member in the United Kingdom and whether  the  family  could
         live together elsewhere are likely to be  important  factors  which
         should be borne in mind.

         v) If family life can be carried on elsewhere, it is unlikely  that
         "a direct and immediate  link"  will  exist  between  the  measures
         requested by an applicant and his family life (Draon, para.  [106];
         Botta v Italy (1998) 26 EHRR 241, para. [35]), such as  to  provide
         the basis for an implied obligation upon the  state  under  Article
         8(1) to grant LTE; see also G�l v Switzerland, [42]. "

21. I accept that the Appellant does speak English and that  his  wife  has
    been supporting him and their children financially. I accept it  to  be
    likely that the Appellant would be able to earn a living in the UK. The
    fact is however that at the time he married his wife and undertook  and
    began to develop a family life in the UK, his leave to be here depended
    on a visit visa valid for six months which he knew would expire on 17th
    July 2012, less than two months after his  marriage  which  took  place
    only three months after he arrived in the UK.   There  is  no  evidence
    before me, either documentary or oral, to suggest that at the  time  of
    the decision to marry the Appellant gave any consideration at all to UK
    immigration law or about where they would live.  I It  seems  that  the
    assumption all along has been that because the Sponsor  is   a  British
    citizen with a job and a family here she could not be  expected  to  go
    with her husband to Ghana and nor should her children. So  far  as  the
    Appellant's private life is concerned there is no doubt that his  leave
    was precarious throughout the time of his relationship with  his  wife,
    their marriage and the births of  their  two  children.  Little  weight
    should therefore be given to his private life here.

22.  As British citizens the Appellant's children are  qualifying  children
    and so come within the terms of s.176B(6)(a). I must therefore consider
    whether it would be reasonable to expect  the  children  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom. The  starting  point  is  that  it  is  in  their  best
    interests to be with both parents. I  accept  that  the  children  have
    extended family in the UK.  Their mother originally came from Ghana  so
    the country would not be totally strange to  her.  She  may  well  have
    integrated into the UK but she is accustomed to the culture in Ghana as
    is the Appellant. The children are very young, the older being not  yet
    two and a half years old. It  is  difficult  to  conclude  that  it  is
    unreasonable to expect the children to leave the UK with  both  parents
    and live in Ghana or indeed that it is  unreasonable  to  expect  their
    mother to do so, especially in the circumstances that the Appellant and
    Sponsor knew each other in Ghana before coming here separately. I  have
    no evidence of the Appellant's former business in Ghana  other  than  a
    bare assertion that the man who was running it  has  died  and  I  have
    already said that I do not accept that he has no contacts,  friends  or
    family there.  I do not consider  that  there  are  any  insurmountable
    obstacles to his wife living with him in Ghana or that  there  are  any
    exceptional or compassionate family circumstances that would assist  in
    tipping the balance of proportionality in favour of the  Appellant  and
    warrant a grant of leave outwith the Immigration Rules. The Sponsor has
    recently enrolled on a course but I must take into account that she did
    this while her husband's appeal against a decision to  remove  him  was
    pending and when she was perfectly aware that there  was  no  guarantee
    that he would allowed to remain here.

23. I therefore find that the Appellant has not established that there need
    be any interference with his family life if he had to leave the  UK  as
    the family could move together to Ghana.  In the event  that  his  wife
    chose not to accompany him it seems to me that the  interference  would
    in all the circumstances be proportionate to  the  need  for  effective
    immigration control in the UK.

24. The other factor in this case, which was greatly  relied  upon  by  the
    Secretary of State, was the possibility of the Appellant  returning  to
    Ghana to seek entry clearance through the proper channels by making  an
    application to return to the UK as  a  partner  under  the  Immigration
    Rules. I have found that it would not be  unreasonable  for  the  whole
    family to go to Ghana but in the event that the Appellant's wife  chose
    not to go discussion of the interference to family life that the making
    of a fresh application would necessitate may be relevant.

25.  Miss Bexson relied on the decision Chikwamba v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2008] UKHL 40 in which the House  of  Lords  noted
    the then extant policy of the Respondent that :

         "A person who claims that he will not qualify for  entry  clearance
         under the rules is not in any better position  than  a  person  who
         does qualify under the rules-he is  still  expected  to  apply  for
         entry clearance..."

    Lord Brown in the House of Lords said,

         "I am far from  suggesting  that  the  Secretary  of  State  should
         routinely apply this policy in all but exceptional cases. Rather it
         seems to me that only comparatively  rarely,  certainly  in  family
         cases involving children, should an article 8 appeal  be  dismissed
         on the basis that it would be proportionate  and  more  appropriate
         for the appellant to apply for leave from abroad."

26. In Chen, a recent decision of this Tribunal, it was said,

         "(i) Appendix FM does not include  consideration  of  the  question
         whether it would be disproportionate to  expect  an  individual  to
         return to his home country to make an entry  clearance  application
         to re-join family members in the U.K. There may be cases  in  which
         there are no insurmountable obstacles to family life being  enjoyed
         outside the U.K.  but  where  temporary  separation  to  enable  an
         individual to make  an  application  for  entry  clearance  may  be
         disproportionate. In all cases, it will be for  the  individual  to
         place before the Secretary of State evidence  that  such  temporary
         separation will interfere disproportionately with protected rights.
         It will not be enough to rely solely upon the  case-law  concerning
         Chikwamba  v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40."

          (ii) Lord Brown was not laying down a legal test when he suggested
         in Chikwamba  that requiring a claimant to make an application  for
         entry clearance would only "comparatively rarely" be  proportionate
         in a case involving children (per Burnett J, as he then was,  in  R
         (Kotecha and Das) v SSHD [2011] EWHC 2070 (Admin))."

27. Mr Clark relied in particular on paragraph 39 in which Judge Gill said:



         "In my judgement, if it is shown by an individual (the burden being
         upon him or her) that  an  application  for  entry  clearance  from
         abroad would  be  granted  and  that  there  would  be  significant
         interference with family life by temporary removal, the  weight  to
         be accorded to the formal requirement of obtaining entry  clearance
         is reduced.  In  cases  involving  children,  where  removal  would
         interfere with the child's enjoyment of family  life  with  one  or
         other of his or her parents whilst entry clearance is obtained,  it
         will be easier to show that the balance on proportionality falls in
         favour of the claimant than in cases which do not involve  children
         but where removal interferes with family life between  parties  who
         knowingly entered into  the  relationship  in  the  knowledge  that
         family life was being established whilst the immigration status  of
         one party was 'precarious'.  In other words, in the former case, it
         would be easier to show that the  individual's  circumstances  fall
         within the minority envisaged by the House of Lords in Huang or the
         exceptions referred to in judgments of the ECtHR than in the latter
         case.  However, it all depends on the facts."

28. The Appellant does not meet the Immigration Rules. He  entered  into  a
    marriage and family life in the UK at a time when he was aware that  he
    had very limited leave to remain here and would have  to  apply  for  a
    grant of leave. For the reasons set out above I do not accept  that  he
    has no ties to Ghana or that he knows no one there.  His  children  are
    very young and there is extended family in the UK to assist  his  wife.
    I accept that  if  the  Appellant  had  to  go  to  Ghana  to  make  an
    application there would be an interference with their family life and I
    accept that it may interfere with the Sponsor's course. It was  put  to
    me that it might interfere with her employment as the  Appellant  looks
    after the children but I do not give great weight to that  in  all  the
    circumstances.  I must take into account that the  Appellant  made  the
    decision to marry and initiate a family life  in  this  country  having
    obtained leave to come as a visitor for a limited period.  Having  done
    so he was bound by the legal requirements applicable to all who  whilst
    in the UK with only limited leave wish to marry a British citizen.

29. I find therefore that it would not be disproportionate to the need  for
    effective immigration control to expect  the  Appellant  to  return  to
    Ghana to make an application through the proper channels.
