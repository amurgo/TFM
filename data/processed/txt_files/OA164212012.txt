Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr Y Darboe, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission on
      17 July 2013 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson in respect of  the
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Mitchell who dismissed  the
      appeal by way of a determination promulgated on 14 June 2013.

   2.       The appellant is the wife of the sponsor, Ansu Jadamu. Her  date
      of birth is 25 March 1974 and she is a Gambian national.  The  sponsor
      is also of Gambian origin. He entered the UK as a visitor in September
      2003, overstayed, married and divorced  and  eventually  obtained  ILR
      through another marriage to a woman he also subsequently divorced.  He
      married the appellant in November 2011 but it is said  they  had  been
      previously married in 1994 and had two daughters.

   3.       On 19 July 2012 the ECO refused  the  application.  He  was  not
      satisfied that  the  marriage  was  subsisting  or  that  the  parties
      intended to live together, nor was he  satisfied  that  the  appellant
      would be adequately maintained or  accommodated.  He  also  considered
      that the decision was justified and proportionate in the interests  of
      maintaining effective immigration control. Judge Mitchell  heard  oral
      evidence from the sponsor and concluded that although the marriage was
      genuine and subsisting, it had not be  shown  that  accommodation  was
      adequate or that the appellant would be maintained without recourse to
      public funds.

   4.       Permission to appeal was granted on the  basis  that  the  judge
      arguably misapplied the  guidance  of  KA  (adequacy  of  maintenance)
      Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 in that the sponsor's  income  was  higher
      than the minimum income support allowance. It was also argued for  the
      appellant that the judge failed  to  take  account  of  the  sponsor's
      Barclays bank account and that in any event he was wrong to have taken
      maintenance as an issue because that point had been  conceded  by  the
      ECM in a review.

Appeal hearing

   5.       The appeal came  before  me  on  28  August  2013.  The  sponsor
      attended the hearing. An interpreter was  booked  at  the  appellant's
      request but in the event was not required as  the  sponsor  spoke  and
      understood English.

   6.       I heard submissions from Mr Darboe. He  argued  that  the  judge
      erred in not applying KA. He submitted that the  sponsor  earned  over
      ï¿½25,000 and based on that figure the judge should have been  satisfied
      that adequate maintenance was available.  He  further  submitted  that
      although the sponsor currently spent all his money, he would not do so
      if the appellant joined him. He argued that in any event the rules did
      not require a certain figure to be available in the sponsor's  account
      and that he had an overdraft facility to rely upon.  He submitted that
      although the sponsor was sending money to Gambia every month  for  the
      building of his house, he would stop doing that if the alternative was
      that his wife would starve here. The final argument was that  the  ECM
      had conceded the maintenance issue.

   7.       Mr Jarvis responded. He submitted that there was no error in the
      determination. The problem for the appellant was that the case had not
      been properly put and could not now be re-argued on  issues  that  had
      been overlooked. KA had been misquoted;  the  issue  was  not  just  a
      notional income but the availability of  funds  for  maintenance.  The
      sponsor's  oral  evidence  of  outgoings  was  inconsistent  with  the
      documentary evidence. There was no evidence to support the  submission
      that the sponsor would change his spending habits if the appellant was
      admitted. He may be committed to continue with the  payments  for  his
      house. An overdraft was not an acceptable means of maintenance  as  it
      could be withdrawn at any time; Adeyemi-Doro [2011] EWCA Civ  849  was
      relied upon. The burden had not been discharged.

   8.       In reply, Mr Darboe repeated his submission that  the  sponsor's
      income was sufficient to meet maintenance costs.

   9.       At the conclusion of the hearing I dismissed the appeal.  I  now
      give my reasons.

Conclusions

  10.        I do not accept that the respondent made the concession that is
      alleged by the appellant's representatives. Indeed, I cannot  see  how
      they interpreted his review as a concession of any kind. In his review
      the ECM states:

      "The grounds of appeal seek to address the main concerns of the ECO as
      detailed in the refusal notice in the form of bank statements, housing
      information and payslips. There is still no documentary  support  that
      evidences that the couple have  been  in  a  sustainable  relationship
      since 1992...The grounds of appeal do not satisfactorily  address  the
      reasons for the decision as detailed in the ECO's notice  of  refusal.
      No new, original,  independent  documentation  has  been  produced  as
      evidence to tip  the  balance  of  probabilities  in  the  appellant's
      favour. I have not been persuaded to reverse the original decision".

  11.       I cannot see that any concession was made by the respondent. Had
      the maintenance and accommodation issues  been  conceded,  this  would
      have been made clear. It is plain  from  the  review  that  the  ECO's
      reasons for refusal were all maintained. It follows  that  maintenance
      and accommodation were live issues.

  12.       With regard to accommodation, the only evidence adduced is for a
      short term tenancy in someone else's name with the sponsor named as an
      occupant. There was no evidence to confirm the amount of his rent,  no
      evidence that it was paid and no evidence of the size of the  property
      or whether the landlord had agreed to the appellant  living  there  or
      whether that would change the amount of rent due. The judge considered
      the issue of accommodation at paragraphs 24 and 25 and concluded  that
      adequate accommodation was not available. There has been no  challenge
      to this finding in the  grounds  for  permission  to  appeal.  When  I
      pointed this out to Mr Darboe, his response was  that  he  would  have
      argued that at a re-hearing. That rather  misses  the  point.  In  the
      absence of any challenge to the finding that one of  the  requirements
      of paragraph 281 has not been met, the appeal cannot succeed under the
      Immigration Rules regardless of the merit, if any,  on  the  issue  of
      maintenance. On that basis the judge's decision to dismiss the  appeal
      stands. There can be  no  re-hearing.  Had  the  appellant  wanted  to
      challenge the accommodation finding, this should have been  raised  in
      the grounds or at the hearing by way of an  application  to  vary  the
      grounds. Neither was done.

  13.       The issue on maintenance  therefore  becomes  academic  in  that
      context. However, for the sake of completion, I consider the argument.
      I accept that in many cases, it would  be  enough  to  show  that  the
      sponsor earned over and above the income support level of  maintenance
      (at least under the old rules). However, as Mr Jarvis  submitted,  the
      sponsor's income cannot be looked at in isolation. His outgoings  must
      also be considered to assess whether funds would be available for  the
      appellant's  support.  The  judge  took  account  of  the  documentary
      evidence and the sponsor's oral evidence.  Plainly  the  two  did  not
      accord with each other. He noted that despite the sponsor's  claim  of
      low outgoings, he was consistently overdrawn almost to  the  limit  of
      his overdraft and occasionally above it and had no money to spare. The
      grounds  make  reference  to  a  Barclays  bank  statement  which  was
      allegedly overlooked by the judge but no such statement appears in any
      of the bundles. The sponsor has  no  savings  and  his  outgoings  are
      consistently higher than his income.  On  that  basis  the  judge  was
      entitled to find that his finances were precarious and  that  adequate
      maintenance would not be available for the appellant without  recourse
      to public funds.

  14.       Mr Darboe submitted that it was perverse for the judge to assume
      that the sponsor would continue to send money for the building of  his
      house in Gambia if it meant his wife would starve here and that it was
      obvious  that  the  sponsor  would  change  his  spending  habits   if
      necessary. The judge did, however, consider whether that might  happen
      but found that no evidence to that effect had been called. As such, it
      remains a submission and nothing more. Mr  Jarvis  is  also  right  to
      point out that there was no evidence as to  whether  the  sponsor  was
      committed to paying a certain amount  for  his  house  in  Gambia.  No
      evidence was called on that point either and it may well be  that  the
      sponsor is not in a position to cease payments  without  penalty.  The
      reliance  on  an  overdraft  facility  is  not  acceptable  given  its
      unreliability.

  15.       I have taken KA into account when assessing the determination of
      the First-tier Tribunal. As pointed out by Mr Jarvis, the Tribunal did
      not simply take the sponsor's income into account  in  that  case;  it
      also considered his financial commitments and ability to save.

  16.       The difficulty for the  appellant  in  this  case  is  that  the
      evidence has not been properly put. It may be that the sponsor is just
      a spendthrift and could curb his extravagances if necessary, or it may
      be that he has a lot more financial obligations than he let on; we  do
      not know as his  commitments,  expenditure  and  intentions  were  not
      explored at the hearing. Although Mr Darboe asked me to  look  at  the
      Record of Proceedings for confirmation  that  the  sponsor  was  asked
      whether he  could  change  his  spending  habits,  I  cannot  see  any
      reference to such evidence  in  the  judge's  transcript.   Where  the
      sponsor's evidence shows that he is just scraping by on his income and
      a generous overdraft, attempts should have been made  to  clarify  his
      financial situation as part of the preparation for the  case.  On  the
      available evidence the  judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  adequate
      maintenance would not be available in the particular circumstances  of
      this case.

  17.       However, as explained earlier, even if the  judge  had  made  an
      error in his approach to maintenance, this would  not  result  in  the
      determination being set aside as his finding on accommodation  remains
      unchallenged and on that basis the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
      Rules have not been met.

  18.       There has been no challenge to the Article 8 findings.

Decision

  19.       The First-tier Tribunal did not make  any  errors  of  law.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  on
      Article 8 grounds stands.
