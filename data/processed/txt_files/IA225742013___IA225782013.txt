For the Appellants:    Mr K Wyn on behalf of Liyon Legal Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against  the  decision  of  Judge  Murray.   We  have
    considered carefully the submissions  which  have  been  made  by  both
    parties in relation to the matters which this Tribunal felt  should  be
    raised at the outset of this appeal.  On the basis of these submissions
    we hold that the case does not exhibit any material error of law.


    (i)  The issue which was sought to be raised today,  namely:  financial
         dependency arising from the appellant  residing  in  the  sponsor's
         house in  Sri  Lanka,  was  not  an  issue  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal.  The evidence regarding this issue was not placed  before
         the First-tier Tribunal Judge by either representative.  There  was
         no  argument  based  on   this   evidence   presented   by   either
         representative.


    (ii) Neither in relation to financial dependency, nor even in  relation
         to the appellant being a member of the household of the sponsor was
         evidence relative to her residence  in  this  house  sought  to  be
         adduced and relied upon by either representative.


    (iii)    The point which is now sought to be  made  arising  from  this
         evidence is not  Robinson obvious, that is the  judge  should  have
         known it even if the representatives did not.

2.   For these reasons we refuse the appeal.





Signed                                  Date


Lord Bannatyne
Sitting as a Judge of the Upper Tribunal
