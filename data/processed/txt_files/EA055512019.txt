For the Appellant:     Mr Iqbal, Counsel instructed by Muhammad Raza
For the Respondent:    Mr Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

This  has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has   been   consented   to by
the parties. The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face to
face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all  issues
could  be  determined  in  a  remote  hearing.  I  did  not  experience  any
difficulties, and neither party expressed any concern, with the process.


                                CONSENT ORDER

    1. Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules
       2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

        a. Upon the  parties  agreeing  that  the  decision  of  First-Tier
           Tribunal Judge Bulpitt promulgated on 8 January  2020  discloses
           an error of law and should be set aside.

        b. And upon the parties agreeing that the appeal should be remitted
           to the First-tier Tribunal, with no findings of fact preserved.

        c. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside  for  legal
           error and the appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  to
           be made afresh by a different judge with no findings preserved.
