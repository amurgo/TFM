                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of Judge of the
        First-tier Tribunal Callow (FtJ), promulgated on 17 November  2016,
        allowing the respondent's appeal against the  appellant's  decision
        of 07 October 2016 to refuse her human rights claim (in the form of
        an  application  for  settlement  under  paragraph  276B   of   the
        immigration rules based on 10 years continuous lawful residence).






   Factual Background


     2. The appellant is a national of the Ivory Coast, date  of  birth  18
        February 1981. Her immigration history was accurately summarised by
        the FtJ at paragraph 4 of his decision.

          The [respondent] arrived in the UK on  2  June  2003  with  entry
          clearance as a student valid until 21 November  2003.  Thereafter
          she made in time renewals to extend her student  leave  until  31
          May 2011. She was then expecting to re-sit an examination  but  a
          university considered that her circumstances did not warrant  the
          issue of a sponsorship letter. It was in these circumstances that
          she sought relief to remain outside the rules in order to  settle
          the outstanding examination. On 31  May  2011  she  submitted  an
          application for leave to  remain  outside  the  rules.  This  was
          rejected as invalid on 20 June 2011 as  the  form  had  not  been
          signed by the [respondent]. As a result of  the  application  was
          returned and arrangements were made  to  return  the  application
          fee. On 24 June 2011 she made another application founded on  the
          same grounds but which was refused by the [appellant] on 21  July
          2011. Her appeal (IA/22882/2011) to the First-tier  Tribunal  was
          dismissed on 16 September 2011. She  was  granted  permission  to
          appeal to the Upper Tribunal which was listed for hearing  on  20
          February 2012. As the [respondent] had received  her  MBA  degree
          certificate four days before the hearing in the  Upper  Tribunal,
          she decided to make an application  for  a  Post-Study  visa  and
          notified the Upper Tribunal  that  she  wished  to  withdraw  her
          appeal which was consented to on 17 February 2012. On 16 February
          2012 the [respondent]  submitted  an  application  for  leave  to
          remain as a Tier 1 Post Study Work Migrant which was  refused  on
          the 24 September 2012 with no right of  appeal  as  it  was  then
          believed  the  [respondent]  had  an  extant  appeal  before  the
          Tribunal. Subsequent to the  receipt  of  a  pre-action  protocol
          letter the [appellant] agreed to reconsider the said  application
          of 16 February 2012 leading to the grant of leave to remain as  a
          Tier 1 Post Study Migrant on 9 July 2013 until 9 July 2015. On 31
          March 2015 the [respondent] made application [SIC] for indefinite
          leave to remain on  the  basis  of  10  years  continuous  lawful
          residence.

      The Reasons For Refusal Letter

     3. In her decision dated 7 October 2015 the appellant noted  that  the
        respondent's application of 24 June 2011 had been submitted out  of
        time and was refused with no right of appeal on 21 July  2011.  The
        appellant acknowledged that the respondent lodged  an  appeal  with
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) but  maintained  that  it
        erroneously accepted jurisdiction on 3 August 2011. Where an appeal
        is lodged, whether 'in' or 'out-of-time' against the refusal of  an
        out-of-time application, leave was not be  extended  by  virtue  of
        section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 as there was no valid  leave
        to extend. The appellant noted that following  the  expiry  of  the
        respondent's leave on 31 May 2011 she did  not  seek  to  vary  her
        leave with a valid application until 24 June 2011.  Throughout  her
        appeal process she was without lawful leave. As she was not granted
        a further period of leave until 19 July 2013 she  had  remained  an
        overstayer for approximately 2 years. The appellant explained that,
        for the purposes of the grant of leave to remain on  9  July  2013,
        she had exercised her  discretion  and  overlooked  the  procedural
        errors. In reaching her decision the appellant  considered  whether
        to  exercise  her  discretion  in  accordance  with  her  published
        guidance 'Long Residence and Private Life' but concluded, given the
        length of overstaying, that it  was  not  appropriate  to  exercise
        discretion in the respondent's favour.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

     4. The FtJ heard brief evidence from the respondent and  the  parties'
        submissions. at [8] of his decision the FtJ stated,

          Save for the issue as to whether or not the  [respondent]  had  a
          right of appeal following the decision of 21 July 2011 addressing
          the [respondent's] application of 24 June 2011, the facts in this
          matter of common cause. In the absence of evidence that there was
          no right of appeal, I attach weight to the fact  that  an  appeal
          was noted and heard and was therefore the subject  of  a  further
          appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

     5. Having set out the relevant provisions of paragraph 276A  and  276B
        of the immigration rules, and section 3C  of  the  Immigration  Act
        1971, and having noted the authority of JH (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2009]
        EWCA Civ 78, and that the appeal of Mirza [2015] EWCA Civ  838  was
        pending before the Supreme Court, the FtJ concluded, at [13],

          I find that there has been no unlawful gap in the  continuity  of
          the [respondent's] residence since her arrival in  the  UK  as  a
          student on 2 June 2003. The application of the 24 June 2011 after
          the expiry of her visa on the 31 May 2011 wherein she then became
          an overstayer, was made  within  the  grace  period  of  28  days
          provided for in 276B(v). As there was  an  appeal  following  the
          refusal of the 24 June 2011 [sic] she had  3C  leave  up  to  the
          withdrawal of her appeal on the 17 February 2012 and  thereafter,
          having immediately applied for the Post-Study Migrant visa, until
          its issue on 9 July 2013.

The basis of the appeal

     6. The appellant contends that the FtJ misapplied the law relating  to
        extension of leave under section 3C of the  Immigration  act  1971.
        The FtJ was not lawfully entitled to conclude that the respondent's
        application of 24 June 2011 was made when she had  valid  leave  to
        remain. In other words, the FtJ was  wrong  to  conclude  that  the
        decision of 24 June 2011 was  made  in  time.  The  grounds  relied
        extensively on  the  reasoning  contained  within  the  appellant's
        Reasons For Refusal Letter of 07 October 2015, as did  Mr  Nath  in
        his oral submissions. Permission was granted on the basis  that  it
        was arguable that the FtJ made a material ever of  law  in  holding
        that there had been "no unlawful  gap  in  the  continuity  of  the
        [respondent's] residence since her arrival in the UK as  a  student
        on 2 June 2003" given that section 3C  can  only  extend  leave  to
        remain where there is valid leave to extend. Mr Nath submitted that
        the case was not about the 28 day grace period under paragraph 276B
        (v) but about whether the respondent had 3C leave or not  following
        her invalid application of 31 May 2011.


     7. For his part Mr Chakmakjian submitted that the burden  rested  with
        the appellant to demonstrate that the application of 24  June  2011
        was not made "in time" given the willingness of the AIT  to  accept
        jurisdiction, which it could only do if  the  application  to  vary
        leave was made in time. Although the appellant was not  represented
        in the hearing before the  AIT  she  had  an  opportunity  to  make
        written submissions concerning the issue of jurisdiction. The FtJ's
        findings at [8] concerning the  extension  of  3C  leave  when  the
        application of 24 June 2011 was made were rationally open  to  him.
        Ultimately it was for the appellant to demonstrate that the AIT did
        not have jurisdiction and she failed  to  do  so.  It  was  further
        submitted that the effect of paragraph 276B(v) of  the  immigration
        rules was to discount the period of 24 days between the  expiry  of
        the respondent's leave on 31 May 2011 and her valid application  on
        24 June 2011 and to, in effect, bestow upon  the  respondent  valid
        leave.

      Discussion

     8. Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971, at the  material  time,  as
        substituted by section 118  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002 (and amended by  section  11  of  the  Immigration,
        Asylum and Nationality Act 2006), read as follows:
         3C Continuation of leave pending variation decision
         (1) This section applies if -
         (a) a person who has limited leave to enter or remain in the
         United Kingdom applies to the Secretary of State for variation of
         the leave,
         (b) the application for variation is made before the leave
         expires, and
         (c) the leave expires without the application for variation having
         been decided.
         (2) The leave is extended by virtue of this section during any
         period when -
         (a) the application for variation is neither decided nor
         withdrawn, ...
         (3) Leave extended by virtue of this section shall lapse if the
         applicant leaves the United Kingdom.
         (4) A person may not make an application for variation of his
         leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom while that leave is
         extended by virtue of this section.
         (5) But subsection (4) does not prevent the variation of the
         application mentioned in subsection (1)(a).
     9. At the material date paragraph 276B of the immigration  rules  read
        as follows:

          The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite leave
          to remain on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom
          are that:


             (i) (a) he  has  had  at  least  10  years  continuous  lawful
             residence in the United Kingdom.

             (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons
             why it would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite
             leave to remain on the ground of long residence, taking into
             account his:
             (a) age; and
             (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and
             (c) personal history, including character, conduct,
             associations and employment record; and
             (d) domestic circumstances; and
             (e) compassionate circumstances; and
             (f) any representations received on the person's behalf; and

             (iii) the applicant does not fall for refusal under the
             general grounds for refusal.


             (iv) the applicant has demonstrated sufficient knowledge of
             the English language and sufficient knowledge about life in
             the United Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.


             (v) the  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
             immigration laws except that any period of overstaying  for  a
             period of 28 days or less will be  disregarded,  as  will  any
             period of overstaying  between  periods  of  entry  clearance,
             leave to enter or leave to remain of up to  28  days  and  any
             period  of  overstaying  pending  the  determination   of   an
             application made within that 28 day period.

    10. It is necessary to revisit in some detail the chronology of  events
        in 2011. It is not in dispute that the respondent's leave,  granted
        to her on 19 March 2010 as a Tier 4 (General) Student,  expired  on
        31 May 2011. It  is  not  disputed  that  the  respondent  made  an
        application  on  that  date  for  leave  to  remain   outside   the
        immigration rules. It is not in dispute that this  application  was
        invalid and was rejected by the respondent as invalid 20 June 2011.
        The  respondent  failed  to  sign  a   declaration,   a   mandatory
        requirement for  a  valid  application.  This  factual  matrix  was
        accepted by both parties and by the FtJ.


    11. In Mirza [2015] EWCA Civ 838 the Court of  Appeal  (at  [30])  held
        that section 3C did not extend to  an  application  which  was  not
        validly  made  in  accordance  with  the  immigration  rules.  This
        decision was upheld by the  Supreme  Court  (see  R(Mirza)  v  SSHD
        [2016] UKSC 63). In their judgement the Supreme  Court  stated  (at
        [33]), "In ordinary language an application which  is  not  validly
        made can have no substantive effect."


    12. Given that the respondent's application made on 31 May 2011 was not
        valid, she ceased to have leave after that date. She was  therefore
        present in the UK without leave from 1 June 2011. Although she made
        a valid application on 24 June 2011, some 24 days after  her  leave
        expired,  the  fact  remains  that  she  had  no  leave  when  that
        application was made. This much is clear from  the  undisputed  and
        unchallenged immigration  history  and  the  ordinary  language  of
        section 3C, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Mirza. This  was
        also the view of the appellant when she issued a Notice of Decision
        refusing to grant the respondent leave to remain on 21  July  2011.
        This decision read, in material part,


             An application was made on your behalf on the 24 June 2011.
             However, your leave to remain expired on the 31 May 2011. You
             therefore did not have leave to remain at the time of your
             application.
             Your application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom has
             been refused and you no longer have any known basis of stay
             here. There is no right of appeal against this refusal.


    13. Mr Chakmakjian points to the apparent  acceptance  by  the  AIT  of
        jurisdiction to hear the appeal  lodged  by  the  respondent  on  3
        August 2011. He submits  that  the  AIT  could  not  have  accepted
        jurisdiction in relation to that appeal (which related to a refusal
        to vary leave) unless the respondent's leave  to  remain  had  been
        extended by virtue of section 3C, and that the FtJ was entitled  to
        this finding as the burden rested with the appellant to prove  that
        the AIT did not have jurisdiction.


    14. I cannot accept these submissions. Mr Chakmakjian could not produce
        any authority to support his contention  that,  in  determining  an
        issue of jurisdiction, the burden rests on the  appellant.  In  any
        event, the question whether  leave  to  remain  has  been  extended
        pursuant to section 3C is to be discerned by  direct  reference  to
        the Immigration Act 1971 and the undisputed chronology  of  events.
        There is no indication on the papers before me that  the  issue  of
        jurisdiction was specifically considered by  the  AIT,  although  I
        accept that such consideration should  have  been  given  when  the
        appeal was lodged. Even if specific consideration was given by  the
        AIT to the issue of jurisdiction, it is extremely difficult,  given
        the unchallenged factual, chronological and legislative matrix,  to
        discern how the AIT could have legitimately accepted  jurisdiction.
        The lower Tribunal has, albeit on rare occasions, made mistakes  in
        respect of jurisdiction. In any event, and on a proper analysis  of
        the chronology and the relevant provisions of primary  legislation,
        as interpreted by the highest Court, the respondent's leave expired
        on 1 June 2011. It was therefore not open to the  FtJ  to  conclude
        that the respondent's leave had been extended pursuant  to  section
        3C on the basis that the AIT had accepted jurisdiction.


    15. The fact that the respondent made a valid application  on  24  June
        2011, within 28 days of her previous leave expiring, does not  have
        the effect of bestowing upon her leave pursuant to section 3C.  The
        28 day 'grace period' prevented the respondent's application of  24
        June 2011 from being refused merely because it was lodged  slightly
        out of time. It did not have the effect  of  extending  leave  when
        none existed. Although the respondent lodged an  appeal  within  28
        days of the refusal, dated  21  July  2011,  of  her  validly  made
        application, she did not have valid leave at that stage. Given that
        the respondent had no valid leave on 24 June 2011, she had no leave
        that could be extended when her appeal  was  lodged.  She  did  not
        lodge another application until  16  February  2012,  and  was  not
        granted law for leave until 9 July 2013.


    16. In light of this analysis, I am satisfied that the  FtJ  materially
        erred in law in concluding that there had been no unlawful  gap  in
        the continuity of the  respondent's  residence.  The  FtJ  was  not
        entitled to this conclusion based on the legislative framework  and
        the facts before him. Applying the relevant law to  the  chronology
        of events I find that the respondent had no leave  between  1  June
        2011 and 9 July 2013.


    17. Although the respondent's application for settlement on  the  basis
        of long residence was framed by reference to paragraph 276B, it was
        properly treated by the appellant, consistently  with  her  Appeals
        Policy, as a human rights claim. The  respondent  was  entitled  to
        appeal the appellant's decision because it was a refusal of a human
        rights claim. In her decision of 07 October 2015 the appellant went
        on to consider  the  respondent's  private  and  family  life  with
        reference to paragraph 276ADE  and  Appendix  FM  on  the  evidence
        before her. There has been no consideration of these provisions  by
        the FtJ with respect to the respondent's circumstances at the  date
        of the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  In  these  circumstances,  and
        with the agreement of both representatives, it  is  appropriate  to
        remit this  matter  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  enable  full
        consideration of all other relevant factors in respect of the human
        rights claim.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made a material error of law.
The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  fresh  hearing,
having regard to the conclusions of  the  Upper  Tribunal,  before  a  judge
other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Callow.

I make no anonymity direction.
