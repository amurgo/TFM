For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Thailand born on 26  August  1985,  appeals
    against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Meah  who  in  a
    determination promulgated on 29 January 2014 dismissed the  appellant's
    appeal against a decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer,  Bangkok  to
    refuse her leave to enter as the  child  of  her  mother,  Ms  Nutnicha
    Cynberg.

2.   The application had been refused on 14 November 2012.   In  making  the
    decision to refuse the Entry Clearance Officer noted that the appellant
    had always lived with her grandmother, her mother  having  taken  three
    months off at the time of  her  birth  to  return  to  the  appellant's
    grandmother's home.  The appellant's mother had returned to her work in
    a different province and the appellant had been left in  the  full-time
    care of her grandmother.  Her mother had always  lived  away  from  the
    family home until four months before she settled in  Britain  with  the
    appellant's stepfather in April  2010.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    stated that in the appellant's entire life she had only lived with  her
    mother for a period of seven months.

3.   The Entry Clearance Officer noted  that  the  appellant's  parents  had
    separated when she was approximately 4 years  old.   Her  father  would
    visit her during the annual New Year festivities and take  her  to  her
    paternal grandparents' home which was only a twenty minutes' walk  from
    where she was living.

4.   The Entry Clearance Officer went on to say that the appellant  attended
    a school chosen by her grandmother and travelled  to  and  from  school
    with her 17 year old cousin who also lived with her.   Her  grandmother
    and cousin attended parent/teacher events and her cousin signed her end
    of term reports.  Her cousin would assist her when she needed help with
    her homework tasks.  Her maternal grandmother would  consult  with  her
    paternal grandmother about her  welfare  and  decisions  affecting  her
    everyday life.  The Entry Clearance Officer noted  that  the  appellant
    was in education, was not in need of medical treatment and indeed  that
    the appellant's mother had only travelled  to  Thailand  on  one  brief
    occasion between February 2011 and  March  2011  since  she  had  first
    settled in Britain.  The Entry Clearance Officer  considered  therefore
    that the appellant did not meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules in that she had not shown that her mother had sole responsibility
    for her.

5.   Judge Meah, having noted the terms of the  refusal  and  the  terms  of
    paragraph 295 of the Immigration Rules, referred to  the  determination
    in the case of TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e):  "sole  responsibility")  Yemen
    [2006] UKAIT 00049.

6.   He considered the evidence given to him by the sponsor and her  husband
    who had chosen not to  seek  legal  representation.   He  accepted  the
    appellant's mother's statement that she had been sending ï¿½200  a  month
    for the appellant's maintenance and upkeep since  she  had  arrived  in
    Britain and that she spoke to the appellant regularly on the telephone.
     The appellant's mother had told the judge  that  she  was  working  in
    Bangkok when the appellant was born.  Bangkok was a four  hour  journey
    away but the appellant's mother would return to see the appellant every
    month when she was able to secure two consecutive  days  off  from  her
    employment.  He noted the fact that the appellant's mother stated  that
    she and the appellant's grandmother had made a joint decision regarding
    the appellant's nursery school and the judge concluded, in paragraph 13
    that major decisions in the appellant's life, including decisions about
    her education  and  schooling,  had  "consistently  been  made  jointly
    following extensive discussion and consultation between the appellant's
    mother and her grandmother".  He stated that the appellant's mother had
    explained that discussion would take place and in  most  instances  her
    own mother would accede to her wishes.  He stated that:

         "This to me indicates that any decision made by them was  following
         detailed consultation between the  two  of  them  rather  than  the
         decisions solely being made by the appellant's mother."

7.   Having quoted paragraphs  49  and  50  from  the  determination  in  TD
    (Yemen) the  judge  stated  that  following  the  appellant's  mother's
    evidence he found that the responsibility had been shared  between  her
    and her  mother.   The  appellant  had  been  under  the  care  of  her
    grandmother effectively since birth and was now aged 8  and  had  lived
    with her grandmother  all  her  life  and  that  had  resulted  in  the
    grandmother inevitably making some very important significant decisions
    in the appellant's life. He therefore  found  that  responsibility  was
    shared between the appellant's mother and grandmother as opposed to the
    appellant's mother having had sole responsibility for her.   The  judge
    found the appellant's mother and her husband to be witnesses  of  truth
    and accepted the evidence that  the  appellant's  grandmother  was  now
    aging and that was part of the reason why the appellant's mother wished
    her  to  come  to  Britain.   The  appellant's  grandmother   is   also
    responsible for six other children  belonging  to  her  son  and  other
    daughter.

8.   The judge set out his findings on the appellant's rights under  Article
    8 of the ECHR in paragraphs 19 and 20.  Having noted that Article 8 had
    not been relied on in the grounds of appeal he  considered  it  in  the
    interests  of  completeness  and  bearing  in  mind  the  sponsor   was
    unrepresented at the hearing.  He noted that the Presenting Officer had
    argued that Article 8 would not be breached as  the  status  quo  would
    simply be maintained.  He went on to say:

         "I find the assessment is one of proportionality and  I  accept  Ms
         Fortescue's [the Presenting Officer's] argument under the banner of
         Article 8.  The appellant has a significant family  life  with  her
         grandmother and indeed with the other children (her  cousins)  whom
         she resides with.  A breach would most certainly occur  in  all  of
         their family lives if the appellant were removed from  that  family
         set-up.   The  appellant's  mother  has  been  travelling  back  to
         Thailand on a yearly basis to see the appellant and I  do  not  see
         any reason why she cannot continue to do this.   I  find  that  the
         decision is proportionate in the interests of maintaining effective
         immigration control."

9.   Having emphasised that he had considered all the evidence in the  round
    he found that the circumstances at the date of the decision  were  that
    the responsibility for the appellant was shared between the appellant's
    mother  and  grandmother  and  that  the  relevant  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules had not been met.

10.  He therefore dismissed the appeal on both  immigration  and  Article  8
    grounds.

11.  The grounds of appeal on which Mr  Stone  relied  emphasised  that  the
    judge had found the appellant's mother and her husband to be  witnesses
    of truth and that he had  accepted that money was being  sent  for  the
    appellant's  upkeep.   The  grounds  then  argue   that   the   judge's
    conclusions regarding the Article 8 rights of the appellant had ignored
    the appellant's best interests: they  referring to the determination in
    LD (Article 8 - best interests  of  child)  Zimbabwe  [2010]  UKUT  278
    (IAC).  In that determination it had been emphasised that the interests
    of minor children were a primary consideration.  Having emphasised that
    the appellant was an 8 year old girl who wished to live with her mother
    it was argued that it was difficult for the judge to have  reached  the
    conclusion that she should continue to live with  her  grandmother  and
    six other children.

12.  It was argued that the judge had not properly set  out  the  structured
    approach set out in Razgar and that he had not followed  the  direction
    of Moses LJ in the Fawad Ahmadi v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 1721 which  were
    that the obligation under Article 8 was not to inhibit  development  of
    real family life in the future.  It was argued that  there  was  family
    life between the appellant and her mother even if they  had  not  lived
    together.

13.  With regard to the issue of sole responsibility it was argued that  the
    judge had misunderstood the law and in  fact  had  missed  the  central
    guidance in TD which was that the test was not whether anyone else  had
    day-to-day responsibility or whether the parents had continuing control
    and direction of  the  child's  upbringing  including  making  all  the
    important decisions in the child's life.  It was pointed out  that  the
    judge had found that the appellant's grandmother would  accede  to  the
    appellant's  mother's  wishes  and  that  that   indicated   that   the
    appellant's mother was in charge.  It was argued  that  the  judge  had
    missed the central point of "control and direction".

14.  Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Landes granted  permission  to  appeal
    stating that the grounds relating  to  Article  8  were  arguable.  She
    referred to the approach set out in Mundeba [2013] UKUT 88.

15.  Judge Landes went on to  say  that  she  considered  that  the  grounds
    relating to sole responsibility were weaker.  She noted that the  judge
    had made no findings about the position of the appellant's  father  but
    in any event he had not completely  disappeared  from  the  appellant's
    life.

16.  A Rule 24 statement was served on 27 June 2011 in which the  respondent
    stated that the grounds advanced showed no material arguable errors  of
    law.  The judge had properly considered paragraph 297 of HC 395 and the
    determination in TD and had made reasonable and sustainable findings of
    fact which were open to him when he found that parental  responsibility
    was  shared  between  the  appellant's  mother  in  Britain   and   the
    appellant's grandmother.  The respondent submitted that Section  55  of
    the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act did not apply to  children
    outside Britain but in any event the decision had been proportionate.

17.  At the hearing of the appeal Mr Stone relied on the grounds  of  appeal
    but stated that he had not raised the issue of Section  55  of  the  UK
    Borders Act in the grounds of appeal as he accepted  that  it  did  not
    apply to an appellant who was  outside  Britain.   What  he  wished  to
    emphasise, however, was that a  central  issue  was  the  child's  best
    interests.  That was something which the judge had not  considered  and
    it was surely in the appellant's best interests to be with her  mother;
    her interests were a primary consideration.

18.  He went on to refer to the various steps in  Razgar  stating  that  had
    the judge followed those steps  then  the  impact  on  the  appellant's
    future family life would have been taken  into  account  and  that  the
    decision would have been found to be disproportionate.

19.  With regard to the conclusions regarding sole responsibility he  stated
    that the judge had erred in the way in which he dealt with the law.  He
    emphasised that the judge had  accepted  that  in  most  instances  the
    grandmother would accede to the decisions of  the  appellant's  mother.
    He argued that the issue of sole responsibility was not a matter  which
    concerned day-to-day care and control.  He asked me therefore  to  find
    that there were material errors of law in the determination.

20.  In reply Mr Jarvis asked me to find that there was  no  material  error
    of law in the determination.  The judge had properly addressed  himself
    on the law and on the evidence and had dealt properly with the issue of
    the appellant's rights under Article 8.

Discussion

21.   I  find  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  determination  of  the
    Immigration Judge.  This is a determination in which the judge set  out
    the relevant facts and reached a conclusion in paragraph  20  that  the
    decision was proportionate.  He correctly pointed out  that  Article  8
    had not been relied on in the grounds  of  appeal  or  before  him  and
    therefore of course there were no detailed arguments on  which  he  was
    required to comment.  Nevertheless, having considered the facts of this
    case the conclusion he came to was clearly open to him.  The reality is
    that this appellant had always lived with her  grandmother  and  indeed
    her cousins since she was born.  She lived  in  materially  comfortable
    circumstances within the context of life in Thailand and was well cared
    for.  The judge, as Mr Stone accepted and indeed did not argue, was not
    required to take into  account  Section  55  of  the  UK  Borders  Act.
    Although, he was required to weigh up relevant factors and to  consider
    the interests of the child as a primary consideration.  On  the factual
    matrix which was before him it cannot be said that his decision ignored
    the interests of the appellant.   While  he  could  have  set  out  his
    conclusions in greater detail I consider that his conclusion, that  the
    decision was proportionate, was entirely open to him and that the  fact
    that he did not state  that  he  considered  that  the  rights  of  the
    appellant were a primary consideration is not relevant.

22.   Moreover,  the  fact  that  he  clearly   considered  the   issue   of
    proportionality makes it evident that there would have been no point in
    him going through the various steps as set out in the judgment  of  the
    House of Lords in Razgar.  It would, of course, have been open  to  him
    to have stated that he did  not  accept  that  there  was  family  life
    between the appellant and her mother but he did not do so.

23.  I consider that his conclusions were fully open to him and he  made  no
    error of law in finding that the decision was a proportionate one.

24.  With regard  to  the  appellant's  rights  under  the  Rules  he  again
    considered all the relevant evidence and applied appropriate case  law.
    His  conclusion  that  the  appellant's  mother  did  not   have   sole
    responsibility was entirely open to him.   He  was  entitled  to  place
    weight on the very short period of months that the  appellant's  mother
    had spent with her and although, as Judge Landes pointed out, the judge
    did not comment on the role which the appellant's father played in  her
    upbringing that clearly  was  also  a  consideration  that  would  have
    fortified his conclusion that the decision was proportionate.

25.  I therefore find that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the judge and  I  therefore  find  that  his  decision
    dismissing this appeal on both immigration  and  human  rights  grounds
    shall stand.
