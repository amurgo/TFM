For the Appellant:     MR S WALKER (HOME OFFICE PRESENTING OFFICER)
For the Respondent:    MR EVANS - IN PERSON


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  determination
      on the papers by First Tier Tribunal Judge Britton  (FTJ)  promulgated
      on 3.6.2013.  The FTJ allowed the appeal to vary leave to remain to Mr
      Evans under the Tier 1 (General) points based scheme. The matter comes
      before  us  to  consider  if  there  was  an  error  of  law  in   the
      determination.


   Background
   2.   The appellant refused Mr Evans 'application on the  grounds  of  his
      failure  to  show  previous  earnings  (Appendix  B)  and  maintenance
      (Appendix C). Mr Evans submitted details  of  his  earnings  including
      dividend vouchers in the sums  of  �10,000  and  �9,000.  He  produced
      evidence of the dividend income in bank  statements.   The  respondent
      was not satisfied that the  amounts  shown  accurately  reflected  the
      stated income and consequently awarded only 15 points.


   3. The appellant then considered maintenance  in  respect  of  which  the
      respondent had provided copies of his internet  bank  statements.  The
      appellant awarded  0  points  for  the  failure  to  produce  original
      documentary evidence.  The refusal letter dated 19.2.2013  stated  "As
      the application falls for refusal on other grounds your original  bank
      statements were not requested".


   First Tier determination
   4.  The Judge considered the appeal on the papers and took  into  account
      evidence of letters dated 1st and 5th March 2013 from  Mr  Evans   and
      certified bank statements produced by him under a cover  letter  dated
      15th May 2013 sent to the Secretary of State.  The  Judge  found  that
      the appellant failed to properly examine the bank statements and as  a
      result miscalculated the dividend  income  by  failing  to  take  into
      account an overpayment of �1500 shown in  the  statements.  The  Judge
      concluded  that  the  appellant  was  in  a  position  to   meet   the
      requirements of the immigration rules as the evidence showed that  the
      dividend income was corroborated in the statements.  He relied on  the
      original bank statements sent post decision as  evidence  meeting  the
      maintenance requirements and allowed the appeal.

     Grounds of appeal
   5.  The Secretary of State submitted that the FTJ  erred  by  relying  on
      post decision evidence as to maintenance.  He took into account at the
      date of the hearing documentary evidence of certified bank  statements
      which had not been submitted with the application, contrary to section
      85A(3) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   Permission  was
      granted by First Tier Tribunal Judge Fisher on 18.6.2013.


      Initial hearing before us
   6.  Mr Walker did not pursue the grounds of appeal. He accepted that  had
      the Secretary of State not miscalculated the dividend income as  shown
      in bank statements, Mr Evans would have achieved the  relevant  number
      of points for his previous earnings.  As  the  maintenance  issue  was
      secondary to the refusal, the Secretary of State had not asked for the
      originals or given any opportunity to Mr Evans to produce the original
      bank statements, in accordance with  the  UKBA  policy  guidance.   Mr
      Evans subsequently produced the certified bank statements  which  were
      before the FTJ.


   7. We conclude that the Judge should have allowed the appeal as not being
      in accordance with the law, since the Secretary of State did not apply
      her own  policy  of  contacting  the  appellant  to  request  original
      documents. However, as the Secretary of State has  accepted  that  the
      appeal will be allowed, there can only be  one  outcome.   Accordingly
      the original decision should stand.


   8. Decision
      There is no material error of law in the determination.
      The decision of the First Tier Tribunal shall stand.
