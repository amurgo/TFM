Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr M Allison, counsel instructed by RAMFEL
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellants, who  I  shall  refer  to  as  A1,  A2  and  A3,  sought
    permission to appeal the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pacey
    dated 8 January 2018.  Permission to appeal was given in June 2018  and
    by a decision promulgated on 28 November  2018  I  concluded  that  the
    Original Tribunal's decision could not stand and the matter  should  be
    listed for a resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

2.   The resumed hearing took  place  on  21  January  2019.   As  has  been
    recognised, the outcome of the appeal turned on the consideration of A3
    who is now 17� years old, having been born in Mauritius as were A1  and
    A2.  He entered the UK on 9 November 2006 aged 5 years 4 months and has
    resided in the UK for  over  twelve  years.   The  Judge's  failure  to
    properly address Section 117B(6)  of  the  NIAA  2002  as  amended  was
    problematic because the Judge had simply whilst referring  to  some  of
    the matters had  failed  to  assess  the  reasonableness  of  A3  being
    required to leave the United Kingdom; when he was  a  qualifying  child
    and its impact upon his parents, A1 and A2.  The matter  has  since  it
    was considered moved on in that there was now to hand the  decision  in
    KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53  which  specifically  deals  with   the
    relationship between a qualifying child and the parents.  In the speech
    of Lord Carnwath in KO the view has been taken that the conduct of  the
    parents and their immigration history  is  not  determinative  of  what
    happened to the qualifying child which  had  to  be  set  in  the  real
    context where the parents had no any right to remain in the UK.

3.   It therefore was  the  case  that  a  person  who  was  not  liable  to
    deportation then the public interest does  not  require  that  person's
    removal where  that  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child and it would not be reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the UK.

4.   KO lists by reference  to  the  guidance  that  was  published  by  the
    Secretary of State factors which will be considered.  Those factors are
    to an extent recited in guidance given to caseworkers which at the date
    of the decision in this case  had  not  been  changed  to  reflect  the
    Secretary of State's view published on 19 December 2018 on family  life
    in the Family Migrations: Appendix FM Section 1.0b.  Mr Tufan  referred
    to the current guidance but it seemed to me the  current  guidance  did
    not demonstrate an error of law by the Judge who  was  unaware  of  it.
    The relevant guidance was published in  August  2015.   Parts  of  that
    guidance are also cited in the Upper Tribunal decision in PD and Others
    (Article 8 - conjoined family claims) Sri Lanka [2016] UKUT 00108.

5.   It was argued by Mr Allison that quite  simply  for  A3  to  return  to
    Mauritius with his parents was simply  not  reasonable.   A  number  of
    factors were relied upon in no particular order and originally advanced
    in the skeleton argument that was put before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  In particular, the best interests of A3 lie in remaining in the
    United Kingdom; secondly, the length of  time  he  has  been  here  and
    undertaken in effect the majority of his schooling;  thirdly,  that  he
    has completed a BTEC level 2 diploma in media studies and would wish to
    continue the studies by way of a practical engineering course, which he
    could start in September 2019.   Fourthly,  A3  has  had  an  extensive
    private life in the United Kingdom and part of that  private  life  has
    been the part his sister, [GB], has played in his life. Just as much as
    he has played in hers, particularly in relation to  recent  unfortunate
    events in connection with a child born to her which subsequently  died.
    [GB] has some limited leave to remain in the  UK  but  was  seeking  to
    establish leave stay in the United Kingdom with a view to moving on  to
    permanence in residence here.  The point was pressed also as  a  factor
    that the interference would have  an  impact  through  removal  on  the
    Appellant on his sister.

6.   It is not entirely clear to me on what basis [GB] originally  succeeded
    in establishing a limited right to be in the  United  Kingdom  but  the
    fact was, as before the Judge, she was the only  one  allowed  to  have
    paid work which supported her family.  She  was  undoubtedly  dependent
    upon her parents  in  terms  of  emotional  support  but  she  was  the
    financial provider for them all, earning net c. �300 a week  after  tax
    and national insurance deductions.  Finally, it was said for A3 he  has
    no ability to speak, count or operate in Creole, the lingua  franca  of
    Mauritius, and  he  would  therefore  face  significant  impediment  in
    establishing a  career  in  business  there,  as  he  moved  closer  to
    adulthood.

7.   All those points are as a fact well made but as Mr  Allison  acceptedA1
    and A2s' claims to remain are entirely driven  by  A3's  succeeding  in
    demonstrating it is not reasonable for him to return to Mauritius.

8.   In support of the appeal there were originally statements  made  by  A1
    and  A2  and  nothing  is  said  to  effectively  suggest  that   those
    considerations, which were taken  into  account  should  not  be  given
    weight. The  reality  was  A1  and  A2  came  as  visitors  and  simply
    overstayed, they had no expectation of remaining and even if they  came
    under some misunderstanding, as to the possibilities of  applying  once
    here to remain, the  underlying  objective  of  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom was for economic betterment and for a better life and education
    for their children.  Since being here they have also been a cost to the
    NHS and the liabilities were originally put at �7,000 for A2 and  about
    �3,000 for A1.  Those sums are now being paid off at a rate of �10  per
    week out of [GB]'s earnings.

9.   The accommodation where the Appellants live  is  provided  by  a  local
    council and the rent and, it seemed, such council tax was  to  be  paid
    for by the local authority: Albeit the local authority maybe looking to
    [GB] to contribute towards at least her element of  occupation  of  the
    house.

10.  The Judge did not substantively criticise A3 immigration  history.  The
    immigration decisions made by A1 and A2 were entirely their choice  and
    done in the clear knowledge that they had no basis to remain, nor  have
    they had their visit visas had expired.

11.  The Judge below accepted, and it seemed to me no-one has argued to  the
    contrary, that the best interests of A3 lie in  remaining  in  the  UK.
    The Judge took into account  the  various  factors  that  were  pressed
    before him but the effect of the Judge's decision being overturned  was
    that it has enabled A3 to complete at least the stage of his education.
    He would wish to carry on his studies and has the ability to do so.

12.  In addition, it was  clear  that  A1  and  A2  would  wish  to  support
    themselves and for A1 to work.  They embarked  upon  and  received  NHS
    treatment and have educated their children at the public expense.  They
    undoubtedly delayed making their applications in order  to  obtain  the
    benefits that they could in the United Kingdom.  Whether  or  not  they
    now accept it, their conduct once they were in  the  UK  was  aimed  at
    seeking to settle in the United Kingdom. The Judge originally concluded
    that that had been their intentions from the outset.

13.  The issue, I did not hear any argument to the contrary  that  the  best
    interests of A3 lie in staying in the United Kingdom,  was  whether  or
    not it was reasonable for him to leave the United  Kingdom  and  return
    with his family to Mauritius.

14.  In considering that matter I have weighed up the pros and cons  of  his
    circumstances and the impact upon him of having to remove,  bearing  in
    mind the length of time which he has been in  the  United  Kingdom.   I
    consider the period of time in the United Kingdom started at about  the
    age of 5 and probably for the earlier years he was more focused on  his
    family and his parents. However he  has  obviously  been  developing  a
    private life in the United Kingdom, made friends and acquaintances  and
    had a life here. The twelve years he has been in the  UK  have  brought
    him to an important point in his further education.

15.  I take into account that it was his parents' choice not to educate  him
    in Creole and not to introduce him to the culture and ways of  life  in
    Mauritius.  As A3 identified in his statement he plainly felt  that  he
    was British.  He did not wish to leave the United Kingdom  and  yet  he
    felt his life  has  been  put  on  hold  through  the  effects  of  the
    Respondent's decisions so that he cannot, as  his  friends  have  done,
    move forward, work, travel abroad on holiday, learn to drive and  other
    things which he would otherwise have wished to do.   He  unsurprisingly
    wished to remain with his parents in the United Kingdom and he  has  no
    interest in returning to Mauritius.

16.  As the case law indicated there need to be good  and  powerful  reasons
    why if someone  has  the  benefit  of  the  rights  acknowledged  as  a
    qualifying child to remain in the United Kingdom, he should not do  so.
    The case of KO highlights the fact that Section 117B (6)  of  the  NIAA
    applies where, even though the parents have no rights to  remain,  then
    it the question remains whether or not It was reasonable that the child
    leaves the UK. The fact that a child would  leave  the  United  Kingdom
    with their parents because they had no right to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom does not avoid the question of the reasonableness.   Therefore,
    acknowledging as Lord Carnwath did in his speech, the rationale of  and
    relationship between Section 55 BCIA 2009 and EV  (Philippines)  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 874, the parents having no right  to  remain  was  indeed  the
    background against which the assessment came to be conducted.

17.  I concluded looking at this matter as I must do  in  the  "real  world"
    that it was not reasonable  for  the  Appellant  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom because of his age, the length of time he has been  in  the  UK
    with its attendant consequences and the important stage he has  arrived
    at in his education.  There would be clear and real difficulties in his
    reintegration into life in Mauritius.  I have taken into  account  that
    his sister may remain in the UK but that position was uncertain  and  I
    do not give that factor significant weight.

18.  Whilst A1 said  that  he  was  a  carpenter  by  trade,  the  world  of
    carpentry and the availability of work in  Mauritius  has  changed,  it
    seemed to me that that may as a fact be right but that was not  to  say
    the evidence showed that he simply could not find any work or that  the
    Appellants would be forced into destitution and serious hardship.

19.  I find the best interests of A3 alone would lie  in  remaining  in  the
    United Kingdom.  I take into account the case of Treebhawon and  Others
    (NIAA 2002 Part 5A - compelling  circumstances  test)  [2017]  UKUT  13
    which has to a degree moved on with the development of KO  but  in  the
    fact-finding exercise and carrying out the evaluation of  it,  most  of
    the matters relied upon are uncontentious. However, I am  only  looking
    at the reasonableness of A3 returning to Mauritius. I have  taken  into
    account JG (s117(B): "reasonable  to  leave"  UK)  Turkey  [2019]  UKUT
    00072. I find Article 8 private/family life rights are engaged.

20.  I find the Respondent decisions  are  lawful  and  serve  Article  8(2)
    purposes in the maintenance of immigration controls.  I  conclude  that
    although the A3 could have a life in  Mauritius  with  difficulties  in
    transition on return to Mauritius it was not reasonable to  expect  him
    to leave. It followed that for A1  and  A2,  who  have  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with A3 from that the public  interest
    did not require A1 and A2's removal.  At the present  time  I  did  not
    find, for the above reasons, that  the  return  of  the  Appellants  to
    Mauritius was proportionate. It will be a matter for the Respondent  to
    decide what period of leave should be given in the context of  the  age
    of A3, his education and his elder sibling's status in the UK.
