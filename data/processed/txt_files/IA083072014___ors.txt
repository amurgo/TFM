Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Claimants:     Ms M Malhotra (Counsel instructed by Chipatiso
Associates LLP)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   For ease of reference I shall refer to the parties  as  the  "Secretary
    of State" who is the Appellant and to the "Claimants".

2.   This is an appeal against a Decision  and  Reasons  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Wellesley-Cole) promulgated on 24 October 2014 in which
    the Tribunal allowed  the  appeals  against  a  decision  made  by  the
    Secretary  of  State  on  29  January  2014  to  remove  the  Claimants
    administratively on the grounds  that  their  human  rights  claim  was
    refused.

3.   The Claimants are all members of the same family and  are  citizens  of
    Sri Lanka.  The first claimant is Mr M U whose  date  of  birth  is  11
    December 1978, his dependent wife is Mrs F M whose date of birth  is  9
    November 1988 is the second and main Claimant and the third Claimant is
    their 2ï¿½ year old daughter whose date of birth is 5 May 2012.

Background

4.   The Secretary of State took into account that the Claimant entered  the
    UK on 8 October 2010 as a student on a visa  valid  until  29  February
    2012.  His application for leave to remain on human rights grounds  was
    refused without a right of appeal on 6 April 2013.  Notice of liability
    to removal was served on the parties  on  11  November  2013.   Further
    representations were received on 22 January  2014  on  the  grounds  of
    family and private life.

5.   The main application was made by F M with  her  husband  and  child  as
    dependants.  She claimed to have met her partner, a fellow  Sri  Lankan
    national in 2010.  He entered the UK in 1999 initially as a student and
    subsequently remained with leave as a work permit holder although  this
    was  revoked  in  2007.   He  thereafter  remained  in  the  UK  as  an
    overstayer.  An application for leave to remain outside  of  the  Rules
    was submitted by him on 15 August 2011 and refused on 27 October  2011.



6.   The Secretary of State considered Article 8 of the ECHR under  Appendix
    FM and 276ADE of the Immigration  Rules.   It  was  accepted  that  the
    Claimant met the  suitability  requirements  but  failed  to  meet  the
    eligibility  requirements  as  either  a  partner  or  a  parent.    In
    accordance with paragraph 276ADE the Claimant was not able to meet  the
    requirements therein.  Consideration was given to the needs and welfare
    of  the  child  under  Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009.  The Claimant's return to Sri Lanka with  members
    of her family would not breach Article 8 and such private life  as  was
    established could equally be maintained from abroad in Sri Lanka.

7.    The Tribunal heard oral evidence from the Claimant  and  her  husband.
    The Tribunal had regard to the freestanding Article 8  outside  of  the
    Rules.  It considered that private life encompassed  family life.   The
    Tribunal  accepted that there was a family life established  but  found
    no interference as the family would be removed as a unit.  The Tribunal
    cited  the  guidance  of  Lord  Bingham  in  Razgar  and   focused   on
    proportionality having regard to Huang Court  of  Appeal,   AG  Eritrea
    [2007] EWCA Civ 801,  VW Uganda [2009] EWCA Civ 5 and EB Kosovo  [2008]
    UKHL 41.  The Tribunal considered length of residence in the  UK,  age,
    contribution to society, the fact the parties were  economically  self-
    sufficient and their 2 year old child was born in the UK as factors  in
    favour of the individuals' private  interests.   The  Tribunal  further
    considered part 5A of the  Immigration  Act  2014  which  brought  into
    effect Section 117 setting out those public interest factors  that  the
    Tribunal must have regard to in reaching a  decision  under  Article  8
    ECHR.

Grounds of Application

Ground 1

8.   The Secretary of State submitted that the Tribunal failed to  give  any
    or any adequate reasons why it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the
    Claimants to  return  to  their  home  country.   Although  reaching  a
    decision that the removal would be disproportionate the Tribunal failed
    to articulate those reasons in support of the decision. (Paragraphs  12
    and 14 were inadequate).  The Tribunal failed to state  any  compelling
    or exceptional circumstances to warrant consideration  outside  of  the
    Rules.

Ground 2

9.   The Tribunal erred in including family life as part of  the  assessment
    for private life, in the circumstances that the family would be removed
    as a unit and as such there would be no interference with their  family
    life.

Permission

10.   Permission  was  granted  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    McCarthy on 17 November 2014, as follows:

         "Although at 11 and 12 the  judge  identified  the  correct  legal
         principles that she had to apply, namely she  had  to  undertake  a
         proportionality exercise, and although at  12  she  identified  the
         statutory provisions relating to public interest considerations, at
         no point does  she  carry  out  the  necessary  balancing  exercise
         between the personal circumstances of the appellants and the public
         interest.  In other words, it is eminently arguable that no reasons
         have been given for the judge's findings at 14."

The Hearing

11.  This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in the decision  and  reasons  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

12.  I heard oral submissions from Ms Holmes and from Ms  Malhotra  which  I
    have taken into account together with written submissions  in  reaching
    my decision.

13.  Ms Holmes  relied  on  the  grounds  and  amplified  the  same  in  her
    submissions.  The Tribunal failed to give any reasons at  all  for  the
    proportionality decision and had not considered  the  circumstances  on
    return to Sri Lanka either.  This  was  simply  not  adequate  and  the
    Tribunal  failed  to  grapple  with  the  circumstances  of  the   case
    sufficiently.  There was no consideration of compelling or  exceptional
    circumstances to justify consideration of the  application  outside  of
    the Rules. A further error was  the  focus  on  private  life  and  the
    failure to address family life, which was a material error, given  that
    the family would be removed as a unit and there would be no  breach  of
    Article 8 family life.


14.  Ms Malhotra submitted that the Tribunal had regard  to  the  length  of
    time in the UK spent by the Claimant's husband (fifteen years) and  the
    fact that he had worked, paid taxes and never been an  economic  burden
    on the State.  The  Tribunal  looked  at  the  circumstances  from  the
    perspective of Section 117B.  She acknowledged that it was unclear what
    the Tribunal meant at paragraph 11, "although they applied  on  private
    life grounds as opposed to family life, I have subsumed the family life
    arguments into the private life grounds assessment because they  are  a
    family and have lived here."

15.  Ms Malhotra relied on written submissions.  She  accepted  that  whilst
    reference is made to the fact that an application was made only on  the
    basis of private life, the application must have been made on the basis
    of family and private life and  accordingly  she  conceded  that  there
    ought to have been some consideration of family life in the decision.

16.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision which I now give  with
    my reasons.

Discussion and Decision

17.  I  am  satisfied  that  there  were  material  errors  of  law  in  the
    determination which shall be set aside. I am satisfied that the grounds
    have been made out.

18.  In short, although the Decision and Reasons referred to relevant  legal
    principles, thereafter it failed to apply the same to findings of  fact
    and failed to give adequate reasons for reaching its decision.

19.  The Claimants did not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    either under Appendix FM or having regard to paragraph  276ADE.   I  am
    satisfied that the Tribunal embarked on a freestanding assessment under
    Article 8 ECHR without reference  to  the  existence  of  circumstances
    outside of the Rules to justify the same. On the facts  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances ( and none have been relied  on)  to  support
    consideration under Article 8  outside of the Rules.

20.   Furthermore I find that the Tribunal failed  to  properly  follow  the
    step-by-step approach propounded by Lord Bingham in  Razgar.   Somewhat
    oddly it focused only on the private life of the Claimants, and  in  so
    doing purported also to consider family life.  This was a  clear  error
    of law that was material to the outcome of the decision.   In  addition
    to which there was no consideration of the circumstances for the family
    either as a unit or separately of their situation in Sri Lanka in terms
    of existing family, social and cultural ties  and  the  possibility  of
    employment etc. I am satisfied that  the  Tribunal's  consideration  of
    Article 8 issues was entirely flawed.

21.   I now propose to re-make that decision  without  further  hearing  and
    having regard to the evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal.

22.  There was no dispute as to the facts in  the  matter.   The  Claimant's
    husband entered the UK in 1999 and had leave to remain until 2011.  The
    parties met whilst studying in the UK in December 2010.    The  husband
    was engaged in employment and was economically  self-sufficient  during
    the time he was  employed.   Prior  to  that  he  obtained  educational
    qualifications in Computer Science.  His leave as a work permit  holder
    was curtailed.  The main Claimant resided in the UK for three years and
    their child was born in April 2012.

23.  The Claimants are essentially a young hard working family who  wish  to
    settle and remain in the UK. For Mr M U there has been  a  considerable
    period of residence in the UK of some fifteen years which was  entirely
    lawful until 2011 when his leave was curtailed.  None of the  Claimants
    have been able to meet the requirements of the Rules having  regard  to
    private or family life.  I find no basis for considering Article 8 ECHR
    as there are simply  no  exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances  to
    justify considering the claim outside of the Rules.

24.  If I am wrong and it were necessary to follow the  step-by-step  Razgar
    approach then I find no arguable basis for reaching any conclusion that
    the decision to remove the family to  Sri  Lanka  is  disproportionate.
    The Claimants are a family unit. The child is only 2ï¿½ years of age  and
    therefore her interests clearly lie  in  remaining  with  both  of  her
    parents wherever that may be.  She is far too young to have established
    any independent life in the UK.  The parents both came  to  the  UK  as
    students and as such their immigration status was temporary.   Although
    Mr M U was given work permit status again this was limited for a number
    of years and in any  event  was  curtailed.   Having  regard  to  their
    respective private lives, there is simply no  evidence  to  support  an
    argument that there was any interference with the private lives.  It is
    clear that the main claimant has been living in the UK for a relatively
    short time and maintained links with family members in Sri Lanka  where
    her parents are living.   Whilst  there  was  no  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal as to the circumstances of family, social or economic ties  in
    Sri Lanka, there certainly was no evidence to show  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the family to return to Sri Lanka.

25.  For all of the above reasons the appeal  is  dismissed  on  immigration
    and human rights grounds.


Decision

26.  I find a material error of law in the Tribunal's decision.

27.  The decision is set aside.

28.  I re-make the decision and substitute a decision  that  the  appeal  is
    dismissed on immigration and human rights grounds.
