For the Respondent:    Mr Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Albania.  Her dependent is her infant
       daughter born in the UK. She has permission to  appeal  against  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Irvine)  to  dismiss  her
       appeal against a decision to remove her from the UK.  That  decision
       followed a rejection of  her  claims  for  international  protection
       under the Refugee Convention and the European  Convention  on  Human
       Rights.








       Background and Matters in Issue

    2. The basis of the Appellant's claim was that she had been  trafficked
       into prostitution in Italy but had managed to escape  the  gang  who
       held her, which was headed by her then husband. She  fears  that  if
       returned to Albania today she will be identified  and  re-trafficked
       or otherwise punished for having escaped.  Alternatively  she  fears
       that  she  will  be  re-trafficked  by  others  or  otherwise   face
       discrimination amounting to persecution by Albanian society who will
       perceive her, a single mother with a young child, as having  been  a
       prostitute.


    3. Her claim was refused on the 1st November 2012. The  Respondent  did
       not believe the Appellant's account of  having  been  trafficked  to
       Italy. She had given inconsistent evidence at the  asylum  interview
       about when she went to Italy and  how  long  she  spent  there.  The
       Respondent doubted that her husband would prostitute her.  She  had,
       in the Respondent's view been unable to furnish the account with any
       significant consistent or coherent detail. It was  unclear  why  she
       had not managed to escape earlier. Her claim that she had managed to
       return to Albania after spending E20 on a taxi to take her  to  Bari
       was rejected since the distance to Bari from Rome, where she claimed
       she was held, is over 500km. The Respondent also found contradiction
       in the Appellant's evidence that when  she  was  in  Italy  she  had
       managed to speak on two occasions to her father but had not told him
       about what was happening to her. In the alternative  the  Respondent
       considered that there would be no risk of the  Appellant  being  re-
       trafficked from Albania and that there would  be  a  sufficiency  of
       protection there for her.  The asylum claim was rejected and on  the
       6th November 2012 the Respondent decided  to  remove  the  Appellant
       from the UK.

    4.  The  matter  came  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal   and   in   a
       determination dated the 2nd January 2013 Judge Irvine dismissed  the
       Appellant's appeal.

    5. Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  Judge
       Chalkley on the 22nd February 2013.  In a response under rule  24[1]
       Ms Marsh, Senior Caseworker at the Home Office,  conceded  that  the
       determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  could  not  stand.  The
       Respondent accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to  make
       findings about the central  matters  in  issue  and  had  based  its
       findings  on  credibility  on  peripheral  matters.  The  Respondent
       invited the Upper Tribunal to  list  the  appeal  for  a  full  oral
       "continuance hearing".

    6. So it was that the appeal came before me. At  the  hearing  I  heard
       oral evidence of the Appellant and submissions by Mr Bonavero and Mr
       Saunders. I was provided with complete  paginated  bundles  by  both
       parties. I have considered all of the evidence before me,  including
       that which is not specifically mentioned below.



       The Re-Made Decision


       The Appellant's Evidence

    7. The Appellant has given her account of what has happened to  her  in
       the past over the course of two interviews,  two  tribunal  hearings
       and in a detailed witness statement. The burden lies on her to  show
       that the account given is reasonably likely to be true.


    8. The core of her claim is as follows.  She  was  born  in  Kukes,  in
       Northern Albania. She has received a primary  level  education.  Her
       father was a strict "fanatical"[2] Muslim and, in  common  with  the
       rest  of  society  from  that  area,   followed   the   kanun.    In
       approximately 1992 the Appellant's father fell into a  land  dispute
       with a neighbouring family. This resulted in various court cases  in
       the years which followed. The  Appellant  has  produced  some  court
       documents in respect of this land dispute. In 2009  the  Appellant's
       father suggested giving her in  marriage  to  one  of  the  opposing
       family in order to end the dispute. The other family agreed to  this
       solution.  The  Appellant  married  GS  in  September  2009   in   a
       traditional ceremony attended  by  their  respective  families.  The
       Appellant went to stay with GS for a short period before  travelling
       to Italy with him.  GS provided her with a  false  Italian  passport
       for this journey which the Appellant used because she had  to  "obey
       his rules"[3].

    9. Once in Italy the Appellant was kept in a house with GS and a number
       of other people including two of his cousins. He told her that Italy
       was expensive and she would have to work for him if she was going to
       stay there. When the Appellant resisted GS raped and beat  her.  The
       Appellant was not permitted to leave the house or have  any  contact
       with anyone outside of it.  She was told that if she tried to  leave
       she would be arrested because she was  in  Italy  illegally[4].  Men
       were brought to the house - up to ten a day - to have sex with  her.
       The money was paid  to  GS.  On  two  occasions  the  Appellant  was
       permitted to speak with her father. When she intimated that she  was
       having problems he told her to obey GS's rules because she  was  his
       wife now.

   10. After she had been there for some months GS's  cousins  returned  to
       the house one day and said that GS had been  picked  up  by  Italian
       police. They were  collecting  their  belongings  and  leaving.  The
       Appellant took her chance by taking some money that GS  had  in  the
       flat and getting  a cab to Bari where  she  took  a  ferry  home  to
       Albania.

   11. Once she was back in Albania the Appellant returned  to  Kukes.  She
       told her family what had happened in Italy but they "did not  accept
       her"[5]. They said that she had to go back to her husband's  family.
       The Appellant left her family home but did not go  to  her  in-laws.
       Instead she went to stay with a friend in La Prake. After some  time
       the Appellant got her own accommodation and  started  working  as  a
       hairdresser.  Asked why she had not sought the help of the  Albanian
       authorities at this point the Appellant said that "[GS] has lots  of
       his  close  people  to  the  authority   and   I   couldn't   report
       anything"[6].

   12. In June 2011 the Appellant's friend introduced her to a man named PL
       who had recently returned to Albania from Greece where he  had  been
       working. They started a relationship and the Appellant went to  live
       with him and his family in  Paskugan.  In  November  2011  she  fell
       pregnant. They  were  married  in  April  2012.  The  Appellant  has
       produced a copy of her marriage certificate and photographs  of  the
       wedding.

   13. In July 2012 the Appellant was out shopping when she  met  GS  in  a
       busy market street. He started threatening her. He said that she had
       "made a mistake" registering her marriage with PL because  this  was
       how he had found  her.  The  Appellant  believes  that  this  was  a
       reference to the contacts  that  GS  has  in  local  authorities  in
       Albania. She states that he has various relatives  in  positions  of
       authority. As an example she has  produced  a  copy  of  her  "birth
       certificate", in fact a registration  document  issued  in  November
       2008 in respect of her identity.  It is signed by a 'DS' an official
       who shares the same surname as GS. The Appellant states that this is
       his cousin.  He said that if she didn't come back to  him  he  would
       kill her and her brothers. In her oral evidence  the  Appellant  was
       asked whether anything had  happened  to  her  brothers  since  this
       incident.  In my record of proceedings I have noted that in response
       to this question the Appellant was "emotional -  choking  -  tears".
       She said that she did not know, that she had  no  contact  with  her
       brothers and that she did not want to speak to them.

   14. The Appellant went and reported this incident to the  Vice  Head  of
       the local Commune who made a note of what she  had  to  say  -  this
       official said that he would report it on her behalf.  The  Appellant
       decided that she had to tell PL. She went home and  explained  about
       the threats from GS and who he was.  PL  was  very  upset  that  the
       Appellant had not told him about  her  experiences  before.  He  was
       crying and they were arguing.  He felt that he could  not  carry  on
       with the relationship. The Appellant believes that  his  family  put
       pressure on him to end it with her - his brother told  him  that  he
       could not be involved with a prostitute. In her  oral  evidence  she
       said that he "did not have a lot of options" once he knew about  her
       past, and that his family were very conservative.

   15. The Appellant was afraid to remain in Albania now that she had  been
       located by GS. He had a lot of family in Albania,  including  people
       in positions of influence such as an uncle working in  a  town  hall
       and an aunt who is a Judge in Tirana[7].

   16. PL agreed to help the Appellant. She was carrying his  child  so  he
       did it for the child's sake. He organised the Appellant's  departure
       from Albania concealed in a lorry. She left within  days  of  having
       met GS in the market.

   17. In addition to the Appellant's own evidence I was provided with some
       medical evidence. This consisted of medical records released by  the
       Appellant's GP which indicated that she was prescribed paroxetine[8]
       after  reporting  low  mood,  difficulty  in   sleeping   and   poor
       concentration. She expressed fears about being pursued  and  general
       anxiety. In a letter dated 11th June 2013  Dr  Mylvaganam  confirmed
       that the Appellant had been diagnosed with depression. She  is  also
       suffering from urinary incontinence "which may  be  related  to  her
       traumatic past" and chest pain.


       My Findings of Fact

   18. I found the Appellant's evidence to be consistent at its core. There
       were discrepancies but I did not find these to be overly concerning.
       For instance the Appellant had initially said that she left Italy in
       December 2010[9] but subsequently said that it would have  been  May
       2011[10].  Similarly the Appellant appears unsure about how long she
       spent with GS in Albania before he took her to Italy. I accept  that
       it can be hard to accurately recall dates and  even  the  length  of
       time that passes between events. I also accept that painful  matters
       can be difficult to recall with clarity. I  note  for  instance  the
       Appellant's comment in her asylum interview "when I  mention  [GS]'s
       name I make a lot of mistakes"[11].  I find that the chronology,  by
       which I mean the order of events narrated, has been consistent. I do
       not therefore attach much weight to such discrepancies.  The  matter
       which had particularly troubled the First-tier Tribunal was the fact
       that the Appellant had apparently paid a taxi driver  only  E20  for
       the  journey  to  Bari.   The  Appellant  was  unable  to  offer  an
       explanation for  that  matter,  but  that  does  not  mean  that  no
       explanation exists. It may be for instance that she got it wrong and
       that she had in fact paid him E200 in unfamiliar currency.  She  may
       never have been in Rome  at  all,  instead  being  given  deliberate
       misinformation by GS: it is her evidence that whilst in  'Rome'  she
       never went out[12].  Or it might simply be  that  the  taxi  driver,
       apprehending the situation, was motivated by  kindness  rather  than
       money; she did say that she was crying when she told him  where  she
       wanted to go. The Appellant  may  have  been  in  such  a  state  of
       distress and anxiety that she has got this wrong: she did say at her
       asylum interview, when mentioning the figure, that  she  "could  not
       remember"[13].  It was no doubt in recognition of such possibilities
       that the Respondent considered the determination of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal to be unsafe in that it appeared to place undue  weight  on
       this, what is now conceded to be a peripheral matter.

   19. Having considered all of the evidence in the round I  am  satisfied,
       on the lower standard of proof, that the Appellant  is  telling  the
       truth about her experiences and I find that the facts are as set out
       above.  She has been consistent as to the core  of  her  claim.  Her
       oral evidence before me was compelling and detailed. Her evidence is
       consonant with the country background material in respect of matters
       such as social attitudes towards women in Northern  Albania[14].  It
       is, I note, also consistent with objective research on  the  methods
       used by traffickers to control their  victims  such  as  threatening
       physical violence, exploiting the  woman's  fears  over  arrest  and
       deportation, and threatening family members.




       Risk Assessment


   20. The Respondent's refusal letter sets out a risk assessment conducted
       in light of the now defunct country  guidance  of  VD  (Trafficking)
       Albania [2004] UKIAT 00115. The current  guidance  on  survivors  of
       trafficking from Albania is set out in AM and BM (Trafficked  women)
       Albania CG [2010] UKUT 80 (IAC). I  have  also  had  regard  to  the
       decision in EH (Blood Feuds) Albania CG  [2012]  UKUT  00348  (IAC).
       The headnote of AM and BM reads:


         "a) It is not possible to set out a typical profile  of  trafficked
         women from Albania: trafficked women come from  all  areas  of  the
         country and from varied social backgrounds.


         b) At its worst the psychological damage inflicted on a  victim  of
         trafficking can lead to difficulties in reintegrating into Albanian
         society and has implications on whether or not it is  possible  for
         the victim of trafficking, should she fear persecution in  her  own
         area, to relocate.


         c) Much of Albanian society is governed by a strict code of  honour
         which  not  only  means  that  trafficked  women  would  have  very
         considerable difficulty in reintegrating into their home  areas  on
         return but also will affect their ability to  relocate  internally.
         Those  who  have  children  outside   marriage   are   particularly
         vulnerable. In extreme cases the close relatives of the  trafficked
         woman may refuse to have the trafficked woman's child  return  with
         her and could force her to abandon the child.


         d) Those that see themselves outside society, for example, divorced
         or abandoned women, or others who wish to live abroad, may seek out
         traffickers in order to facilitate their departure from Albania and
         their establishment in prostitution abroad. Although such women are
         not "trafficked women"  in  the  sense  that  they  have  not  been
         abducted against their will, there is  likely  to  be  considerable
         violence within the relationships and the psychological  affect  of
         that violence may lead to a situation  where  the  pressures  which
         they are under and the lack of freedom they are  under  means  that
         such women should be treated as trafficked women.


         e) The Albanian Government and  authorities  are  taking  steps  to
         protect trafficked women who return but such steps are  not  always
         effective. When considering whether or not there is  a  sufficiency
         of protection for a trafficked woman who  is  to  be  returned  her
         particular circumstances must be  considered.  Not  all  trafficked
         women  returning  to  Albania  will  be  unable   to   access   the
         arrangements and facilities  available  to  enable  successful  re-
         integration.


         f)  Trafficked  women  from  Albania  may  well  be  members  of  a
         particular social group on that account alone. Whether they are  at
         risk of persecution on account of such membership and whether  they
         will  be  able  to  access  sufficiency  of  protection  from   the
         authorities  will  depend  upon  their   individual   circumstances
         including but not limited to the following: 1)The social status and
         economic standing of the trafficked woman's family. 2) The level of
         education of the trafficked woman or her family. 3) The  trafficked
         woman's state of health, particularly her  mental  health.  4)  The
         presence of an illegitimate child. 5) The area  of  origin  of  the
         trafficked woman's family. 6) The trafficked woman's age.


   21. It is against that background that I consider whether the  Appellant
       is at risk today in Albania. I also bear in mind paragraph  339K  of
       the Immigration Rules:


         "339K.  The  fact  that  a  person  has  already  been  subject  to
         persecution or serous harm, or to direct threats  such  persecution
         or such harm, would be  regarded  as  a  serious  indication  of  a
         person's well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering
         serious harm  unless  there  are  good  reasons  to  consider  such
         persecution or serous harm would not be repeated."


   22. The Appellant's consistent evidence has been that her  home  village
       in Northern Albania is a small place. Her  former  husband's  family
       home lay only 20  metres  from  her  own[15].    The  Appellant  has
       escaped from GS and has left  her  'marriage'  to  him  without  his
       consent. He has already threatened her and  her  family  because  of
       this. Her own family have rejected her, and I take it from  her  own
       evidence the she has also rejected them for their failure to protect
       her from GS. I note that this evidence is consistent with the expert
       evidence heard by the Upper Tribunal in AM and  BM  which  suggested
       that the outcome for the returning survivor would be a  grim  choice
       between social rejection, being forced to marry against her will, or
       being re-trafficked:

         "it is likely, certainly in  the  more  traditional  parts  of  the
         country that, if such a woman is taken back that she will  be  kept
         hidden away, although in those cases where  the  family  have  been
         complicit in the trafficking of the women or  are  relying  on  the
         money that she is sending back it would be likely that  they  would
         assist her in again leaving the country. If,  however,  the  family
         had not been complicit in the removal of the woman and did not want
         to assist her, those relatives might well then endeavour to  ensure
         that the victim of trafficking was disposed  of,  probably  through
         marriage,  as  soon  as  possible.  Dr  Schwandner-Sievers  stated,
         however, that Albanian society is one where there  is  considerable
         gossip particularly in the villages and so it would not be possible
         for families to avoid others in their locality knowing  that  their
         daughter had been a victim of trafficking, and suffering the  shame
         and dishonour which that would bring on the family.


         153. For those reasons there will be cases  where  families  reject
         the victim of trafficking. She would then have to make her own  way
         to another locality.


         154. It is clear from Dr Schwandner-Sievers'  evidence  that  if  a
         victim of trafficking has a child there  would  be  cases  where  a
         family would not accept the child back as it  would  be  a  visible
         reminder of the fact that their daughter or sister  was  "unclean".
         In extreme cases children can be abandoned. There is evidence  that
         in the past honour killings have taken place  when  a  daughter  or
         sister is considered to have dishonoured the family by her  conduct
         even though she was the  victim  of  rape.  However,  the  evidence
         indicates that such "honour" killings are now very rare indeed".


   23.  Taking all of those factors into account I am satisfied that  there
       is a real risk of serious harm should the Appellant  return  to  her
       home area.  She would be immediately identifiable by the  family  of
       GS as well as her own and there is a real risk that she  would  face
       serious harm in the form set out above.


   24. Is there however an alterative for this  Appellant?  Could  she  not
       relocate within Albania and rely on the protection of  the  Albanian
       state?  It is the Appellant's evidence that  this  is  not  possible
       because of GS's connections throughout Albania. She relies  on  this
       regard on the fact that he was able to find her after  her  marriage
       to PL. Although only he  and  a  few  members  of  his  family  were
       directly involved in her trafficking it is apparent from  this  that
       he was able to employ the wider family  network  to  assist  him  in
       finding her. Having considered the evidence on  internal  relocation
       the panel in AM and BM accepted that the police are  able  to  refer
       women in the Appellant's position to shelters, and  that  there  are
       government-sponsored programs aimed at providing a start,  including
       basic education and micro-loans to  help  women  start  a  business.
       However:

          "57. Dr Schwandner-Sievers emphasised that the  reality  of  these
         various programmes was still that it would  be  difficult  for  any
         woman without family backing to get a job, that the agencies  would
         be likely to ensure that jobs  went  to  family  members  and  that
         societal discrimination would mean that anyone who is thought of as
         "kurv" would be shunned and have  difficulties  in  integrating  at
         work. Moreover men in workplaces would  be  likely  to  harass  any
         woman who  did  not  have  family  protection  and  this  would  be
         exacerbated in a situation where it was known that  the  woman  had
         come from abroad. She indicated that the shelters  were  themselves
         insecure  and  that  men,  knowing  that  they  housed  victims  of
         trafficking, would be likely to prowl around  the  centres  looking
         for women.


         158. We find that it is clear from the evidence that  a  victim  of
         trafficking, especially if accompanied by a small child, would find
         it significantly more  difficult  to  achieve  re-integration  into
         Albanian society than would be the case in  many  other  countries.
         But that does not mean that all such victims  of  trafficking  will
         fail to re-establish themselves.  Each  case  will  turn  upon  its
         particular facts. Among the features or characteristics  that  will
         be relevant to such an assessment are these:


         1) The social status  and  economic  standing  of  the  appellant's
         family;


         2) The level of education of the appellant and her family;


         3) The appellant's state of health, particularly her mental health;

         4) The presence of an illegitimate child;


         5) The area of origin of the appellant's family;


         6) The appellant's age.


         We note that among the group who were interviewed by Dr Davies many
         hoped to return to Albania to build homes, have children,  and  set
         up in business. We consider women  from  wealthier  backgrounds  or
         those who are better educated would find it easier to  reintegrate.
         Women from those groups would, however, be far less  likely  to  be
         trafficked in the first place.


         159. It is clear that  trafficking  is  a  serious  problem  within
         Albania and that  Albania  is  a  country  with  a  high  level  of
         corruption.  Although  we  accept  that  there  is  certainly  some
         statutory protection for trafficked women,  we  consider  that  the
         level of corruption is such that notwithstanding  that  there  have
         been prosecutions, traffickers may sometimes appear to operate with
         impunity..."


   25. Having considered the guidance above against the facts as  found  in
       this case I cannot be satisfied that the  Appellant  would  be  safe
       from persecution if she tried to live elsewhere in Albania. She  has
       a young baby who,  although  not  in  fact  illegitimate,  would  be
       perceived as such. Although she has a qualification as a hairdresser
       and has been able to do such work on her own in the past, she  would
       now have the additional hurdle of managing on her own, with a child,
       without family support. As Mr  Bonavero  points  out,  she  did  not
       manage for long without GS finding her.  The Appellant  is  still  a
       very young woman who has had a traumatic experience.  She  has  lost
       the support of her family, and latterly her husband and his. On  the
       particular facts of the case I find that she would be at a real risk
       of re-trafficking by GS, by his associates or by  other  traffickers
       who  could  exploit  her  vulnerability  as  an  unmarried   mother.
       Furthermore she would be unlikely in these circumstances to be  able
       to benefit from sufficient protection by the Albanian state.






         Decisions


   26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside by consent.


   27. I re-make the decision in the appeal as follows:

   i) the appeal is allowed on asylum grounds;
  ii) the Appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection  because  she
      is a refugee;
 iii) the appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

   28. Having had regard Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
       Rules 2008 I make an order for anonymity in the following terms:


            "Unless and until a tribunal or a court directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify the Appellant, nor any member
         of her family. This direction applies to the Appellant as  well  as
         to the Respondent. Failure to comply with this direction could lead
         to contempt of Court proceedings".

[14] See for instance paragraph 138 of AM and BM (Trafficked women) Albania
CG [2010] UKUT 80 (IAC): "It is arguable that, although women are
trafficked from all over Albania, Roma and women and girls from the north
are particularly vulnerable of being duped or abducted by traffickers. That
appears to be largely because the north is a more traditional area where
girls are kept separate from males outside the family and may well not have
the opportunity to go onto a secondary school, being kept at home until
marriage. It is an area where arranged marriages are common and where a
woman is unlikely to be able to make her own choice of husband".
