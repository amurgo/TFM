                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Albania born in 1987.  He  arrived  in
       the UK illegally in 2012. On 8th  September  2014  he  was  given  a
       conditional discharge of 12 months for possession of a class A drug.
       He married DA, a British citizen, on 30th  September  2014.  He  was
       convicted of a number of criminal offences, the most  serious  being
       possession with intent to supply of a class A drugs  which  resulted
       in his being sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of two
       years and six months on 14th September 2015. A deportation order was
       made against him on 9th December 2015. He was deported to Albania on
       19th April 2016.

    2. The appellant re-entered the UK illegally in January  2017,  and  in
       July 2017 submitted an application to revoke his  deportation  order
       on human rights grounds. He then left the UK again in  August  2018.
       On 4th October 2018 the application to revoke the deportation  order
       was refused with an out of  country  appeal,  and  that  appeal  was
       lodged on 1st November 2018.

    3. On 4th December 2018 the appellant was arrested  in  the  UK  again,
       having re-entered illegally due to his wife's ill health. He claimed
       asylum on 6th December 2018. On 8th January 2019 the  appellant  was
       served with a s.72 letter, and in February 2019 he responded to this
       letter.

    4. This appeal is the one lodged by the appellant on 1st November  2018
       against the decision of 4th October  2018  refusing  to  revoke  the
       appellant's deportation order.  The  appeal  was  dismissed  on  all
       grounds in a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ian  Howard
       promulgated on 31st January 2020. In a decision promulgated  on  8th
       October 2020 I found that the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in  law
       and set aside the decision and all of  the  findings.  I  append  my
       decision, with my full reasoning as Annex A to this decision.

    5. The matter comes before me again to remake the appeal.  The  hearing
       is held once again via Skype for Business in light of  the  need  to
       reduce the transmission of the Covid-19 virus, and in light of  this
       being found to be acceptable by both parties, and being a  means  by
       which the appeal could be fairly and justly determined.  There  were
       no  significant  issues  of  connectivity  or  audibility  with  the
       hearing.

    6. It is accepted by both parties that  this  appeal  firstly  concerns
       whether the appellant  can  show  that  he  meets  the  family  life
       Exception  2  to  deportation  as  set  out  at  s.117C(5)  of   the
       Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002;  or  if  he  cannot
       whether he can show that there  are  very  compelling  circumstances
       over and above this exception as  set  out  at  s.117C  (6)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  Binaku  (s.11  TCEA;
       S.117C NIAA; para.399D) 2021 UKUT 34 (IAC) applied.

    7. In light of the updating medical evidence, which related both to the
       treatment of the appellant's wife, DA, in the UK  and  also  to  the
       availability of treatment for  her  medical  condition  in  Albania,
       served  in  an  electronic  updating  bundle  by  Rashid  &   Rashid
       Solicitors on the day  of  the  hearing,  and  which  supported  the
       contention that  she  would  not  be  able  to  obtain  one  of  the
       medications on which she is periodically reliant in Albania and that
       other treatment for her condition would be very expensive  and  well
       beyond those  earning  normal  wages  in  Albania  Mr  Tufan  fairly
       conceded that it would be unduly harsh for the appellant's wife, DA,
       and child, LA, to live with him in  Albania.  As  a  result  it  was
       agreed that the first focus of the hearing was whether it  would  be
       unduly harsh for the appellant's wife and child to remain in the  UK
       without him whilst having occasional visits to him in  Albania;  and
       the  second  issue  was  whether  there  were  any  very  compelling
       circumstances over and above the  exceptions  to  deportation  which
       would make his removal a breach of Article 8 ECHR.

Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

    8. The salient evidence of the appellant, as set  out  in  his  witness
       statement and oral evidence is, in summary, as follows. He  came  to
       the UK from Albania in May 2013 in  search  of  a  better  life  for
       himself and to support his parents. He  says  he  was  tricked  into
       believing that he did not have to pay for his being brought here  as
       the agents appeared like friends, and was shocked when he understood
       from them he had to pay them �10,000. They beat him up when he  said
       he did not have the money, and as a result he agreed to pay  them  a
       weekly amount, and by October 2014 he had paid off �6000, but if  he
       missed a weekly instalment they would assault him. He  says  he  was
       too afraid to seek medical help or go to the police about  them.  He
       met his wife, then DB and now DA, first  in  December  2013  through
       friends, they lost touch  but  met  up  again  in  April  2014.  The
       relationship developed quickly, and they moved in together,  and  in
       Summer 2014 he proposed in McDonalds restaurant when they  were  out
       with friends. They were married at Dumfries Registry Office on  30th
       September 2014 in the presence of close friends. His  wife  knew  he
       had immigration problems but was unaware about the money he owed  to
       the agents as he kept this matter to himself as culturally this  was
       not a matter a man would share with his partner.

    9. In  2013  the  appellant's  wife  was  diagnosed  as  having  immune
       thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This is a  bleeding  disorder  where
       the immune system destroys blood platelets which  are  necessary  to
       cause clotting. It can be brought on by  depression  and  tiredness.
       Her condition worsened in 2014 and 2015. She was working  very  hard
       to support both of them, and also developed severe backache.

   10. In November 2014 the agents who had brought him to the  UK  came  to
       his house when his wife was not home,  and  demanded  the  remaining
       �4000 immediately, when he said he could not pay them a man hit  him
       with a gun on the head. They then offered him  another  way  to  pay
       them back. He should keep a black bin bag in his house and not  look
       at the contents. If he did not do this the  agents  threatened  that
       they would harm his wife, her family in the UK  and  his  family  in
       Albania. He agreed to look after the bag. He explained  his  bruises
       etc to his wife by saying that he had had  a  misunderstanding  with
       someone in the street. The appellant and his wife had to leave their
       home and move in with friends on a temporary basis, but he took  the
       bag with him. On 16th November 2014 the police raided  this  address
       and took the drugs which were in the bag and arrested both  him  and
       his wife. The appellant says he pleaded guilty to the offence so  as
       to get his wife out of the mess, as she had nothing to do  with  it.
       She was released after three days.  He  told  the  judge  about  the
       threats and the other people who were  involved,  and  was  given  a
       lower, 30 month, sentence although the judge viewed  him  as  having
       been stupid.

   11. The appellant left the UK voluntarily in April 2016 and returned  to
       Albania as a legal aid solicitor  advised  him  he  could  apply  to
       return after one year. His wife visited  him  in  Albania  on  three
       occasions, although the doctors advised her not to travel  when  she
       insisted on travelling  she  was  given  extra  medication  for  the
       visits. His wife had two miscarriages:  one  whilst  in  custody  in
       November 2014 and another in October 2019.

   12. In November 2018  the  appellant's  wife  was  told  she  needed  an
       operation to remove her spleen, which would have meant  she  had  no
       immune system, and  he  decided  that  he  should  re-enter  the  UK
       illegally so he could be there with her, and this is why he returned
       to the UK on this occasion, although in the end that  operation  did
       not take place. In December 2018 he was detained by the  Immigration
       Service but in March 2019 they released him on bail to live with his
       wife. He has lived continuously with his wife since that time.

   13. When the appellant's wife was pregnant initially her ITP was alright
       but in the last three months things became complicated, and  at  one
       point she was taken to hospital in Canterbury and then to London. He
       spent 7 days sleeping in a chair next to her in Canterbury, and  she
       then spent 5 days in London. During the pregnancy he  had  to  cook,
       shop and keep house. Their daughter LA  was  born  in  August  2020.
       After the caesarean birth his wife's condition deteriorated and  her
       blood became dangerously thick, with the platelets going from 250 to
       950, and there was a risk of clotting and as a  result  she  had  to
       spend a week in hospital. For the first three months  after  LA  was
       born he did not let his wife do anything bar  rest  and  have  fresh
       air, he did everything to care for the baby, with lots  of  skin  to
       skin contact, and also of course brought LA  to  his  wife  so  they
       could have time together. His wife's ITP is currently  in  remission
       and she is well.

   14. They have had to keep away from others due  to  Covid-19  since  his
       daughter was born, and initially his wife was shielding. Now she  is
       not shielding but her doctors have not yet decided if she should  be
       vaccinated due to the risk of blood clots which she is vulnerable to
       anyway due to her ITP. So far LA has not had  any  health  problems.
       The appellant is central to LA's routines, and particularly  bedtime
       as he almost always deals with this and is able to get her to go  to
       sleep more easily than his wife. He and his wife take turns to go to
       her during the night if she wakes depending who hears her first  and
       is awake.

   15. The appellant says that he is a  reformed  character  and  will  not
       commit any criminal offences in the future. He has done courses  and
       has qualifications, and so has the skills to find a  good  job.  His
       wife has a good job as a deputy residential care manager in the  UK,
       and needs to remain in this country for her  medical  treatment.  He
       will not be reliant on benefits  if  allowed  to  remain.  His  wife
       cannot afford to pay for tickets to visit him frequently in  Albania
       and does not have sufficient holiday to do this. They have both been
       reliant on antidepressants in the past, and receiving counselling as
       a result of the stress that separation placed upon them.

   16. The appellant says that it would be terrible if he were not  allowed
       to remain in the UK, particularly now  that  he  and  his  wife  are
       parents. He cannot imagine his  daughter  growing  up  without  both
       parents, and has bonded with her completely from the  time  she  was
       born. He feels his deportation would be unfair and traumatic for LA,
       and also would not be good for his relationship with his wife. He is
       also concerned that if his wife had a relapse of her  ITP  that  she
       would not be able to cope. In these times his wife has body and bone
       aches, and is barely able to lift her phone let alone feed,  change,
       bath and play for baby LA. His wife does not  have  family  she  can
       turn to, her mother died when she was 12 years old, and she is  only
       close to her Dad and he is 60 years old and runs  his  own  business
       and could not cope with looking after LA. She has a half-sister from
       her mother but does not get on with her; she has some  more  distant
       relatives but they do not live close by and have work so  would  not
       have time to help out.

   17. The key evidence of DA, the appellant's wife, as set out in her  two
       witness statements and oral evidence is, in summary, as follows. She
       is a British citizen. She confirms that she has read the appellant's
       statement and agrees with the contents. She knows that the appellant
       is very sorry for his actions which led to him being imprisoned  and
       having to leave the UK and  her.  She  believes  that  he  is  truly
       transformed since that time: he is willing to discuss  problems;  he
       is more considerate; is a great listener and cares and supports  her
       emotionally.

   18. Prior to her daughter, LA being born, she worked very hard, up to 80
       hours a week, so that she could support the appellant as he was, and
       remains, unable to work. She is a deputy manager working with adults
       with learning difficulties. Tiredness can trigger her  ITP.  She  is
       emotionally  very  reliant  on  the  appellant,  and  his  uncertain
       immigration status has made her anxious and depressed, and  she  has
       had treatment for these conditions including counselling. She needed
       treatment to conceive their daughter due to her ITP. Before  LA  was
       born she worked from April 2020 to August  2020  from  home  in  the
       context of the Covid-19 pandemic. She plans to return to work  part-
       time in June of this year. During an ITP relapse, even if she is not
       hospitalised, this does  affect  her  ability  to  do  certain  more
       challenging aspects of her work.

   19. DA feels it would be very harsh to make the appellant leave  the  UK
       as she believes that the bond between the appellant and LA  is  even
       stronger than the one she has with LA.  He puts her to bed as a rule
       every evening and on the couple of times she has tried to put her to
       bed it has taken must longer for her to settle; and LA  eyes  always
       light up when she sees him. LA is a real daddy's girl. She would not
       want LA to be brought up by a single parent as  she  was  after  her
       mother died.

   20. DA explained that her ITP is in remission but she gets  fatigue  and
       body aches from the medication she has previously had to take and so
       she can struggle with LA who is always  on  the  go,  and  sometimes
       needs the appellant to care for her for a day.  She  does  not  have
       other family to turn to as she is just close to her dad, but he  has
       his own scaffolding business which is currently very  busy  after  a
       lull during lockdown and he is working 6  days  a  week.  Her  wider
       family consists  only  of  relatives  on  her  father's  side:   her
       grandmother is too old to help out, and her aunts work in  hospitals
       and so are too busy working full time, and it's  too  risky  to  ask
       them anyway. In addition, and despite shielding,  she  got  Covid-19
       and was unwell for a week and sadly now has some long Covid symptoms
       including chest pains and shortness of breath, and so is due to have
       a chest x-ray soon. Her consultant is still considering  whether  it
       would be safe for her to have the vaccine given the blood clot  risk
       and fears it could trigger a relapse in her ITP.

   21. DA feels she would not be able to manage with LA when she has an ITP
       relapse if the appellant was  not  in  the  UK.  Most  commonly  the
       relapse is sudden and  dramatic,  and  she  has  to  spend  time  in
       hospital, and other relatives could not step in and care for LA full
       time. The appellant is fully informed about her ITP, and has  always
       accompanied her to medical appointments and is  able  to  do  things
       like inject her with medication if she is unable to do this  and  is
       always willing to care for her when this is needed.

   22. Rashid & Rashid Solicitors lodged  on  the  day  of  the  hearing  a
       supplementary bundle which contained 136 pages  of  medical  letters
       for DA, much relating to her pregnancy,  and  not  in  chronological
       order but spanning the period 2018 to 2021. I was not taken  to  any
       of this evidence by Ms Daykin. DA's  medical  condition  is  not  in
       dispute so I simply note that what is said in these  letters  is  in
       keeping with the evidence given by the appellant and DA  about  DA's
       medical conditions,  and high-light the following.

   23. Dr Gillian Evans, Consultant Haematologist in  her  a  letter  dated
       14th May 2020 clarifies that ITP is  a  condition  which  can  cause
       bruising, nosebleeds, mouth bleeding, but also more serious internal
       bleeding and can be occasionally fatal. It needs to  be  managed  by
       specialist haematologists. DA has "severe refractory relapsing  ITP"
       She has had many different types of treatments since  her  diagnosis
       in 2013. She came off treatment in May 2019 so  as  to  be  able  to
       become pregnant by taking a powerful immune suppressant,  but  after
       becoming pregnant needed treatment again to stabilise  her  platelet
       count. DA needed her pregnancy to be managed by a centre  with  full
       ITP expertise as there were risks both to her and her  unborn  baby.
       After the birth of LA she needed to have chemotherapy type treatment
       due to her condition, and there is  a  schedule  of  her  treatments
       dated 13th October 2020 for October and November. An updating letter
       from Dr Evans dated 15th March 2021 confirms that DA is currently in
       remission and not needing  treatment  but  that  she  is  likely  to
       relapse in the future, but the timing and severity of  the  relapses
       are unpredictable. It is her opinion that she is best treated by the
       team of doctors who understand her complex condition which has  been
       resistant to many treatments.

   24. There are two letters from Think Action dated October and July  2019
       for the appellant and DA respectively. In relation to the  appellant
       the cognitive behavioural therapist concluded that he  had  symptoms
       of PTSD and depression, including flashbacks and  depression  caused
       by living in limbo. A report of psychiatrist  Dr  M  Kashmiri  dated
       15th December 2018 found whilst in detention he was  suffering  from
       mixed anxiety and depressive disorder. The Think  Action  letter  in
       relation to DA concluded that she had severe generalised anxious and
       depression, and outlines that she had taken part in  seven  sessions
       provided by the service. No reference was made to this  evidence  by
       Ms Daykin.

   25. Mr Tufan argued for the Secretary of State that the appeal should be
       dismissed as it would not be unduly harsh for DA to remain in the UK
       and care for LA  without  the  appellant,  with  occasional  holiday
       visits to him in Albania as DA had done in the past. He argued  that
       the appellant was just helping out with the care of his daughter  in
       the normal way, and there was nothing out of  the  ordinary  on  the
       facts of this case. He argued that this was still the proper test as
       set out in KO (Nigeria)v SSHD [2018] UKSC  53,  and  that  this  was
       reflected in the Court of Appeal decision  at  paragraph  42  of  HA
       (Iraq) v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ117 As Mr Justice Sedley found in Lee v
       SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 248 separating  families  is  what  deportation
       does, and this is lawful. If DA has to go into  hospital  due  to  a
       relapse in her ITP then Social Services would  be  there  to  assist
       her, and it was proper to take note  of  this,  as  per  BL(Jamaica)
       [2016] EWCA Civ 357. Mr Tufan argued that there were  also  no  very
       compelling circumstances over and above the exceptions. The offences
       for which the appellant was convicted were serious, and he got a two
       and a half year prison sentence. The appellant could not claim to be
       rehabilitated as he  had  broken  the  law  in  re-entering  the  UK
       illegally after his  criminal  convictions  and  in  any  case  Lord
       Justice Underhill had found in HA (Iraq) that  rehabilitation  alone
       was rarely a matter to which great weight could be given.

   26. Ms Daykin argued in her skeleton argument and oral submissions  that
       the appeal should be allowed. She argued that  it  would  be  unduly
       harsh to DA and LA for the appellant to  be  deported,  and  so  the
       appellant qualifies under Exception 2 as set out at s.117C(5) of the
       Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.  DA  and  LA  are
       qualifying partner and child because they are both British citizens.

   27. Ms Daykin argues that the test for unduly harsh is now to  be  found
       properly  articulated  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in   HA   (Iraq),
       particularly at paragraphs 44 and 56 of the  judgement,  with  clear
       reference to KO (Nigeria) as the starting point  for  the  decision.
       There is no requirement  of  exceptionality  just  a  fact  specific
       analysis to see if the necessary degree of  harshness  to  meet  the
       test was present. It is argued that it would be unduly harsh on  the
       facts of this case because LA is a young baby of  eight  months  and
       could not have a relationship with the appellant other  than  if  he
       remains in the UK as her relationship can only be a physical face to
       face one; she lives with the appellant and has a particularly  close
       physical bond with him and he is intimately involved with her  daily
       routine and LA would be bereft if he were to have to leave the UK as
       she has a clear emotional bond with him and there would be no way to
       explain his absence to her or for her to understand it other than as
       an abandonment, as was found in AA (Nigeria)v SSHD [2020] EWCA 1296;
       further due to DA's physical ill health DA would not be able to cope
       reliably with providing all the physical care for LA on her own,  as
       her medical condition is one which has historically had a number  of
       relapses and further these are sudden and unpredictable, and DA does
       not have other family members on whom she can rely as they  are  all
       working and for LA to have to go into the care of Social Services in
       such circumstances would be traumatic and unduly harsh  for  DA  and
       LA.

   28. It is  argued  that  there  are  very  compelling  circumstances  as
       although the conviction for possession  with  intent  to  supply  of
       class A drugs is a serious one the sentencing  remarks  of  Recorder
       Dunn-Shaw refer to the fact  that  the  appellant  was  coerced  and
       exploited into becoming involved with the criminal behaviour and  he
       was also given a sentence at the lower end; and further the criminal
       behaviour which led to these convictions took  place  in  2014,  and
       since that time the appellant has no further convictions.  It  ought
       to be seen that he is now rehabilitated, and that  the  re-entry  to
       the UK was only motivated by concern  for  the  appellant's  serious
       unwell wife, and  again  would  not  be  indicative  of  any  future
       unlawful behaviour. It is argued that the  particular  circumstances
       relating to the appellant's conviction mean that  in  an  Article  8
       ECHR balancing exercise his family life, with all of its  individual
       characteristics as outlined above, outweighs the public interest  in
       his deportation.

Conclusions - Remaking

   29. The index offence in this case is possession of a  class  A  control
       drug, cocaine, with intent to supply together  with  two  counts  of
       possession of  an  identity  document  with  intent  for  which  the
       appellant was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment. In his sentencing
       remarks Recorder Dunn-Shaw accepted  that  the  appellant  possessed
       with intent to supply  a  large  amount  of  class  A  drugs  "under
       coercion" and that his "naivety was exploited". He was given  a  30%
       discount for his guilty plea. Recorder Dunn-Shaw  also  acknowledged
       that the appellant's wife relied upon him to assist in the event  of
       emergencies or difficulties.

   30. As set out at s.117C(1) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
       Act 2002 the deportation of the appellant as a foreign  criminal  is
       in the public interest, and as set out at s.117C(2) the more serious
       the offence the greater the  public  interest  in  his  deportation.
       Drugs offences are acknowledged to be particularly serious offences,
       and thus there is a  weighty  public  interest  in  the  appellant's
       deportation.

   31. In Binaku  the Upper Tribunal found as follows: "A foreign  criminal
       who has re-entered  the  United  Kingdom  in  breach  of  an  extant
       deportation order is subject to the same deportation regime as those
       who have yet to be removed or who have been removed and are  seeking
       a revocation of a deportation order from abroad. The phrases  "cases
       concerning the deportation of foreign criminals" in section  117A(2)
       and "a decision to deport a foreign criminal" in section 117C(7) are
       to be interpreted accordingly"

   32. It follows that the first question that arises  in  this  appeal  is
       whether the appellant can meet  the  Exception  2,  as  set  out  at
       s.117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. It is
       accepted by the  respondent  that  he  has  genuine  and  subsisting
       relationships with his qualifying partner, his wife DA, and  with  a
       qualifying child, his daughter, LA. Both are  "qualifying"  as  they
       are British citizens. To meet Exception 2  the  appellant  needs  to
       show it would unduly harsh both for them to accompany him to live in
       Albania and to remain in the UK without him. However it  is  rightly
       conceded by Mr Tufan for the respondent that  the  medical  evidence
       and evidence regarding treatment for ITP  in  Albania,  particularly
       from the Spitali Amerikan  in  Tirana  at  pages  9  to  22  of  the
       supplementary bundle, means that it would be unduly harsh for DA and
       LA to have to live in Albania due to the high cost of her  necessary
       medical treatment, low  wages  in  that  country  and  the  lack  of
       availability of a medication on which DA is periodically reliant. As
       a result I need only making findings  as  to  whether  it  would  be
       unduly harsh for  DA  and  LA  to  remain  in  the  UK  without  the
       appellant, although with periodic holidays to see him in Albania, to
       establish whether Exception 2 is met or not.  If  the  appellant  is
       unable to meet this test then  it  will  be  necessary  to  consider
       whether there are very compelling circumstances over and above  this
       Exception  in  accordance  with  s.117C  (6)  of  the   Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

   33. I find both witnesses to be credible. There was no  submission  from
       Mr Tufan to the contrary, and their  oral  evidence  was  consistent
       with each other, with  their  written  statements,  with  the  other
       documentary evidence and was heart felt and detailed.  The  question
       is therefore whether the appellant  can  meet  the  requirements  of
       either Exception 2 or the very compelling circumstances test on  the
       facts of his case.

   34. From HA (Iraq), which builds on the decision of the Supreme Court in
       KO (Nigeria),  particularly at paragraph 44 and 56 of the judgement,
       the test of what is "unduly harsh" with respect to a child remaining
       in the UK whilst a parent is deported is one which may be summarised
       as follows. It is a matter  of  determining  whether  the  level  of
       harshness goes beyond what is acceptable:  this  in  turn  does  not
       require something exceptional or rare, indeed it might be that undue
       harshness is quite common. It would not be lawful to find that  some
       level of undue harshness was ordinary and therefore  acceptable.  Of
       course deportation  separates  families  and  the  fact  of  such  a
       separation alone does not suffice, and of course the potential  role
       of Social Service can be considered where relevant. What is required
       is a  fact  sensitive  analysis  with  a  number  of  factors  being
       particularly relevant: the age of the child; whether the child lives
       with the parent being deported; the degree of  emotional  dependence
       on  the  parent  being  deported  by  the   child;   the   financial
       consequences of deportation; the available  emotional  support  from
       the remaining parent and other family members; the  practicality  of
       maintaining  a  relationship  with  the  deported  parent;  and  the
       individual characteristics of the child.

   35. In this case LA, the appellant's daughter, is just 8 months old. She
       is a healthy normally developing baby to date. I find that LA has  a
       very close physical relationship and strong emotional bond with  the
       appellant. They live together and have always done so as part  of  a
       nuclear family with, his wife and her mother, DA. He is particularly
       heavily involved with her day to day care because DA has  a  serious
       physical medical condition which periodically leaves her  tired  and
       in pain, and in the context of DA having  undergone  a  chemotherapy
       treatment for her ITP and having contracted Covid-19 in the 8 months
       since LA's birth. The appellant puts LA to bed each night,  and  for
       the first three months of her life did  all  of  the  physical  work
       (changing nappies, washing, putting to bed, playing) connected  with
       his new born  daughter  to  allow  his  wife  to  recover  from  the
       caesarean birth in the context of her ill-health and  previous  drug
       treatment to enable DA to have a healthy pregnancy. If the appellant
       were deported there would be no way to replicate  this  relationship
       via social media, letter or phone, as it is one  based  on  face  to
       face and skin to skin (as the appellant put it) contact between  the
       two of them for a large part of each day. Occasional holidays  could
       also not  sustain  this  relationship.  LA  is  also  too  young  to
       comprehend any explanation as to what had happened to the  appellant
       if  he  were  deported,  half  of  her  world  would   simply   have
       inexplicably disappeared. I find that this would be very distressing
       for her.

   36. I find that if the appellant were deported DA would be left to  care
       for her daughter LA alone on a day to day basis. Her own mother died
       when she was 12 years old and she has no contact with  the  maternal
       side of her family. She has a good relationship with her father  who
       is a 60 year old man running a scaffolding business,  and  currently
       working  6  days  a  week  after  lean  times  during  the  Covid-19
       lockdowns, but he  is  not  in  a  position  to  provide  help  with
       childcare; other more distant relatives such as her two  aunts  also
       work full time, and in their case in the Health Services which would
       pose an infection risk at the current time, and are likewise  unable
       to provide practical help. I find that DA,  clearly  an  intelligent
       woman, would generally cope whilst she is in remission with her  ITP
       with caring for LA if she had to do so alone, although it  would  be
       tiring and difficult as it is for most single parents, and I do note
       that she has had a history of anxiety  and  depression  which  might
       return. However, I find that DA would be unable  to  cope  with  the
       care of LA when she had a recurrence of her  ITP  disease,  and  the
       medical evidence is that this is likely and the timing and  severity
       of such a relapse unpredictable. Whether DA was hospitalised or  not
       I find that that it is probable that she would be unable at  such  a
       time to care for a lively 8 month baby, shortly to become a toddler,
       alone given the tiredness and  pain  it  engenders.  I  accept  that
       Social Services would have a legal responsibility to help, but  find
       that this would be extremely traumatic for LA if without warning she
       suddenly lost the care and continuity of her  one  remaining  parent
       having, from her perspective, inexplicably lost  the  appellant.  It
       would also be very traumatic for DA to have  her  child  taken  into
       care as well as having to deal simultaneously with a  recurrence  of
       her serious ITP condition.

   37. In these circumstances I find that it is overwhelmingly in LA's best
       interests that the appellant remain in the UK,  and  also  that  the
       impact of the appellant's departure would be unacceptably, and  thus
       unduly, harsh for LA and DA for the reasons I  set  out  above.   In
       addition, and whilst this is the not the necessary test,  the  facts
       of this case are not, I find, ordinary: the appellant's relationship
       with his daughter is particularly physically and  emotionally  close
       and irreplaceable at a  distance;  the  appellant's  partner  has  a
       serious and unpredictable physical health condition, ITP, which  her
       consultant says will reoccur and I find will mean  she  cannot  care
       for her daughter alone; and the appellant  and  his  wife,  DA,  are
       bringing up her their baby daughter, LA, together  without  possible
       help from wider family.

   38. It follows that  Exception  2,  as  set  out  at  s.117C(5)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is met by the appellant
       as his deportation would be unduly harsh to his daughter LA and  his
       wife DA. I therefore do not need to consider whether there are  very
       compelling  circumstances  over  and  above   this   Exceptions   in
       accordance with s.117C  (6)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
       Asylum Act 2002. As I find that the appellant can show he  can  meet
       the  terms  of  Exception  2  then  the  public  interest  does  not
       ultimately require his deportation and he is entitled to  remain  in
       the UK on Article 8 ECHR human rights grounds.



          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
      appeal and all of the findings.

   3. I re-make the appeal by allowing it on Article  8  ECHR  human  rights
      grounds.



Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings. I do so to protect the privacy of his wife in relation  to  her
medical condition.

Annex A: Error of Law Decision:


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The appellant is a citizen of Albania born in 1987.  He  arrived  in
       the UK illegally in 2012. On 8th  September  2014  he  was  given  a
       conditional discharge of 12 months for possession of a class A drug.
       He married DB, a British citizen, on 30th  September  2014.  He  was
       convicted of a number of criminal offences including possession with
       intent to supply of a class A drugs  which  resulted  in  his  being
       sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a period of  two  years  and
       six months on 14th September 2015.  A  deportation  order  was  made
       against him on 9th December 2015. He was deported to Albania on 19th
       April 2016.

    2. The appellant re-entered the UK illegally in January  2017,  and  in
       July 2017 submitted an application to revoke his  deportation  order
       on human rights grounds. He then left the UK again in  August  2018.
       On 4th October 2018 the application to revoke the deportation  order
       was refused with an out of country appeal, and an appeal was  lodged
       on 1st November 2018.

    3. On 4th December 2018 the appellant was arrested in the UK again, and
       said that he had re-entered illegally due to his wife's ill  health.
       He claimed asylum on 6th December 2018.  On  8th  January  2019  the
       appellant was served with a s.72 letter, and  in  February  2019  he
       responded to this letter.

    4. This appeal is the one lodged by the appellant on 1st November  2018
       against the decision of 4th October  2018  refusing  to  revoke  the
       appellant's deportation order.  The  appeal  was  dismissed  on  all
       grounds in a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Ian  Howard
       promulgated on 31st January 2020.

    5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       JM Holmes on the 3rd March 2020 on all grounds  but  principally  on
       the basis that it was arguable  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
       erred in  law  in  finding,  contrary  to  the  evidence,  that  the
       appellant's British citizen  wife  could  live  in  Albania  in  the
       context of her health condition.

    6. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law. The hearing was held at  a  remote  Skype
       for Business hearing in light of the need to reduce the transmission
       of the Covid-19 virus, and in  light  of  this  being  found  to  be
       acceptable by both parties, and being a means by  which  the  appeal
       could be fairly and justly  determined.  There  were  no  issues  of
       connectivity or audibility with the hearing, which was joined by the
       appellant and his spouse from their solicitors' offices.

Submissions - Error of Law

    7. In grounds of appeal and in  further  submissions  provided  to  the
       Upper Tribunal, both drafted by Ms E Daykin for the  appellant,  and
       in oral submissions from Ms Daykin it is argued for  the  appellant,
       in summary, as follows.

    8. Firstly, it is argued that the First-tier Tribunal failed to look at
       all matters collectively when deciding there were no very compelling
       circumstances which meant it was not lawful to deport the appellant.
       There are separate conclusions on mitigating factors relating to the
       offence, the appellant's mental health,  the  appellant's  partner's
       mental health etc. but there was failure to stand back and assessing
       the totality of these matters  to  see  if  they  amounted  to  very
       compelling circumstances.

    9. Secondly, it is argued that the First-tier Tribunal irrationally  or
       with insufficient reasons failed to place any weight on  the  mental
       health issues suffered by the appellant attributing them all to  his
       being detained, and failed unlawfully to  give  any  weight  to  the
       Think Action letter of 16th October 2019 despite the fact  that  the
       appellant had not been detained for 10 months and was, according  to
       this letter, still suffering from PTSD and depression.

   10. Thirdly, it is argued that there was a failure to  fully  take  into
       account the medical evidence relating to the appellant's  wife  from
       her  consultant  haematologist  which  was  that  she  needs  to  be
       regularly monitored and in  regular  access  to  her  UK  healthcare
       because otherwise she could  bleed  to  death,  and  that  her  life
       expectancy without treatment would be very short. Although sometimes
       her condition is in remission the evidence showed that she  had  had
       two relapses since 2013. It was irrational  on  the  basis  of  this
       evidence for the First-tier Tribunal  to  have  concluded  that  the
       appellant's wife could live safely in Albania and travel back to the
       UK for treatment when this were needed.

   11. Fourthly it is argued that the  First-tier  Tribunal  has  erred  by
       conducting a separate Article 8 ECHR balancing exercise after having
       considered whether there are very compelling circumstances under the
       deportation Immigration Rules which is contrary to the higher courts
       guidance that the Immigration Rules represent  a  complete  code  in
       deportation matters, and as some matters arise only in one of  these
       considerations, such as finding the appellant's offending is at  the
       lower end of the spectrum in the separate Article  8  ECHR  exercise
       only, there is evidence that this amounted to a  material  error  of
       law by the First-tier Tribunal.

   12.  In  the  further  submissions  from  Ms  Daykin  submitted  by  her
       instructing solicitors to the Upper Tribunal on 20th  May  2020  she
       also makes an application  to  admit  further  evidence  under  Rule
       15(2A) of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules  with  respect  to  the
       appellant's spouse's ill health on the basis that  this  is  an  on-
       going issue which needs to be updated in light of her pregnancy  and
       further treatment she has received. The medical letter  is  from  Dr
       Gillian   Evans,   the   appellant's   wife   treating    consultant
       haematologist  and  is  dated  12th  May  2020.   Rashid  &   Rashid
       Solicitors have also provided a  copy  of  the  appellant's  child's
       birth certificate showing his daughter L was born in August 2020. It
       was accepted by Ms Daykin that these documents only had relevance to
       a remaking hearing so there was no  application  to  admit  them  in
       relation to the issue of whether the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
       law.

   13. Mr Clarke defended the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  He
       accepted that there had  been  an  error  of  law  in  conducting  a
       separate Article 8 ECHR exercise  after  that  relating  to  whether
       there were  very  compelling  and  compassionate  circumstances  but
       argued that this was not in any way a  material  error  of  law.  Mr
       Clarke also pointed out that the relevant test was that at paragraph
       399D of the Immigration Rules, as this was a revocation appeal,  and
       there would have to be very exceptional  circumstances  to  outweigh
       the public interest in deportation, although he also  accepted  that
       this test probably did not  materially  differ  from  that  of  very
       compelling,  compassionate  circumstances   over   and   above   the
       exceptions to deportation.  Mr  Clarke  submitted  that  the  errors
       raised in this appeal could not enable the appellant  to  meet  this
       very high test so were ultimately immaterial.

   14. Mr Clarke also argued that there was no unlawful segregating of  the
       issues when looking at whether there were  compelling  compassionate
       circumstances over and above the exceptions  to  deportation  as  at
       paragraph 38 of the decision it is concluded that "all in all" there
       were  no  such  circumstances,  and  this   implies   a   cumulative
       assessment. He argued that the Think Action letter was  such  slight
       evidence, giving no details of the qualifications of the  author  or
       the techniques used to come to the PTSD  and  depression  diagnosis,
       that it was properly concluded that it took the medical evidence  no
       further than the  psychiatrist's  report  from  the  time  when  the
       appellant was in detention. With respect  to  the  medical  evidence
       relating to the appellant's wife it is argued that the three medical
       letters from Dr Evans of 2015, 2017 and  2019  were  all  considered
       properly by the First-tier Tribunal and the fact was at the time  of
       hearing the appellant's wife's condition was in  remission  and  she
       was drug free. The  medical  evidence  indicated,  contrary  to  the
       appellant's wife's oral evidence,  that it would be possible for the
       appellant's wife to go to Albania, and indeed it was clear that  she
       had visited on three occasions, and so it was right that the  First-
       tier Tribunal took this into account. There was a  lack  of  medical
       evidence as to what would happen  in  the  future,  and  so  it  was
       lawfully open to the First-tier Tribunal relying on the most  recent
       medical letter to conclude that the appellant's wife could live with
       him in Albania.

Conclusions - Error of Law

   15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal finds at paragraphs 22 to 25
       that the appellant is unable to meet the exceptions  to  deportation
       in the  Immigration  Rules  as  he  cannot  meet  the  private  life
       exception as he has not been lawfully resident, and he  cannot  meet
       the family life exception because likewise he cannot show  that  his
       relationship was formed when he was in the UK lawfully. As  such  it
       is properly concluded that the only question under  the  deportation
       Immigration Rules remaining was whether there  are  very  compelling
       circumstances over and above those exceptions  to  deportation  that
       mean the appellant should not be deported.

   16.  As  Ms  Daykin  has  identified  the  First-tier  Tribunal  wrongly
       conducts  a  separate  Article  8  ECHR  exercise  outside  of   the
       Immigration Rules after concluding that  there  were  no  compelling
       compassionate circumstances. I do not find that  this  alone  was  a
       material error. The only potential for this being a  material  error
       is if the correct exercise, the proportionality exercise looking for
       very compelling circumstances was wrongly conducted in any way, so I
       now turn to this exercise.

   17. I find that the approach adopted by the First-tier Tribunal  to  the
       very compelling circumstances test does however err in law  for  the
       following reasons. As argued by Ms Daykin each element of  the  case
       is examined  and  then  in  the  final  sentence  of  the  paragraph
       concluding consideration of that element (namely paragraphs 26,  27,
       35 and 36) it is concluded that it does not amount to  a  compelling
       circumstances. I do not find that the single sentence  at  paragraph
       38 suffices to show that there was a cumulative assessment of  these
       facts as it could simply be  saying  that  each  of  the  individual
       assessments failed to reach the necessary standard of compellingness
       and so the appeal failed.  There was therefore a failure to consider
       the elements cumulatively, and further I find that there was also  a
       failure to include elements found in the appellant's favour  in  the
       separate Article 8 ECHR exercise, namely the fact that his  sentence
       is at the lower end of the continuum, that there were no aggravating
       features to his criminal behaviour and the fact that  the  appellant
       accepted his guilt.

   18. I find that the rejection of the letter  from  Think  Action,  which
       states that the appellant has PTSD and depression, at  paragraph  27
       of the decision is insufficiently reasoned.  Mr  Clarke  has  raised
       legitimate issues with the letter which could have been reasons  not
       to give it weight, but these are not set out in the decision. Alone,
       however, it would not suffice to show a material error of law in the
       context of the high legal test which this appellant has to meet.

   19.  The  appellant's  wife's  medical   letters   from   her   treating
       haematologist Dr Evans are evidence that she  has  a  chronic  blood
       disorder, namely immune thrombocytopenia  purpura,  which  means  in
       simple terms that her white blood cells attack her blood  platelets.
       She has had relapses in the past, but at the  current  time  she  is
       drug free due to having endured cycles of drug treatment including a
       form of chemotherapy which she undertook to enable herself to try to
       have a baby. The First-tier Tribunal  concludes at paragraph  34  of
       the decision that the it is accepted that she has  this  conditions,
       and that the drugs she might need in case of a relapse would not  be
       available in Albania, but finds that in this circumstance (which  is
       confusing  described  as  both  unforeseen  and  one   which   might
       reasonably arise in the context of her condition) she could obtain a
       return flight to the UK for treatment as a British citizen.  As  the
       medical evidence  includes  details  that  in  the  past,  when  the
       condition  reoccurred,  of  the  appellant's  wife  needing   urgent
       admission to hospital and the possibility of her bleeding  to  death
       without treatment, and it is not  entirely  straightforward  that  a
       British citizen who has made her permanent home in  another  country
       can return for free NHS treatment, I find that this  conclusion  was
       irrational and insufficiently reasoned.

   20. Whilst appreciating  the  force  of  Mr  Clarke's  submissions  with
       respect to the high test to be applied to this appellant I find that
       it cannot be said that the  errors  of  law  above  when  considered
       cumulatively are immaterial. There is a possibility, even if  it  is
       not a very strong one, that the medical condition of the appellant's
       spouse when considered in the round with the offending being at  the
       lower end and other factors in the  appellant's  favour  might  lead
       another Tribunal to allow the appellant's  appeal,  although  a  new
       Tribunal would have to consider not only whether it  would  be  over
       and above unduly harsh for the appellant and his spouse to  live  in
       Albania but also whether it would be unduly harsh for her to  remain
       in the UK without him  which  this  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to
       consider.  I therefore conclude that the errors of law are  material
       and so set aside the decision and all of the findings of the  First-
       tier Tribunal.

   21. As I find that this appeal will  not  involve  very  extensive  fact
       finding I retain the remaking in the Upper Tribunal. It  was  agreed
       by the appellant and his wife that  the  remaking  would  best  take
       place via a remote Skype for Business hearing, particularly  as  his
       wife has recently given birth to a  baby  and  now  has  to  undergo
       further medical treatment which will affect her immune system and so
       will need to isolate completely, and so it would be best for them to
       join a remote hearing using their own laptop computer from home  for
       the remaking hearing. It was agreed  that  the  remaking  should  be
       listed for the first available date after 10 weeks allowing for  the
       appellant's wife to have her treatment and recover somewhat from it.
       The appellant confirmed that he did not need an interpreter for  the
       remaking hearing.



          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
      appeal and all of the findings.

   3. I adjourn the re-making of the appeal.


   Directions

        i)  The  remaking  hearing  will  consist  of  evidence  from   the
           appellant, his wife  and  submissions  in  a  remote  Skype  for
           Business hearing.

       ii) Any further documentary evidence relied upon should be filed and
           served ten days prior to the remaking hearing.

      iii) The time estimate is 3 hours.


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings. I do so to protect the privacy of his wife in relation  to  her
medical condition.
