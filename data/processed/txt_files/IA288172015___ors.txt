                                                                 Respondents

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Miss E savage, Home Office Presenting Officer
The Respondents did not appear and were not represented.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal where the lead respondent is  Nasimul  Hasan  but  it
    also concerns his wife, Nafisa Ali and their two male children, NY  and
    HY.  I do not need to go into any of  the  background  to  this  matter
    because it has  been  resolved  and  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is no longer challenged. I am  grateful  to  Miss  Savage  for
    corresponding with the  Tribunal  yesterday,  setting  out  with  great
    clarity what  is  to  be  done.   In  consequence  of  her  letter  the
    respondents were given permission not to attend but the  outcome  needs
    to be recorded and my approval given for the proposed disposal.

2.   In accordance with Rule 17A of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules  2008  Mr  Nasimul  Hasan  (IA/28817/2014)  and  Ms  Nafisa   Ali
    (IA/28830/2014) have been granted indefinite leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom and in those  circumstances  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeals are treated as abandoned pursuant to  Section  104(4A)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

3.   Further, in accordance  with  Rule  17  of  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008, the Secretary of State has formally given  notice
    of the withdrawal of her appeals in respect of NY  (IA/28839/2014)  and
    HY (IA/28810/2014).

4.   In the circumstances,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    stand.

Notice of Decision

Appeals abandoned. Decision of First-tier Tribunal affirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
