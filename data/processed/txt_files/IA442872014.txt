For the Respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State becomes the appellant.
     However, for the sake of consistency and to avoid confusion,  I  shall
    continue to refer to the parties as they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 2. On 20th October 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  N  Osborne  gave
    permission to the respondent to appeal against the decision of Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Narayan who  allowed  the  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent taken on 16th October 2014, to refuse  leave
    to remain on the grounds of ten  years'  long  residence  applying  the
    provisions of paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the Immigration Rules.

 3.  Judge  Osborne  noted  that,  in  accordance  with  the   grounds   of
    application, there were two issues. First, that the  appellant  had  no
    leave to remain from 17th April 2012 (when an application for leave  to
    remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant had been refused)  to  6th
    November 2012 when the appellant was again granted leave as  a  student
    until 30th January 2014.  Second, it was  argued  that  the  judge  had
    miscalculated the period of 28 days' grace given by  paragraph  276B(v)
    of the Rules.

Submissions

 4. Ms Johnstone relied upon the grounds as  summarised  in  the  grant  of
    permission.  In detail these argue that paragraph 276A(b) of the  Rules
    define "lawful residence" as including residence "pursuant to  existing
    leave to enter or remain".  Whilst provision is made for  leave  to  be
    statutorily extended pending  the  outcome  of  an  application  lodged
    before leave expires there is no such provision for an application made
    after leave expires.   Thus  the  entire  period  from  the  expiry  of
    previous leave (extended by Section 3C of the 1971 Act) until the  date
    on which new leave was granted falls outside the definition of  "lawful
    residence".  The application for leave on the basis of  long  residence
    made on 1st June 2012 had no effect in terms of the appellant having no
    leave at the time of that application.

 5. The second point made in the grounds argues that  the  wording  of  the
    concession in paragraph 276B(v) requires that an applicant must not  be
    in the UK in breach of immigration laws and applies the  present  tense
    and does not mean must not have been.  Thus, the respondent argues that
    only a current period of less than 28 days is to be  disregarded.   The
    combined effect of the two grounds is said to mean that the  First-tier
    Judge miscalculated the relevant periods of time without leave in  2012
    and then wrongly applied its conclusions to paragraph 276B(v).

 6. Ms Johnstone added to the grounds by indicating  that  the  appellant's
    skeleton argument (to which I refer later) now stated that the relevant
    date for calculation of the 28 day period from  the  decision  of  20th
    April 2012 was 25th April 2012 which was not the date put to the judge.
     She maintained that the appellant  had  no  leave  from  the  date  of
    decision on 20th April 2012 to the grant of further leave as a  student
    on 6th November 2012.  She also argued that, if the appellant  had  not
    appealed within ten days of 20th April 2012, the 28 day period of grace
    granted by Section 3C(2)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971 would not apply
    as this related to an extension of time in relation to the bringing  of
    an appeal when the appellant had not, in fact, appealed that  decision.
    Further, she confirmed it was the respondent's view that, in any event,
    the gap between 20th April and the application on  1st  June  was  more
    than 28 days and the appellant was not entitled to add another ten days
    for an appeal that he did not bring.

 7. Mr Shah commenced his submissions on the basis  that,  at  the  hearing
    before  the  First-tier  Judge,  the  Home  Office  representative  had
    accepted the relevant date as 25th April 2012 although, I as  indicated
    to him, there was no indication that this was so.  Indeed, paragraph 21
    of the decision shows that Mr Shah put to the judge at  the  time  that
    25th April 2012 was a bank holiday when it was not (such holiday  being
    on 23rd April 2012).  At paragraph 22 the judge records that  the  Home
    Office Presenting  Officer  at  the  time,  Mrs  Boden,  accepted  "the
    arithmetic" only if Mr Shah's argument in respect  of  Section  3C  was
    correct.  Mr Shah continued to rely upon his grounds the relevant  part
    of which I quote as follows:

         "Submissions

          1. The appellant submits his application was in time and  he  did
             not overstay the designated time limits set by the Immigration
             Rules.

          2. The appellant submits on 31/01/2012 to  20/04/2012  his  leave
             was pending under 3C leave of the Immigration Act 1971.

          3.  The  appellant  submits  the  decision  on   the   31/01/2012
             application was  made  by  the  SSHD  on  20/04/2012  and  not
             17/04/2012 this is confirmed by the Case Record sheet  in  the
             Outcome action section.

          4. The appellant submits the decision  was  received  by  him  on
             25/04/2015.

          5. The appellant wishes to rely on  Immigration  Rules  Paragraph
             276B(v) and The Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)
             Rules 2005, the following calculation of the dates  and  times
             are as followed;

         The appellant Lodged an application on 31/01/2012 the appellant did
         not receive a reply back from the Home Office until 25/04/2012.

             Application sent to Home Office -   31/01/2012

                        To  (Appellant   has   not   overstayed   Rule   3C
                                             Immigration Act 1971)

             Decision served on the appellant -  25/04/2012

             10 day Limit to lodge appeal -  26/04/2012

                        To (The Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)
                                             Rules 2005 Rule 7)

             Last day to Lodge appeal - 09/05/2012

         On 07/05/2012 there  was  a  public  Holiday  namely  Bank  Holiday
         Monday, therefore one day will need to be added  from  the  10  Day
         limit therefore making 10/05/2012 the last day for the appellant to
         lodge his appeal, the appellant submits he was  under  no  duty  to
         lodge an appeal as Immigration Act 1971 section 3C(2)(b) states  an
         appeal under section 81(1)  of  the  Nationality  Act,  Asylum  and
         Immigration Act 2002 Could be brought, while the  appellant  is  in
         the United Kingdom against the  decision  on  the  application  for
         variation (ignoring any possibility of an appeal out of  time  with
         permission).  The appellant wishes to rely on  the  word  could  be
         brought, the appellant is under no duty to appeal the said decision
         and there is no immigration rule that can scrutinize the  appellant
         for his decision.

             28 days overstayed allowed -    10/05/2012

                        To (Paragraph 276B(V) of the Immigration rules)

             Last day Before the 28 day Rule -   06/06/2012

          6. The Appellant  on  01/06/2012  decided  to  submit  a  Tier  3
             (General) Student Visa, well before 06/06/2012 being the  last
             day of  his  lawful  leave  under  Paragraph  276B(v)  of  the
             Immigration rules.  The submission  of  this  application  was
             accepted by the Home Office which is shown on the Case  record
             sheet on the Outcome Action."

Conclusions

 8. I have reached the conclusion that the decision of the First-tier Judge
    does not show an error on a point of law for the reasons which follow.

 9. The judge conducts a careful analysis of the law  and  the  Immigration
    Rules from paragraph 27 onwards.

10. It was accepted that the decision relating to the  application  for  an
    extension of student leave submitted by the appellant on  31st  January
    2012 was refused on  20th  April  2012  (the  date  on  the  letter  of
    refusal).  Although the judge does not deal with the  submission  about
    the date of receipt of that decision (which is stated, erroneously,  in
    the skeleton to have been 25th April 2015) that makes no difference  to
    the overall calculation made by the judge.

11.  I infer that the date in the skeleton should be 25th April 2012 and is
    simply a clerical error.  But, as I have said, that makes no difference
    to the overall calculation which eliminates any period of  overstaying.
    That is because, as detailed in  the  skeleton,  the  appellant  had  a
    period of ten working days (calculated within Rule 7 of the Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005) in  which  he  could  have
    brought his appeal. That period is not to be regarded as overstaying by
    virtue of Section 3C(2) of the Immigration Act 1971  and  runs  to,  at
    least, 3rd of May 2012 applying the Procedure Rules.

12. Then, applying the 28 day period of grace allowed by paragraph  276B(v)
    of the Rules takes the period to 1st June  2012  when  the  appellant's
    subsequent application was made.  For the avoidance of doubt,  however,
    I should point out that the decision which is  dated  20th  April  2012
    cannot have reached the appellant through the post until at  least  the
    following  day.  By  operation  of  Rule  7(1)(a)  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (which  was  applicable  at
    the time) time to appeal runs when the appellant  is  served  with  the
    notice of decision. So, the operative date adding the 28 day concession
    under 276B(v) was, at least, 2 June 2012, the day after  the  appellant
    made his application for leave which was approved. Any failure  by  the
    judge to deal with the claimed date of receipt of the relevant decision
    on 25 April 2012 is not material as the extension granted by Section 3C
    (after applying the Procedure Rules for service) would still mean  that
    the appellant was entitled to take the benefit of the 28 day period  of
    grace in paragraph 276B(v) of the Immigration Rules applicable at  that
    time which would take him past the date of application on 1 June  2012.



13. In reaching the above conclusions I should make it clear that I  regard
    the words "could be brought" in Section 3C(2)(b) of the 1971 Act as not
    requiring an appeal to, actually, be brought. That is  because  of  the
    ordinary meaning of the words "could be". The  words  do  not  imply  a
    requirement to bring the appeal only that it can be brought.

14. Thus, the judge was entitled to reach the conclusion that  the  refusal
    decision of the respondent of 20th April 2012 was wrong  and  that  the
    appellant is entitled to leave  on  the  basis  of  ten  years'  lawful
    residence.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not show an error  on  a  point
of law and shall stand.

Anonymity

Anonymity was not requested before the First-tier  Tribunal  nor  the  Upper
Tribunal nor do I consider it appropriate in this appeal.
