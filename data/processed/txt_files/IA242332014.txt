Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Livingstone
                    Brown, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant  appeals  against  a  determination,  promulgated  on  24
    November 2014,  by  a  panel  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  comprising
    Designated Judge Murray and Judge Watt.

 2. After hearing  from  both  parties,  I  was  satisfied  that  ground  3
    identifies material error of law on the basis of Chikwamba [2008] 1 WLR
    1420 and MA (Pakistan) [2010] Imm AR 196.

 3. The panel found as fact that the appellant had the option of  returning
    to India to make an application to  return  as  the  fiancï¿½e  or  as  a
    spouse.  The panel recognised that might be inconvenient and would cost
    money, but thought that it would  not  be  unduly  harsh,  because  the
    parties would be apart only  temporarily.   They  decided  against  the
    appellant on the basis that there were no compassionate  or  compelling
    circumstances and no good reason to go outside the Rules.

 4. Unfortunately,  the  panel  in  its  analysis  confused  the  tests  of
    insurmountable obstacles and compassionate and compelling circumstances
    with the principle in Chikwamba, which is that a person should  not  be
    required to submit to the formality of applying from abroad  without  a
    good reason, such as a bad immigration history.

 5. The respondent's Rule 24 response to the grant  of  permission  submits
    that Chikwamba does not apply since amendment of the Immigration  Rules
    in 2012 and the introduction of section 117A to D of the 2014 Act,  but
    it does not develop that argument or refer to  any  further  authority.
    Nor did Mrs O'Brien do so in her submissions.  So far as  I  am  aware,
    there is no case law to suggest that the Chikwamba principle  does  not
    remain good, and tribunals continue to apply it.

 6. The appellant does not have a bad immigration  history.   The  test  in
    Chikwamba is not a high one.  An Entry Clearance Officer  would  be  no
    better placed to examine the issue - indeed, the panel decided the case
    on the basis that the appellant would succeed  under  the  Rules.   The
    panel identified  no  adequate  reason  why  the  appellant  should  be
    required to apply  from  India.   This  decision  should  therefore  be
    reversed.

 7. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  The appeal,
    as originally brought to the  First-tier  Tribunal,  is  allowed  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

 8. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
