                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the appellant against a  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Bradshaw ("the judge"), promulgated on  31  March  2015.
    The Judge found that a deportation order made by the respondent  on  11
    January 2011 was not made in accordance with  the  law  and  should  be
    revoked and then went on to dismiss the appeal on immigration and  ECHR
    grounds.





Background

2.    The appellant is a national of Nigeria who was born on 6  April  1987.
    On 17 December 2013, the respondent refused the appellant's application
    for a residence card as confirmation of his right to reside in  the  UK
    as the family member of an EEA national  exercising  treaty  rights  of
    movement in the UK. The respondent relied on Regulation  20(1)  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. The respondent  narrated  that  the
    appellant received a custodial sentence totalling 12  months  following
    conviction in the criminal courts on 13 October 2010.

3.    On 11 January 2011, the appellant was served with a deportation  order
    made under Section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971. The deportation
    order was made because the respondent decided that the appellant was "a
    foreign criminal" as defined by Section 32(1) of  the  UK  Borders  Act
    2007. The appellant appealed against  that  decision.  His  appeal  was
    heard in Glasgow on 27 February 2014 and in a determination promulgated
    on 25 March  2014,  his  appeal  was  dismissed  on  all  grounds.  The
    appellant appealed against that decision and in a determination of  the
    Upper  Tribunal  promulgated  on  9  September  2014,  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal's decision promulgated on 25 March 2014 was set aside and  the
    case was remitted to the Secretary of State to  consider  of  new.  The
    Upper Tribunal found that the Secretary of State had failed to  make  a
    decision on whether the deportation order served  on  11  January  2011
    should be revoked before considering whether or not  the  appellant  is
    entitled to a residence card.

4.    On  12  January  2015,  the  respondent  decided  not  to  revoke  the
    deportation order served on 11 January 2011.

5.    The appellant appealed the respondent's decision of 12  January  2015.
    His appeal was heard by First Tier Tribunal Judge Bradshaw on 13  March
    2015. In a determination promulgated on 31 March 2015, the Judge  found
    that the deportation order made by  the  respondent  was  not  made  in
    accordance with the law and should be revoked, but dismissed the appeal
    on immigration and ECHR grounds.

6.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and, on 22 April 2015, Designated  First
    Tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy granted permission to appeal, finding that
    each of the  five  areas  identified  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  are
    arguable. Those areas are:

         (1)      The misapplication of the principle set out in  Devaseelan
         [2002]  UKIAT  00702,  by  adopting  findings   from   an   earlier
         determination that had been set aside;

         (2)      The  misapplication  of  the  transitional  provisions  of
         Paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 3 of the Immigration  (EEA)  (Amendment)
         (No. 2) Regulations 2013;

         (3)      The misapplication of the principle set out in SSHD v
         Akrich (ECJ) Case C-109/01 [2004] 2WLR 871

         (4)      The  misapplication  of  Regulation  9  of  the  2006  EEA
         Regulations by taking account of  the  short  period  of  time  the
         appellant's British wife worked in Germany; and

         (5)      The misapplication of Article 8 ECHR (a failure  to  carry
         out a proper balancing exercise of all relevant factors,  statutory
         and otherwise).

The Hearing

7.    At the very start of the hearing, the Home Office  presenting  officer
    conceded that there is sufficient set out in the grounds of  appeal  to
    come to a set aside decision  in  relation  to  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 and the "Devaseelan point" and asked us to direct  the
    Secretary of State to consider this  application  of  new,  recognising
    that the deportation order has been correctly revoked.

8.    Mr Decker, a friend of  the  appellant,  has  assisted  the  appellant
    throughout these proceedings. He took us to the terms of the grounds of
    appeal and reminded us that the issue of a residence card is  a  matter
    for the Secretary of State's discretion. Mr Decker  relied  on  Section
    86(3) of the 2002 Act and urged us to review the Secretary  of  State's
    exercise of discretion in this case.

Consideration

9.    We find that the judge was correct in his analysis and conclusions  in
    relation to the legality of the deportation  order  made  against  this
    appellant. Between [67] and [71], the judge correctly  found  that  the
    deportation order was made because  the  respondent  decided  that  the
    appellant was "a foreign criminal" as defined  by  s.32(1)  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007. As a matter of fact, the appellant had been sentenced
    to two consecutive six month periods in custody,  so  that  his  was  a
    custodial sentence totalling 12 months. It was  not  a  sentence  which
    amounted "...in aggregate to more than  12  months".  The  decision  to
    revoke the deportation order does not contain an error in law and there
    is no challenge to that.

10.   It is correctly conceded that the judge erred in law at  [73]  of  his
    decision because he placed reliance on the conclusions  of  an  earlier
    determination which had been set aside by the Upper Tribunal, and  then
    relied on those findings (which had been set aside) as a  part  of  his
    reasoning. That is the first ground of appeal for the appellant.  There
    is substance in that  ground  of  appeal;  we  find  that  because  the
    principle set out in  Devaseelan  has  been  incorrectly  applied,  the
    decision cannot stand. We therefore set it aside.

11.   Having done so, we find that the  Secretary  of  State  still  has  to
    decide, in accordance with the law, the appellant's application  for  a
    residence card (applying the discretion contained in Regulation  21  of
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006) taking account of her powers in
    relation  to  deportation  set  against  the   particular   facts   and
    circumstances pertaining to the appellant.

Decision

12.   We find that the determination of First Tier Tribunal  Judge  Bradshaw
    promulgated on 31 March 2015 contains  a  material  error  of  law.  We
    therefore set the decision aside. We substitute the following decision.

13.   The appeal is allowed. The application remains outstanding and  awaits
    a lawful decision by the Secretary of State.
