                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  Court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly. This order applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure
to comply with this order could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

Decision and reasons

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's refusal to
    grant him international protection, either as a refugee or  by  way  of
    humanitarian protection, or leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Albania born in May 1998. The appellant's
    claim for asylum was made in March 2014, when he was  a  child  of  15.
    The appellant came to the United Kingdom in 2013, having travelled from
    his home in Durres, Albania via France and Italy, on his own passport.

 3. In a decision sent to the parties on 7 February 2017, I set  aside  the
    decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  ordered  that  the  appeal
    decision be remade in the Upper Tribunal on a date to  be  fixed.   The
    appeal was adjourned on 3 April 2017, and again on 16  June  2017.   It
    comes before me for substantive hearing today, to remake  the  decision
    on the facts as they are now.

 4. In making this decision, and at the hearing, I have had regard  to  the
    guidance on children  and  vulnerable  adults,  both  from  the  Senior
    President of Tribunals in 2008, and from the Presidents  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal and First-tier Tribunal in 2010 in Joint Presidential Guidance
    Note No 2 of 2010: Child,  vulnerable  adult  and  sensitive  appellant
    guidance.  The appellant's evidence was taken by the respondent when he
    was a child, as was his witness statement.

 5. The appellant has had, but did not take, the  opportunity  to  file  an
    updated witness statement.  He is still only 19 but he has been legally
    represented throughout.  No submissions  were  made  today  as  to  any
    required adjustment for his young age  during  his  evidence,  and  his
    representative made no complaint of the manner in which the appellant's
    brief cross-examination had been conducted.

Background

 6. The appellant's account in his asylum statement on 4 March 2014 is that
    he and his family are ethnic Albanians from Berat,  and  all  are  non-
    practising Muslims.  The appellant's parents and extended family  still
    live in his home area in Albania, including his  younger  brother.   He
    has a paternal grandmother, two paternal uncles and one  paternal  aunt
    there. Another paternal aunt  lives  in  the  United  States.  All  his
    paternal relatives are  married  and  all  of  those  in  Albania  have
    children.  The appellant has a maternal  grandmother  and  grandfather,
    another two uncles and two aunts.  One of his aunts  lives  in  Greece,
    with her husband and four children.   All  the  rest  of  his  maternal
    relatives live in Albania with their spouses and all have children.

 7. The appellant's parents both worked, his  mother  as  a  tailor,  in  a
    factory and at home, and his father  as  a  builder.   The  appellant's
    father was a heavy drinker, and eventually could find  no  construction
    work.  He became an alcoholic, and was violent to  the  appellant,  his
    mother and his  sibling.   The  appellant's  schooling  suffered.   His
    mother was extremely frightened of his father.  He told the family that
    if they left him, he would find them  and  kill  them.    The  mother's
    complaints to her brothers made things worse, as the father  threatened
    them and told them to stay away.  He beat the  appellant's  mother  for
    seeking help.  The appellant himself was too frightened to confront his
    father, and to his knowledge, his mother did  not  ask  the  police  to
    help, again because she was afraid.

 8. In 2012/2013, the appellant's father began  to  gamble  and  to  borrow
    money  which  he  could  not  pay  back.   The  appellant's  previously
    excellent schoolwork began to suffer.  He had to stay home  because  of
    bruising, and when he asked his teachers for help, they failed to  take
    action.

 9. This part of the appellant's account is accepted by the respondent.

The abductions

10. The appellant's account was that  when  his  money  ran  out,  and  the
    earnings of the appellant and his mother were insufficient, his  father
    borrowed from criminal gangs.  In June  2013,  the  appellant's  father
    found employment for the appellant, as a waiter in a bar/caf�, and took
    the appellant's earnings to help pay for his gambling, as well  as  the
    mother's earnings from her tailoring work.

11. The appellant says that in August 2013, he was abducted and detained by
    criminal gang members, to try to force his father to pay the  debts  he
    owed.  He was picked up while returning from work,  not  far  from  the
    family home, his hands and mouth gaffer taped, and he was driven in the
    car to a room in the ground floor  of  a  building.   There,  the  gang
    members took the tape off the appellant's mouth, telephoned his father,
    and put him on the telephone to his father,  then  took  the  telephone
    away and spoke to his father in  the  next  room,  swearing,  demanding
    their money, and threatening to kill the appellant if  his  father  did
    not pay what was owed.

12. The appellant was released after about 2 hours, threatened  with  death
    if he mentioned the abduction, and thrown out of the car about  300-400
    metres from home.  When the appellant got home, his mother was  unaware
    what had happened.  His father did not tell his mother, but he beat her
    when she asked him about the abduction.

13. His father told the appellant not to cry, to say nothing, and  that  he
    would pay back the debts.  The appellant's  father  said  that  if  the
    family went to the police, the gang members would come  and  kill  them
    all.  The appellant was reluctant to return to his bar job,  afraid  to
    leave the house, but his father insisted, beating the appellant when he
    refused.  The appellant returned to work.

14. A week later, the same gang approached the appellant's  mother  outside
    the house and threatened to take the appellant away and  kill  him,  if
    the debt remained unpaid.  His mother told his father, who  refused  to
    let her go to the police.  The appellant went on going  to  work.   His
    father came home bruised at times and the  appellant  thinks  the  gang
    were also threatening him directly.

15. On 16 October 2013, the appellant was abducted again by members of  the
    same gang.  He recognised two of those who had previously abducted him.
     This time, he was detained and ill-treated overnight, being threatened
    with a gun, punched, and slapped on the face.   The gang  members  said
    that this time he would not be released:  he would  have  to  work  for
    them, or he would be killed and his family would be harmed.

16. The appellant escaped, broke a window, and went to  a  friend's  house,
    too afraid to go home. He telephoned his  mother,  who  came  with  his
    genuine Albanian passport and money to leave the country (about E700 or
    �626), which she borrowed from her relatives. The respondent  does  not
    accept that part  of  the  account,  save  for  the  domestic  violence
    element.

Travel to the United Kingdom

17. The appellant travelled openly from Tirana airport to France via Italy,
    for which he did not need a visa, as both Italy and Albania are in  the
    Schengen zone.  He bought a return ticket to  France  via  Italy  (Rome
    Fiumicino).  After checking in, he had to  bribe  an  airport  official
    20,000 Lek (about �133) to let him travel alone, as he was a child.  In
    France, he met a group of other Albanians, and travelled on with  them,
    arriving in the United Kingdom clandestinely in a lorry on  28  October
    2013.  He escaped from the lorry and  was  picked  up  by  the  police,
    walking on the motorway.   He  was  referred  to  Social  Services  and
    claimed asylum on 23 December 2013.

Refusal letter

18. In her refusal letter, the respondent erroneously at [14]  referred  to
    the appellant not having advanced any fear of the Turkish  authorities.
    That is clearly an error, as the rest of the letter refers to  Albania.
    She accepted the appellant's age  and  identity,  and  that  he  is  an
    Albanian citizen, as his passport confirmed.   She made allowances  for
    the appellant's age, but disbelieved his account.

19. The refusal  letter  set  out  the  unaccompanied  minor  policies  for
    Alitalia and Blue Panorama airlines, the only airlines which  fly  from
    Tirana  to  Paris  via  Rome  Fiumicino.   Alitalia   has   a   special
    unaccompanied minor service: the  minor  must  be  accompanied  at  the
    airport, and until airborne; there is an additional charge  of  E40-75,
    and for those age 15-17, the service must be pre-booked.   The  airline
    will check with the Embassy  of  the  country  of  nationality.    Blue
    Panorama permits a maximum of 2 children per flight under  the  age  of
    14, travelling as unaccompanied minors. It is necessary to contact  the
    airline's call centre at least 72 hours before departure.  (There is no
    suggestion that there are any rules for persons  over  14  years  old).
    The respondent disbelieved the appellant's account of his journey.

20. The appellant had not cooperated with the family tracing  efforts  made
    by the respondent, in that he had not provided a  specific  address  or
    contact details for his parents in Albania.   However,  the  respondent
    had checked the appellant's family details via the British  Embassy  in
    Tirana, and  a  letter  from  the  Embassy  confirmed  the  appellant's
    personal and family details.  No evidence of family  members  had  been
    traced to the United Kingdom or other overseas  immigration  databases.
    The appellant had a Facebook and Google+ profile.  The respondent  gave
    details of further tracing opportunities through the British Red Cross,
    and of the voluntary return programme run by Refugee Action.   Applying
    KA (Afghanistan) & Ors v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2012] EWCA Civ 1014, the respondent considered that she  had  met  her
    family tracing obligation, and relying on EU (Afghanistan) and others v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  32,  the
    respondent regarded the fact that the appellant's mother had  paid  for
    him to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom  as  indicative  of  his  having
    maintained contact with his family thereafter.

21. Turning to internal relocation, and  after  setting  out  the  relevant
    legal principles, the respondent considered that 'there  are  parts  of
    Albania [unspecified] in which you do not have a well-founded  fear  of
    persecution and to which it would be reasonable and not unduly harsh to
    expect you to go; for example to another area within the  urban  sprawl
    of the capital city Tirana; or to live with any of your relatives  such
    as aunts, uncles, or grandparents'.

22. The appellant had not advanced or established any fear of state  agents
    in Albania and the  respondent  concluded  that  'you  have  failed  to
    establish the police in Albania would be completely unwilling or unable
    to offer you assistance and protection'.  The  humanitarian  protection
    and human rights claims also failed.

23. The respondent considered that it would be in the  appellant's  section
    55 best interests to return to Albania, that he would be able  to  make
    contact with family members in advance, to arrange a  parental  escort,
    and that his first language was Albanian as was part of his schooling.

24. The appeal was dismissed.

First-tier Tribunal decision

25. The appellant's first appeal decision before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Mackenzie was the subject of an appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.   On  23
    February 2016, the appeal was remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  for
    rehearing afresh.  The appeal was then  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Oliver in August 2016.  The Judge's  decision  was  sent  to  the
    parties on 15 September 2016.  I have set aside that decision  and  now
    remake it.

Upper Tribunal hearing

26. At the hearing on 14 November 2011, the appellant gave  oral  evidence,
    adopting his witness statement of 20 August 2015, which  had  not  been
    updated  or  supplemented.   He  confirmed  his  new  home  address  in
    Hounslow, London.

27. The original witness statement set out the appellant's evidence  as  at
    20 August 2015, when he would have been 17 years old.  It asserted that
    the appellant was a credible witness  and  a  member  of  a  particular
    social group (a child who was a victim of domestic violence)  and  that
    he was concerned that the refusal letter referred  to  a  fear  of  the
    Turkish, not the  Albanian  authorities.   He  sought  to  correct  his
    account of the age at which a child could work in Albania: he now  said
    that he had always believed it to be 18, and  that  no  other  children
    worked in the same place as he did.  He considered that given his  age,
    he should have been given the benefit of the doubt in this respect.

28. The appellant said that the purpose of the screening interview was  not
    for him to give all the information about his substantive claim: during
    his screening interview, he  was  told  'to  keep  any  account  of  my
    problems in Albania  short...I  would  have  an  opportunity  later  to
    provide a more detailed account'.  He said that although airlines  have
    a specific procedure for unaccompanied  minors,  that  was  not  always
    adhered to in practice.  At [7], the statement continues:

         "7.  ... After I arrived at the airport, I approached a person  and
         asked where I could buy tickets to travel to France and  he  showed
         me the desk.  I approached the desk  and  brought  [sic]  a  ticket
         using my passport and my age was not queried.  I  then  checked  in
         and was given  a  boarding  pass.   I  then  went  through  luggage
         security and later met a female Albanian  immigration  officer  and
         she checked my documents and told me that  I  was  not  allowed  to
         travel because of my age.  I then handed over to  her  an  envelope
         which contained 20,000 Lek [about �133] and she allowed me to  pass
         and I later boarded the plane."

29. The witness statement  says  that  there  were  no  adequate  reception
    arrangements in Albania and he should have been  granted  discretionary
    leave to remain.  He had no contact with his family  and  had  made  no
    effort to contact them, 'mainly because of fear from  my  father'.   If
    relocated to another part of Albania, his father and the  gang  members
    would  find  him:   Albania  was  a  small  country  and  taking   into
    consideration his age, and his lack of contact with his own family,  it
    would not be difficult for his father or the gang members to find  him.
    The appellant maintained that the police in Albania  were  corrupt  and
    lacked the necessary resources:  they  would  not  become  involved  in
    domestic issues and he would not  be  given  sufficient  protection  on
    return.   The appellant asked that his appeal be allowed.

30. The appellant gave no further evidence in chief and  was  tendered  for
    cross-examination.  In  cross-examination,  he  confirmed  having  left
    Albania in October 2013 but stated that he had no  contact  since  then
    with his mother, brother, or other family there.    He  confirmed  that
    his mother had paid for him to leave Albania,  but  said  that  he  was
    scared and afraid of letting her know he  was  safe,  as  probably  his
    father would then have an idea about him.  If  the  appellant's  father
    came to know where he was now, he would have a lot  of  problems.   The
    appellant's mother had not asked him to let her  know  where  he  went,
    when she gave him the money to leave Albania. She  had  not  previously
    offered him money to do so: it was fear of the gangs which  caused  his
    mother to find the money for him to leave.

31. The appellant confirmed that he continued to rely on his abductions  by
    the criminal gang as the reason he left Albania.  Asked to explain  why
    he had not mentioned this aspect of his claim on entry,  the  appellant
    asked for the question to be repeated, then said he  that  he  probably
    had not understood.  He did not have  a  solicitor  for  the  screening
    interview.  Someone from the Home Office that day had suggested to  the
    appellant that he just answer questions in a simple way, telling him to
    say 'not so much', just to say small things. That was why,  when  asked
    if he had any other fears if returned to Albania, apart  from  domestic
    violence by his father, he had said that there were none.

32. Asked why, in his first witness statement, the appellant said that  the
    gang members came to his house, he said that was incorrect.  His mother
    had left her job, and they had caught up with her away from the  house,
    but not far: the gang did know where they lived.  He was unsure whether
    they knew he had a brother.

33. The appellant had worked from June - September 2013 as a waiter, during
    the summer break.  When the gang picked him up, he was  still  working:
    in holiday time, he worked every day, and when at school, he worked  at
    the weekends.  The place where he worked was about 5 minutes' walk from
    his home, but the gang never came to his place of work.

34. As regards the appellant's journey to the United Kingdom, the appellant
    was asked whether he been asked any questions about  his  age  when  he
    went to the airport to buy a ticket.  He was 15, and travelling  alone.
    This part of his evidence was difficult to clarify: the question had to
    be repeated several times.  The appellant said he told them that he was
    travelling alone, and wanted a ticket to go to France.   He  said  that
    they told them he could not travel at that  age,  and  that  he  needed
    someone with him.  the appellant said, 'I was like, give me  a  ticket'
    and apparently  they  did,  because  he  showed  his  passport  to  the
    immigration officer when boarding the plane.  He then said that he  was
    not asked who was travelling with him, when he bought the ticket.  This
    part of the evidence did not strike me as reliable, to any standard.

35. The appellant said that on arrival in France, he did not seek  to  stay
    there as he was aware that he could not  get  asylum  in  France.   His
    understanding was that you would be returned home, if found in  France.
    He could not travel there with a visa, and  feared  they  would  return
    him.

36. There was no re-examination.

Evidence of Sonya Landesmann

37. Ms Sonya Landesmann, BA (Hons), Dip. Intercultural Psychotherapy,  UKCP
    registered, prepared a country expert report. She had  before  her  all
    relevant documents in the appeal, including  the  refusal  letter,  the
    British Embassy  letter,  and  the  appellant's  statements,  interview
    records.  Ms Landesmann set out her duties to the Court at section 3 of
    the report, and her statement of truth at section 4 is  Ikarian  Reefer
    compliant.  The witness was not called to give evidence.

38. Ms Landesmann describes  herself  as  an  intercultural  psychoanalytic
    psychotherapist who has specialist training in how mental and emotional
    distress may be expressed by people from other cultures. She  also  has
    professional qualifications in teaching English to  adult  speakers  of
    other languages.  TEFL teaching in London in the 1980 and 1990s brought
    her into contact with people from  around  the  world,  principally  in
    Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria.  The witness  has  lived  and  worked  in
    Sudan in 1983 and in Mozambique for 2 year thereafter.  She has visited
    southeast Turkey to observe the situation of Iraqi kurds there.

39. In 1992, Ms Landesmann was taught by Professor Roland Littlewood in the
    Department of Academic Psychiatry, at University College London  (UCL),
    and she has remained in contact with him.  Professor Littlewood  has  a
    specialist interest in  Albania.   In  2000,  the  witness  attended  a
    seminar led by Professor Littlewood on blood feuds in Albania. In 2001,
    the witness attended a seminar with a presentation by Antonia Young  in
    the Anthropology Department at  UCL  on  cultural  behaviour  regarding
    Albanian women and 'sworn  virgins'  in  Albania  who  are  treated  as
    honorary men.  In June  2016,  the  witness  appeared  on  the  morning
    programme on Radio  Kent,  talking  about  why  people  want  to  leave
    Albania.

40. The witness has never been to Albania but has  nevertheless  written  a
    number  of  cultural  and  psychosocial  reports  on  circumstances  in
    Albania, concerning blood feuds, trafficking,  homosexuality,  and  the
    position of women and children.  Her knowledge of Albania appears to be
    based on the contact with Professor  Littlewood  and  on  conversations
    with Albanian asylum claimants in the United  Kingdom.   Ms  Landesmann
    considers  that  she  has  had  'the  opportunity  for  more   intimate
    conversations than I would most probably have done had I  attempted  to
    do so in situ in Albania'.

41. Ms Landesmann finds the appellant's account  entirely  plausible.   His
    account is  similar  to  other  clients'  accounts,  in  partiucalr  in
    relation to the criminal  gang  and  the  possibility  of  keeping  the
    appellant and forcing him to work off his father's debt.   The mother's
    response in removing him from Albania to  prevent  that  she  considers
    indicative of credibility: the family would know  there  was  no  other
    option, to keep him out of the hands of the gang.

42. Ms Landesmann considers the appellant's circumstances  to  be  akin  to
    that of a victim of trafficking and that, given the family structure in
    Albania, he would not be able to relocate quietly but, even in  Tirana,
    would be asked about his family background.  To that extent the witness
    disagrees with the findings in EH (Albania) that there  is  sufficiency
    of protection in the larger cities of Albania.  The need to register at
    state offices such as the police, doctors, or school,  would  make  the
    appellant visible to those pursuing him or his father.

43. On the question of sufficiency of protection, the witness says that  it
    is her 'opinion  and  experience'  that  the  police  will  not  become
    involved in a domestic situation, including domestic violence.   A  man
    has a right to beat his wife and the general attitude would  be  to  be
    dismissive, or turn a blind eye.  'In  [her]  experience',  the  father
    would regard the appellant leaving as a breach of his honour, and would
    prefer that he remained and worked  off  the  father's  debt  with  the
    criminal gang.   The police are ineffective and unable to assist  in  a
    feud, or in a situation like that of the appellant's father. The police
    and state are corrupt. The appellant's family members  could  not  help
    him as that would endanger them with the gang.  Ms Landesmann relied on
    the evidence of Ms Schwandner-Sievers, quoted  at  2.6.6-2.6.8  in  the
    respondent's Country Information and Guidance on Albania,  that  family
    reintegration was the only way to return and that family members  would
    be the first places the gang would look for the appellant.

44. The appellant would not have access to a shelter on  return.   Nor  was
    there  adequate  protection  for  children,  although   Ms   Landesmann
    recognised that the appellant was  no  longer  a  child.   The  Amnesty
    International report indicated that there were over 3000  incidents  of
    domestic violence reported to the police in 2014, mostly by women,  and
    that almost  1300  resulted  in  criminal  proceedings.   However,  the
    witness discounted the Amnesty International evidence on the basis that
    'as it is the case that it is so shameful to go to the police to report
    any incident of domestic violence or  other  matter  considered  to  be
    private family matter, that this will not represent the whole picture'.



45. The report's conclusions were as follows:

         "It is my serious considered  opinion  based  on  my  knowledge  of
         writing reports  on  domestic  violence,  trafficking,  kidnapping,
         blood feuds and honour issues that  [the  appellant's]  account  of
         what happened to him is plausible.  ...

         I think it would be unduly harsh to return [him]  to  any  part  of
         Albania as I think his life would be in  danger,  either  by  being
         destitute, by being in  danger  of  being  found  by  the  original
         criminal gang, or of  being  taken  by  another  criminal  gang  to
         burgle, beg, transport illegal substances, or  for  other  criminal
         activities  as  he  would  be  perceived  to  be  on  his  own  and
         vulnerable. The lack of ability to  find  somewhere  reasonable  to
         live or to find legitimate work will make him stand out to criminal
         gangs who will see that he will have no support and be liable to be
         an easy target.  It is also conceivable that his  father  would  be
         violent to the point of murder for [the appellant] having run  away
         and left him with  the  criminal  gang  still  wanting  their  debt
         repaid."

Other country evidence

46. In the Amnesty International press release dated 22 February 2017 which
    appears in the appellant's bundle, I was taken to a passage on  torture
    and other ill-treatment which refers to numerous reports  by  detainees
    that they were abused in custody.  This appellant  does  not  fear  the
    police or the Albanian authorities.  A  passage  on  children's  rights
    about an orphanage in Shkodra seems to have  little  relevance  to  the
    facts of this appeal today.

47. The US State Department Country Report on Human  Rights  Practices  for
    Albania,  published  in  March  2017,  contains  a  passage  indicating
    inequitable enforcement of the  law  by  police,  with  influence  from
    'personal associations, political or criminal connections',  corruption
    and unprofessional behaviour.  The government had introduced in-car and
    body  cameras  and  publicly  highlighted  anticorruption  measures.  A
    passage under 'Children' confirmed widespread,  rarely  reported  child
    abuse, with 58% of children suffering physical abuse.

48. That was the evidence before me for this appeal.

Submissions

49. In oral submissions for  the  respondent,  Mr  Wilding  relied  on  the
    refusal letter and Mr Clark's skeleton argument  served  in  compliance
    with the Upper Tribunal's directions. In that  skeleton  argument,  the
    respondent sought to  withdraw  any  concession  that  the  appellant's
    father forced him to work in Albania, although  the  domestic  violence
    remained admitted.

50. The respondent submitted that the abduction claim was a  late  addition
    which was not  credible.   The  appellant  had  not  simply  failed  to
    disclose the abductions on entry (when, although a  child,  he  was  15
    years old and the events had happened just a couple of months earlier),
    but had specifically stated that he had no other  cause  to  fear  save
    domestic violence from his father.  Even giving weight to the fact that
    the  appellant  attended  the  screening  interview  a  solicitor,  the
    appellant had not explained satisfactorily why he had not mentioned the
    abductions.

51. Nor did the appellant's evidence rebut the background  evidence  relied
    upon  in  the  refusal  letter,  which  showed  the  stringent   travel
    requirements for minors travelling alone,  operated  by  the  only  two
    airline operators flying between Tirana and Fiumicino.

52. As regards state protection, the respondent argued that it  would  have
    been open to the appellant to contact the police about  his  father  or
    the criminal gang.   The appellant did not claim to recognise the  gang
    or to know more than that they were a criminal gang.  He could not  and
    did not assert  any  credible  influence  for  his  father's  creditors
    outside the  home  area.   The  appellant's  assertion  in  his  asylum
    interview that his father had told him that the gang had influence  'in
    department for people who lodge a complaint against this group' did not
    reach the minimum standard for showing  that  such  influence  extended
    beyond the appellant's home area.

53. The respondent would rely on the guidance given at [216] in in  AM  and
    BM (trafficked women) Albania CG [2010] UKUT 80 (IAC): the risk in each
    case was fact-specific.  The appellant had been unable to explain  why,
    given his father's impecuniosity, he had been able to bribe the police.
     In EH (blood feuds) Albania CG [2012] UKUT 00348 (IAC)  at  [70],  the
    Upper Tribunal had found that internal relocation was only  ineffective
    where the aggressor group's influence extended beyond the  local  area.
    It would not be unduly harsh to return the appellant  as  an  adult  to
    Albania, where he had previously worked and was eligible for assistance
    under the AVR scheme.

54. In oral submissions, Mr Wilding contended that the appellant had failed
    to establish, even to the applicable lower standard of proof,  that  he
    had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Refugee Convention  reason
    in Albania, or would suffer serious harm contrary to Article 3 ECHR  if
    returned now.

55. Although humanitarian protection and Article 3 ECHR  were  pleaded,  Mr
    Wilding submitted that this was a case which would stand or  fall  with
    the refugee protection claim.   That  was  also  the  position  of  the
    appellant (see the First-tier Tribunal skeleton argument).

56. Mr Wilding observed that the alleged abductions happened over  a  short
    period of time, between August and October 2013, but the appellant  had
    not  mentioned  them  in  his  asylum  claim,  despite   having   three
    opportunities to disclose the abduction part of his account.  This  was
    surprising, given the appellant's account of  what  happened  on  those
    occasions.

57. When coming to the United Kingdom, there was no element of coercion  or
    trafficking.  The appellant knew he was coming to claim asylum, because
    he did not stay in France where he considered  that  he  would  not  be
    granted protection.  His witness statement graphically highlighted  the
    treatment the appellant received at the hands of his  kidnappers.   The
    abduction was the cornerstone of the appellant's asylum  claim  as  now
    advanced but not mentioned by the  appellant  on  arrival  in  December
    2013.

58. The second serious flaw in the appellant's account was that  there  was
    no explanation why his mother arranged to send  the  appellant  outside
    Albania, but not his brother, who was equally likely to  be  kidnapped,
    if the object was to put pressure on his father.  The mother  gave  the
    appellant money to go away, anywhere, without  making  any  arrangement
    for him to let her know where he ended up, ort hat he was  safe.   That
    part of the account also lacked credibility, Mr Wilding submitted.

59. Finally, the appellant's account of his journey was also incredible and
    internally contradictory.  The appellant's assertion that he  had  been
    allowed to buy a ticket for an aeroplane while an  unaccompanied  minor
    did not stand up, and the Tribunal should  reject  it.   Airlines  look
    after children who  are  travelling  alone.   Mr  Wilding  invited  the
    Tribunal to find that the appellant had not left Albania in the  manner
    described, and that the core of his story was incredible.

60. As regards the country report of Sonia Landesmann, Mr  Wilding  invited
    the Tribunal to place  little  weight  thereon.   The  report  was  not
    written to the MOJ (Somalia) standard for expert evidence.  It did  not
    make clear the basis of the  author's  claimed  country  expertise  for
    Albania, whether generally or specifically in relation to  the  present
    appeal.  Ms Landesmann had spent no time at all in Albania, and all  of
    her information was second hand.  The report relied on EH (Albania) but
    this was not a blood feud case, and Kanun law was not engaged.  Nor did
    the expert's report engage with the facts of this  applicant's  appeal.
    It was generic in content, referring to trafficking (the appellant  was
    not trafficked), the position of children (he is not a  child)  and  in
    places descended into the arena.  Overall, the Landesmann report lacked
    objectivity or expertise and should be given little weight.

61. Mr Wilding submitted that if the appellant returned to another part  of
    Albania, there was no reason to think that he would  be  identified  by
    anyone. The appellant had studied, and worked 5 minutes' walk from  his
    home, before leaving Albania.  It was not unduly harsh to expect him to
    live in Albania and should there be any difficulties,  the  authorities
    would be willing  and  able  to  assist  him.  The  appellant  had  not
    established that there was a real risk to him of persecution or serious
    harm if returned now to Albania.  He asked me to dismiss the appeal.

62. For the appellant, Mr Ali adopted the updated skeleton  argument  filed
    on the appellant's behalf for  the  hearing,  as  well  as  a  previous
    skeleton argument filed in the First-tier Tribunal.  He relied on those
    arguments, and on the appellant's oral evidence and the expert evidence
    of Sonya Landesmann, the Amnesty International report  on  Albania  for
    2016/2017 dated 22 February 2017, and  the  2016  United  States  State
    Department report on human rights practices in Albania  dated  3  March
    2017.

63. The First-tier Tribunal skeleton argument states that the appellant was
    a consistent witness in relation to the  disputed  abductions  and  has
    never stated that he feared the Albanian or Turkish  authorities.   The
    appellant's account of paying a bribe to exit  Albania  was  consistent
    with the endemic corruption in that country.  The appellant  could  not
    rely on his father's side of the family when returned,  as  they  would
    support his father. Nor could he rely  on  his  mother's  side  of  the
    family, given the response from his father's  family  when  his  mother
    sought support because of his father's mis-treatment of her.

64. Submissions in the First-tier Tribunal skeleton argument  about  family
    tracing, adequacy of reception arrangements and the applicant's section
    55 best interests are no longer relevant as the  appellant  is  now  an
    adult.

65. The appellant submitted that it would be unduly harsh to expect him  to
    live in Tirana away from his family but  without  the  Social  Services
    support to which he still had access in the United Kingdom, as  a  care
    leaving  young  person.   The  appellant's  account  was  supported  by
    background evidence and in particular, at 2.1.5  of  the  2015  Country
    Information and Guidance report on Albania, the question of  protection
    from non-state agents in Albania was always to be  fact-specific.   The
    Albanian authorities would be unwilling to  protect  a  person  in  the
    appellant's position, because he was easily identifiable by  reason  of
    his different dialect.

66. The second skeleton argument,  revised  and  settled  by  Amir  Masood,
    solicitor on  7  November  2017,  sets  out  the  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal, with lengthy extracts from Ms  Landesmann's  report  and  the
    country evidence. The submissions part of the skeleton argument  begins
    at page 13, and after arguing that the  appellant's  appeal  should  be
    allowed on asylum, humanitarian protection  and  human  rights  grounds
    (Article  3  ECHR),  the  appellant  submits  that  his   evidence   is
    consistent, with no major discrepancy, and he should be regarded  as  a
    credible historian in relation to past events,  allowances  being  made
    for his young age (15) and  limited  education,  when  he  entered  the
    United Kingdom in December 2013. The  independent  expert  evidence  is
    said to support his account, as well as the country evidence.

67. In oral submissions for the appellant, Mr Ali contended that there were
    pervasive problems in Albanian society,  leading  to  a  difficult  and
    dangerous landscape for certain groups there.   Mr Ali  relied  on  the
    2016/2017 Amnesty International report, the  country  evidence  in  the
    bundle, which dealt with  the  position  of  children  and  victims  of
    trafficking and forced labour. He accepted that the  appellant  was  no
    longer a child and had never been a victim of trafficking.  He  further
    accepted that no blood feud was alleged in this appeal.

68. The appellant had come to the United Kingdom as a teenager, leaving via
    Tirana.  Improbable as it might sound, it was not  incredible  that  he
    had  managed  to  travel  without  an  adult.   Teenagers  did   travel
    unlawfully from time to time and there was nothing incredible about his
    exit.  Mistakes happened, and corruption was always a possibility.  The
    appellant's account of what triggered his departure, and of how he left
    Albania, were plausible and credible.

69. Any problems  in  the  screening  interview  should  be  regarded  with
    caution.  The appellant had been a child of 15 at the time.  As to  why
    the appellant's brother was not also helped to leave  Albania,  Mr  Ali
    said that where funds were  tight,  parents  sometimes  had  to  choose
    between their children, which may have been  what  happened  here.  The
    appellant's evidence as to why he was not in contact with  his  mother,
    even if lacking in credibility, did not detract from the Chiver core of
    this account, which was sound.

70. Regarding the Landesmann report, Mr Ali said  that  Ms  Landesmann  had
    some expertise and was qualified to give her opinion.   Albania  was  a
    tough country and her report should be given at least some weight.

71. Having regard to the lower standard, the appellant had  shown  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution for a Refugee  Convention  reason  or  real
    risk of treatment contrary to  Article  3  ECHR  and  was  entitled  to
    protection.  The appellant was now 19 years old.   Internal  relocation
    would be unduly harsh because the requirement  to  register  for  civil
    status would make the appellant visible on return, and  corruption  was
    endemic. If the appellant moved to the north of Albania,  his  southern
    accent would identify him.   Albania  was  a  patriarchal  society  and
    curiosity would lead to adverse interest in the appellant.  The  appeal
    should be allowed.

72. I reserved my decision, which I now give.

Discussion

73. The first question is how much of the appellant's account is  credible.
    The domestic violence is not  disputed.   As  regards  the  appellant's
    journey to the United Kingdom, his account has been broadly  consistent
    throughout and one at least of  the  airlines  which  travels  in  that
    direction restricts the travel of children only up to the  age  of  14.
    The appellant was 15 when he travelled.  I accept his account of travel
    as credible, having regard to the lower standard of proof applicable in
    international protection claims.

74. That leaves the abduction claims.  They come to  this,  that  the  gang
    picked the appellant up twice, on his short journey home, and held him,
    to make his father pay the debts, and that on the second occasion, they
    threatened to keep him  and  make  him  work  to  pay  them  off.   The
    appellant says his mother was also picked up and threatened,  and  that
    before he left, his father was coming home with  bruises  so  that  the
    threats were probably being made directly to his father also.

75. There is nothing inherently incredible  in  a  father  who  drinks  and
    gambles getting into the sort of difficulty described here. However, it
    is striking that the appellant failed at  his  screening  interview  in
    December 2013 to mention the abductions, now said to be his main reason
    for leaving Albania, and that he did not mention them until his  asylum
    interview just three months later.  There is also a lack  of  coherence
    in the steps said to have been taken by his mother: if the gang  wanted
    a child of the appellant's father to work for them, his father had  two
    sons, and the younger remained in Albania.  There is a difference of  5
    years between the two boys,  as  is  evidenced  by  the  family  record
    obtained by the British Embassy in Tirana on 6 August 2014.

76. The appellant has not taken any opportunity to communicate with  family
    members in his large  extended  family,  most  of  whom  are  still  in
    Albania, to see whether his mother, father  and  younger  brother  (who
    would now be 14 years old) are safe, or whether he  is  still  at  risk
    from the criminal gang he alleges abducted him.  I  am  not  satisfied,
    even making allowances for the appellant's youth when interviewed,  and
    applying the  lower  standard  of  proof  applicable  to  international
    protection claims, that there is a reasonable degree of likelihood that
    this part of the appellant's account is true.

77. I approach determination of this appeal on the basis that the appellant
    has a father who beat both him and his mother, and  that  she  arranged
    for the appellant to leave in the manner he  explains  in  his  witness
    statement and oral evidence.   I accept that his father may  well  both
    drink and gamble, and that he may have required the appellant  to  work
    in a caf� and give the father his wages.  I reject the account  of  the
    abductions as a later embroidery of the account.  I treat the  risk  in
    this appeal as coming from the appellant's father and being confined to
    the home area.

78. When assessing the country evidence of Ms Landesmann, I  remind  myself
    of the guidance given by this Tribunal  in  SW  (lesbians)  Jamaica  CG
    [2011] UKUT 251 (IAC) at [88]-[89]

         "88. ... As regards knowledge of a country, the Tribunal  has  also
         stated in key cases that to be an expert one does  not  necessarily
         have to live there or to visit regularly.

         89.  We reminded ourselves of the guidance given by  the  European
         Court of Human Rights in  NA v The United Kingdom (Application no.
         25904/07) [2008] ECHR on the assessment of country information  and
         expert evidence in particular:

             "120.    In assessing such  material,  consideration  must  be
             given  to  its  source,  in   particular   its   independence,
             reliability  and  objectivity.  In  respect  of  reports,  the
             authority and reputation of the author, the seriousness of the
             investigations by means  of  which  they  were  compiled,  the
             consistency of their conclusions and  their  corroboration  by
             other sources are all relevant considerations  (see Saadi  v.
             Italy, cited above, � 143).

             121. The Court also  recognises  that  consideration  must  be
             given to the presence and reporting capacities of  the  author
             of the material in the country in question. ...

             122. While the Court accepts that many reports are,  by  their
             very nature,  general  assessments,  greater  importance  must
             necessarily be attached to reports which  consider  the  human
             rights situation in the country of  destination  and  directly
             address the grounds for the alleged real risk of ill-treatment
             in the case before the  Court.  Ultimately,  the  Court's  own
             assessment of the human  rights  situation  in  a  country  of
             destination is carried out only  to  determine  whether  there
             would be a violation of Article 3 if the applicant in the case
             before it were to be returned to that country. Thus the weight
             to be attached  to  independent  assessments  must  inevitably
             depend on the extent to which those assessments are couched in
             terms similar to Article 3. ...""

79. In MOJ  at [25], the Upper Tribunal gave the following  guidance  about
    expert evidence before this Tribunal, having reviewed the authorities:

             "25. Thus in  the  contemporary  era  the  subject  of  expert
             evidence  and  experts'  reports  is  heavily  regulated.  The
             principles,  rules  and  criteria  highlighted  above  are  of
             general application. They apply to experts giving evidence  at
             every tier of the legal system. In the specific sphere of  the
             Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum   Chamber),   these
             standards apply fully, without any  qualification.   They  are
             reflected in the Senior President's Practice Direction  No  10
             (2010) which, in paragraph 10, lays particular emphasis  on  a
             series of duties. We summarise these duties thus:

             (i)    to   provide   information   and    express    opinions
             independently, uninfluenced by the litigation;

             (ii) to consider all material  facts,  including  those  which
             might detract from the expert witness' opinion ;

             (iii)    to be objective and unbiased;

             (iv) to  avoid  trespass  into  the  prohibited  territory  of
             advocacy;

             (v)  to be fully informed;

             (vi) to act within the  confines  of  the  witness's  area  of
             expertise; and

             (vii)     to   modify,   or   abandon    one's   view,   where
             appropriate."

80. Ms Landesmann in her report gives opinion evidence  about  Albania,  an
    area where she has no direct knowledge, has not undertaken any academic
    study, and has little or no discernible expertise:   her  report  is  a
    mishmash  of  other  country  reports  and  unsourced  assertions.   Ms
    Landesmann has never visited Albania.  Her report  lacks  any  sign  of
    serious  investigation  or  corroboration  of  sources   and   descends
    impermissibly into the arena.

81. It may be that  Ms  Landesmann  has  expertise  in  relation  to  other
    countries such as Turkey, Iran or Iraq, but, absent the opportunity  to
    test her knowledge in cross-examination,  I  am  unable  to  place  any
    weight on her evidence in the report before me.

EH (Albania) guidance

82. The Upper Tribunal's country guidance in EH (Albania) was summarised in
    the judicial headnote.  The case concerns  blood  feuds  and  the  only
    relevant guidance for the present purpose is this:

         "3.   The  Albanian  state  has  taken  steps  to   improve   state
         protection, but in areas where Kanun law predominates (particularly
         in northern Albania) those steps do not yet provide sufficiency  of
         protection from Kanun-related blood-taking if an active feud exists
         and affects the individual claimant.   Internal  relocation  to  an
         area of Albania less dependent on the Kanun may provide  sufficient
         protection, depending on the reach, influence,  and  commitment  to
         prosecution of the feud by the aggressor clan."

    That is amplified in the decision itself at [70]:

         "70. Internal relocation will be effective to protect an  appellant
         only where the risk does not extend beyond  the  appellant's  local
         area and he is unlikely to be traced in the rest of Albania by the
         aggressor clan.  A crucial factor in establishing whether  internal
         relocation is a real possibility is the geographical and  political
         reach of the  aggressor  clan:   where  that  clan  has  government
         connections, locally or more widely, the  requirement  to  transfer
         civil registration to a new area, as set out at 2.4.4 above,  would
         appear to obviate the possibility of 'disappearing' in another part
         of the country, and would be likely to drive the male members of  a
         victim  clan  to  self-confinement  in  the   home   area   as   an
         alternative.  Whether internal  relocation  is  reasonable  in  any
         particular appeal will always be a question of fact for  the  fact-
         finding Tribunal."

    It is not alleged that there is a blood feud in this appeal, and I have
    not found it credible that a criminal gang are pursuing the  appellant,
    his mother and his father, in the manner alleged or at all.

83. In TD and AD (Trafficked women) (CG) [2016] UKUT  92  (IAC)  the  Upper
    Tribunal found that in the case of trafficked women, return to  another
    area of Albania required the consideration of specific factors such  as
    the social status and economic standing of their family; their level of
    education; their mental and physical health; the area of origin;  their
    age; and the available support network.  There is no  consideration  at
    that level of detail in the present decision.

84. In R on the application of FR & Anor (Albania) v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 605, applying the  decision  in  EV
    (Albania), Lord Justice Beatson, with  whom  Lord  Justices  Davis  and
    Lindblom agreed, at [108] accepted that  domestic  violence  is  rarely
    punished in Albania but held that:

         "108.    ... But if FR is relocated, unless her husband  or  family
         can find her, [the failure of the Albanian  authorities  to  punish
         domestic violence] is not in point. FR's claim gives no grounds for
         considering that her former husband and her family have a reach all
         over Albania and so, in line with the guidance in EH's case at [70]
         and [74](c)] set out at [9] and [79] above, it cannot be said  that
         internal relocation will be  ineffective  to  protect  her  because
         domestic violence is rarely punished."

85. This appellant is a young man who travelled  successfully  on  his  own
    passport from Albania to the United Kingdom via France.  He reached the
    United Kingdom when he was 15 years old and  has  had  the  benefit  of
    education here, although he has  not  chosen  to  provide  any  details
    thereof.  There was no updated witness statement to tell  the  Tribunal
    what he has been doing since 2015, whether he has continued to study or
    begun employment.   The very limited evidence before me about  internal
    relocation is not much more than a bare assertion  that  he  could  not
    live away from his home area, but yet he has been able to live  in  the
    United Kingdom, which he did not know at all, for a period of 4  years.
     The appellant is no longer a child and section 55 does  not  apply  to
    him, nor is there any question of adequacy of reception arrangements at
    his age.

DECISION

86. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.  I set aside  the  previous  decision.   I  remake  the
    decision by dismissing the appeal.
