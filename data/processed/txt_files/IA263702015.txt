                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In the light of Khan v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1775, the First-tier Tribunal Judge was wrong in law to
    conclude that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

 2. On 3rd January 2018 I issued a decision indicating  that  the  Tribunal
    was minded to find an error of law, set aside the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge and remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.  Any
    party opposed to this course was directed to  inform  the  Tribunal  in
    writing not later than 7 days from the date this decision was  sent  by
    the Upper Tribunal. There has been no communication from  either  party
    and I have therefore proceeded to a decision as to whether there is  an
    error of law.

 3. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law and his decision is set  aside.
 The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.
