                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Cope promulgated on 12th February 2013 following a hearing at
        North Shields, in which he  dismissed  the  appeals  of  all  three
        appellants against the direction for their removal to Pakistan that
        accompanied the rejection of their claims for asylum or  any  other
        form of international protection.


     2. Permission to appeal the above decision was refused by a Designated
        Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but  granted  on  a   renewed
        application by Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley on 22nd April 2013.



Background


     3. The first appellant was born on 12th December 1982.  The  remaining
        two appellants are her minor children who are  dependent  upon  her
        claim and who, due to their ages, did not give  evidence  and  were
        not involved in the proceedings before Judge Cope.


     4. Judge Cope considered the written and oral evidence he received and
        set out his findings from paragraph 24 the determination which  can
        be summarised as follows:

              i.  The principal issue in the case is the credibility of  the
first appellant                 [25].

              ii. The first appellant has in  effect  given  an  account  of
events affecting                her on six different occasions  set  out  in
paragraph 28.

              iii.     There is  some  degree  of  consistency  between  the
accounts given on                   the various occasions.  First  appellant
has made it clear she feels she                  will face death or  serious
ill treatment at the hands of her husband                 and that  she  and
the other appellants will not be safe anywhere in                   Pakistan
[29].

               iv.  It  was  accepted  that  something  of  what  the  first
appellant had to say                about the  general  situation  of  women
and domestic violence  in                      Pakistan  and  how  they  are
viewed in that country by the authorities,                 particularly  the
police     and     within     society     as     a     whole     is      not
inconsistent with the background evidence [30].

              v.   Consistency  between  the  accounts  and  the  background
evidence is a                   factor which should be put to the credit  of
the appellant which the                 Judge did [31].

               vi.  Consistency  in  itself  should  and   does   not   lead
necessarily to a                    finding of credibility  as  there  could
be adverse explanations for a                witness being able on a  number
of occasions to provide a similar                account of events which  it
is claimed happened to them. It is  an                      assessment  that
has to be made in the context of the evidence in the                case  as
a whole [31].

               vii.      Domestic  violence  is  a  serious  and  widespread
problem for women                   in Pakistan. Many  women  face  violence
and abuse at the hands of               their own families  particularly  if
they are perceived in some way to                be dishonouring the  family
name [34].

              viii.    Background evidence relating  to  Pakistan  and  that
relating to women                   is the starting point in  the  case  and
it is within the context of this                  background  evidence  that
the claims of the first  and  second                     appellant  to  have
suffered     domestic     violence     at     the     hands      of      her
husband/father are to be considered [35].

              ix. The appellant has  provided  a  document  described  as  a
police report                   but there are significant difficulties  with
that and whether it supports                 her case as she contends [37].

               x.   The  Judge  stated  he  was  aware  not  only  from  the
background                      evidence but from having heard many  appeals
from Pakistan that                  there is a system of  First  Information
Reports [FIR] which are formal               written records  of  complaints
made to the police [39].

              xi. The format  of  the  police  report  relied  upon  by  the
appellant is not in                 the same format as those the  Judge  was
used to seeing for  such                       reports  from  Pakistan.  The
Judge states he has seen  a  considerable                    number  in  the
years he has been sitting in this jurisdiction [40].

              xii.     The police report is stated  by  the  Judge  to  read
quite simply as a                   letter written by the  first  appellant,
it being in the first person, rather                  than being  some  form
of statement or report taken by  a  police  officer                    which
would be in the third person [40].

              xiii.    Even if this  was  a  complaint  made  by  the  first
appellant and  if  the                 purple  ink  stamps  stating  "Police
Station Defence Lahore" is genuine,                    this  gives  rise  to
the question why would they  have  accepted  the                   complaint
given   the   comments   made   by   the    first    appellants    in    her
screening and asylum  interviews  about  their  reaction  to  her  going  to
         the police station [41].

              xiv.     It does not make sense that  the  police  would  have
allowed the first                   appellant  to  report  the  matter,  and
thus stamp the document from                 her, if her husband really  was
as powerful and influential as she               claims he  was  -  question
42 first SEF interview and reply to question                    157  of  the
second asylum interview [42].

              xv. It was also noted  that  the  translation  of  the  police
report makes no                 mention of the second appellant  having  had
his arm broken. The first                appellant  claimed  in  her  second
asylum interview that the police                 officer did not write  this
down even though she asked him to. It is                  difficult  to  see
why the officer would have been prepared  to  say  the                 first
appellant's  husband  would   kill   her   within   two   weeks   and   also
break the children's bones, but not record this event [43].

              xvi.     In light of the above and other  issues  with  regard
to the rest of the                  appellant's  evidence  set  out  in  the
determination, and in light of the               guidance in Tanveer  Ahmed,
the Judge considered he was unable  to                  place  any  reliance
upon the police report [44].

              xvii.    A letter from a  nurse  at  the  Newcroft  Centre  in
Newcastle  upon                   Tyne,  a  community-based  health  clinic,
notes a scar on the inner                aspect  of  the  first  appellant's
right  thigh,  although   there   was   no                      attempt   to
independently   state   what   caused   the   scar   nor   was    there    a
detailed description of  it.  All  there  is  was  a  note  that  the  first
              appellant told the nurses that this was  an  injury  sustained
during  a                    sexual  assault  on  18th  May  2012  when  the
assailant dug his                       thumbnail into her flesh [46].

              xviii.   The Judge accepted there is a scar  as  described  in
the letter but                      without a  further  description  or  any
suggestion of causation  it  was                not  considered  the  letter
actually assists the first appellant's case [47].

              xix.      Although  the  appellant  told  the  nurse  she  was
sexually assaulted on               18th May 2012 this date is not  referred
to by her in any  other  account                she  has  given  during  the
asylum application  process.  She  claims  the                 rape  by  the
police   took   place    on    either    11th    May    when    she    first
reported  her  husband  or  16th  May  which  might  have  been   when   she
     made her first report or might have  been  the  second  time  she  went
              back to the police, if she did so [48].

              xx.  Health  records  from  the  Health  Integration  Team  in
Barnsley made                   no mention of the first  appellant  claiming
she was raped in May 2012               [49].

              xxi.     In relation to the second appellant,  although  there
is mention of him                   having a fractured  left  wrist  in  May
2012  there  is  no  suggestion  as  to                 causation   and   in
particular no complaint that this was caused by  his                 father.
Instead  it  is  recorded  that  the  first  appellant   said   the   second
     appellant had been slapped on his left ear by  his  father  four  years
              ago during an argument between the parents which had left  him
                  suffering from pain and altered hearing [50].

              xxii.    If the first  appellant  was  prepared  to  tell  the
person conducting the               initial accommodation health  assessment
about the incident that  had                   been  caused  by  the  second
appellant's father it is not  plausible  that                she  would  not
mention the fractured wrist if this had been caused  by                  him
much more recently [51].

              xxiii.   The claim by  the  first  appellant  in  the  medical
document that the                    second  appellant  was  having  hearing
problems caused by  his  father                 slapping  him  is  mentioned
elsewhere in the various  accounts  the  first                appellant  has
given of events in Pakistan [52].

              xxiv.    It is not credible that if  the  incident  had  taken
place with such                      serious  consequences  for  the  second
appellant,  that  the  first  appellant                    would  not   have
mentioned it during her lengthy  asylum  interviews                   or  in
either of her written statements [53].

               xxv.      Related  to  this   issue   is   the   considerable
difficulties there are for the               first  appellant  in  what  she
had to say in the first asylum interview                  about whether  her
husband had previously beaten the second                       appellant  or
not [54].

              xxvi.    The first appellant stated  in  that  interview  that
before she reported                 the matter to the  police  in  May  2012
her husband had not  touched                   her  children.  In  the  next
question she  completely  contradicted  herself                    and  said
that her husband had hit the second appellant many  times                and
thrown the third appellant on the bed [55].

              xxvii. In her appeal statement the first  appellant  suggested
that she had               mentioned several times  in  the  interview  that
her husband had                     threatened to kill them all and used  to
beat  them  many  times  but                 having  read  the  records   of
interview, these show this is not true in                  relation  to  the
second   and   third   appellant   so   far    as    physical    abuse    is
concerned [56].

              xxviii. There are numerous significant contradictions  between
what  the                    first  appellant  said  in  her  first   asylum
interview and what she said in               her second asylum interview  as
identified in the reasons for refusal                  letter  [58].  Having
considered the responses and other documentary                 evidence  the
Judge was satisfied that the  matters  of  concern  were                well
founded  and  that  the  response  of   the   first   appellant   does   not
adequately deal with the adverse conclusions reached [59].

              xxix.     An  example  of  such  contradiction  includes  that
relating to the                     account given by the first appellant  as
to how her husband broke the                 arm of  the  second  appellant.
At question 35 of the first interview the                 appellant  claimed
that her husband had hit him with a cricket  bat                 whereas  in
the second interview she describes the arm  being  broken                 by
her  husband  pulling  the  second  appellant  away  from  her   [61].    In
      her  response  the  first  appellant   has   not   deal   with   these
contradictions                  and does not say how the  arm  was  actually
broken, it was considered               she would be expected to  have  been
able to  find  out  [62].  The                        medical  records  from
Pakistan, which include x-rays, record a                        fracture  of
the  second  appellant's  wrist  as  a  result  of   his   falling   off   a
slide [63].

              xxx.     The Judge notes that he has no  difficulty  with  the
concept of a victim                 of domestic violence not  being  willing
to describe  the  real  cause  of  an                  injury  to  a  doctor
although there  is  an  alternative  explanation  namely                 the
first  appellant  is  not  telling  the  truth  and  the  second   appellant
     did indeed fall off a slide resulting in injury [65].

              xxxi.    The appellant claims that on one  occasion  she  took
refuge in a                     women's shelter although there  was  nothing
provided from the                       refuge to which it  is  claimed  the
first appellant went in order to                       support  that  aspect
of her case [66].

              xxxii. A further major discrepancy relates to the question  of
whether the                first appellant did  report  the  matter  to  the
police in May 2012 as the               appellant  contradicted  herself  as
to whether there had been one or                 more visits to  the  police
station [67]. In her first  interview  the  first                  appellant
clearly  stated  she  did  not  return   to   the   police   station   after
she  made  the   initial   complaint.    She   alleged   her   husband   had
     telephoned  her  and  threatened  her  and  the  children  because  she
         involved the police [68].  At  the  second  interview  a  different
picture                emerged as she said the police came to the  house  of
a friend of hers                where she and the children were  living  and
told her to go back to the                   police station. There  she  was
interviewed about her complaint and                   assaulted [69].

              xxxiii. The appellant's explanation for  the  discrepancy  was
not accepted as                 being plausible. There was  nothing  in  her
asylum interview to                     suggest she was forced  to  go  back
to the police, for instance by being                  arrested. In  question
188 the appellant appears to suggest  it  was  a                   voluntary
second attendance prompted by a visit from the police  to                her
friend's house [71].

               xxxiv.  Related  to  this  major  discrepancy  in  the  first
appellant's account is                  the claim  she  made  that  she  was
raped by the police when she                      reported  her  husband  to
them. The  reply  to  question  188-189  of  the                 second  SEF
interview  implies  the  rape   took   place   on   her   first   visit   to
the police  station  whereas  in  reply  to  question  190  she  claims  the
         rape took place on the second visit to the police station [72].

              xxxv. The appellant's claim the rape  occurred  on  the  first
visit is                        implausible as  she  states  that  when  she
went to make a complaint to                  the police she was  accompanied
by her father. What the country                  material says is that  rape
by the police is not unknown in Pakistan,                 but it  was  found
implausible that such an incident would have taken                 place  in
the presence or company of the first appellant's father [74].

              xxxvi. The claim at paragraph  11  of  her  initial  statement
mentioning                      religion in relation  to  the  asylum  claim
and  in  paragraph  14                      regarding  to  a  road   traffic
accident  are  both  elements  dependent                   upon  her   being
accepted   as   witness   of   truth.   In   relation    to    the    second
incident Pakistan has a high rate of road traffic  accidents  and  it  could
              have been that, without any sinister overtones [74 -75].

              xxxvii. The Judge felt  unable  to  place  significant  weight
upon the second                  appellant's  statement.   A  seven-year-old
child can be told  what  to  say                 by  a  parent  and  due  to
considerable concerns about the truthfulness                   of the  first
appellant [79].

              xxxviii. The appellant's passports  are  accepted  as  genuine
valid  travel                documents  although  vignettes  placed  in  the
passport purportedly                 indicating  entry  clearance  had  been
granted to the appellants were               forged [81-82].

              xxxix. The first appellant accepted the documents were  forged
which                  seriously damages the credibility of the claim  as  a
whole. If she was                   able to use genuine passports  to  leave
Pakistan the Judge was unable                to see why she would  not  have
been able to apply for and  obtain                 genuine  entry  clearance
vignettes from the High Commission in                 Islamabad [84].

              xl. Giving credit to  the  first  appellant  for  the  limited
consistency,  the                 factors   pointing   towards   the   first
appellant being a witness of truth               are  completely  outweighed
by the  difficulties  identified  in  the                      determination
which    cannot    be     classed     as     peripheral     or     of     no
consequence  but  rather  fundamental  and  extensive  and   affecting   the
         core of her claim [87].

              xli.     It was not accepted  that  the  first  appellant  has
shown it was                    reasonably likely that she has been  telling
the truth  about  events  in                Pakistan  and  that  she  has  a
subjective fear of persecution for the                reasons she has  given
[89].  Whilst it is  accepted  the  appellants'  are                    from
Pakistan  and  the  second   appellant   has   at   some   stage   fractured
his  wrist,  they  had  not   establish   their   case   for   international
         protection.   The  first  appellant  had  not  shown  it  was  even
reasonably                 likely that she has been the subject of  domestic
violence at the hands               of  her  husband,  or  that  either  the
second or third appellants had been                   physically  abused  by
their father, the first appellant reported  matters                  to  the
police  but   was   raped   by   them,   and   she   and   the   other   two
appellants had to flee their  husband/father  lived  with  a  friend,  in  a
         women's shelter, or with her parents; or that they face any  danger
at                the hands of her husband/father or  his  associates  [90].

     5. Having set out his core findings Judge Cope  went  on  to  consider
        entitlement to asylum, humanitarian protection, or under  the  case
        under the Human Rights Act in relation to which it  was  not  found
        that the appellants had discharged the burden of proof upon them to
        the required standard to show that they were able to succeed on any
        of the above grounds [91 - 99]



Discussion



     6. The first ground alleges Judge Cope highlighted  the  fact  he  had
        heard many appeals involving FIR from Pakistan  to  which  he  then
        proceeded to apply his judicial knowledge.  The Judge is challenged
        for allegedly taking on  the  role  of  an  expert  such  that  his
        consideration and method of assessing the evidence amounted  to  an
        error of law. In his submissions Mr  Rana  claimed  the  Judge  had
        seven  pieces  of  evidence  before  him  that  should  have   been
        considered and that the Judge failed to take all these into  proper
        account.  In relation to the FIR he submitted Judge Cope failed  to
        give adequate reasons to support his conclusions as it is not known
        how the police in Pakistan behave and he could not know what was in
        the mind of the police officers regarding the issue of rape.


     7. In Y v SSHD [2006] EWHC 1223 the court said that a  decision  maker
        was entitled to  regard  a  claimant's  account  as  incredible  by
        drawing on his own common sense and his ability as a practical  and
        informed person to identify what was and was not plausible - albeit
        that he had to take care not to reject an  account  as  implausible
        because it would not seem reasonable if it happened in the  UK.  In
        essence  the  decision  maker  must  look  through  the  spectacles
        provided by the information he has about conditions in the  country
        in question. I find this is clearly the  approach  taken  by  Judge
        Cope.


     8. I accept Judge Cope has considerable  experience  sitting  in  this
        jurisdiction during which he has seen a number of police reports or
        FIR from Pakistan. This statement is  factually  correct  as  Judge
        Cope is an experienced fee paid judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal.
        His observation in paragraph 40 that the document is in the form of
        a letter written by the  first  appellant,  in  the  first  person,
        rather than being in the form of a  statement  taken  by  a  police
        officer, which will be in the third person, is  factually  correct.
        In paragraph 41 the Judge casts doubt upon  whether  this  document
        would have been created  or  accepted  had  the  circumstances  the
        appellant  alleged  applied,  and   noted   deficiencies   in   the
        information the Judge would have thought would have been in such  a
        document, if the account were true.  The FIR was also mentioned  in
        the reasons for refusal letter, at paragraph 32, but  the  document
        the appellant submitted was not translated  and,  although  it  was
        returned to her at interview to obtain a  translation  and  several
        months had elapsed, the translation nor original were  returned  to
        UKBA for consideration. It was found that the appellant  not  shown
        this document could be  relied  upon.   Notwithstanding  the  clear
        rejection no expert evidence was obtained relating to the  validity
        of the FIR.  I do not accept that it has been  established  that  a
        finding made based  upon  the  judicial  knowledge  of  Judge  Cope
        created any unfairness or amounts to a material error  in  relation
        to the decision to dismiss the appeal, as findings made in relation
        to this document are in the range of findings open to  him  on  the
        evidence. It is not a finding made solely upon his experience which
        may have necessitated him advising the parties of his  opinion  and
        inviting submissions in response, but based upon a consideration of
        the evidence beyond his actual knowledge.


     9. In relation to the reasons challenge, the  reason  I  set  out  the
        summary of the findings at length  above  is  to  demonstrate  that
        Judge Cope clearly considered the evidence with the degree of  care
        required in an appeal of this nature, that of anxious scrutiny, and
        has given adequate reasons for the findings  he  made.   In  Shizad
        (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC)  Blake  J)
        the Tribunal held that (i) Although there is a legal duty to give a
        brief explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on  which
        an appeal is determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the
        decision as a whole makes sense,  having  regard  to  the  material
        accepted by the judge; (ii) Although  a  decision  may  contain  an
        error of law where the requirements to give  adequate  reasons  are
        not met, the Upper Tribunal would not normally set aside a decision
        of the First-tier Tribunal where there has been no misdirection  of
        law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised and the relevant
        Country  Guidance  has  been  taken  into   account,   unless   the
        conclusions  the  judge  draws  from  the  primary  data  were  not
        reasonably open to him or her.


    10. The weight to be given to the evidence as a whole was a matter  for
        Judge Cope provided he considered the evidence with the appropriate
        degree of care and gave adequate reasons, which I have found in the
        above paragraph he did, - see SS (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ
        155 at paragraph 21. Also in Green (Article 8 - new  rules)  [2013]
        UKUT 254 (IAC) (Blake J) the Tribunal said that "Giving weight to a
        factor one way or another is for the fact finding Tribunal and  the
        assignment of weight will rarely give rise to an error of law".


    11. Mr Rana further submitted that the Judge  should  have  taken  into
        account the demeanour of the appellant in  interview  where  it  is
        recorded she became tearful. The Judge was also able to observe the
        appellant giving evidence and should have taken her demeanour  into
        account then too.  He submitted that her  demeanour  indicated  she
        was either a good actress of her account was  true  and  that  when
        assessing the weight to give her evidence  the  Judge  should  have
        considered the element of demeanour.


    12. I accept that the record indicates that the first appellant  became
        upset when answering questions regarding the domestic violence  and
        rape allegation but this  forms  part  of  the  evidence  that  was
        clearly taken into account by the Judge. In relation to  demeanour,
        in B (Kosovo) [2003] UKIAT 00013 the Tribunal said that,  whilst  a
        witness's demeanour is said  to  be  a  very  unreliable  guide  to
        credibility, his personal appearance  may  in  some  cases  form  a
        legitimate part of the assessment of the  risk  (if  any)  that  he
        faces.  The examples given were the scarring of Tamils returning to
        Sri Lanka and, in this case, the non  Roma  like  appearance  of  a
        Gorani returning  to  Kosovo.   In  MM  (DRC)  [2005]  UKIAT  00019
        (Ouseley) the Tribunal said that  in  general  the  demeanor  of  a
        witness should not be relied on but rather it is the content of the
        evidence as a whole which must underpin any credibility findings.


    13. I find Judge Cope would have been aware of this element of the case
        and had the opportunity to observe the first appellant giving  oral
        evidence before him. This is, in effect, a further challenge to the
        weight the Judge gave to a particular aspect of the evidence  when,
        as stated above, that was a matter for the Judge.


    14. Grounds 2 and 3 challenge the adverse credibility findings  on  the
        basis on which some were made but  this  only  refers  to  findings
        regarding the failure to obtain evidence from the  refuge  and  the
        failure to obtain legal entry clearance from the High Commission in
        Pakistan.  The findings in relation to these matters were  findings
        open to the Judge on the evidence and even if it was to be  thought
        by some  that  they  amount  to  legal  error,  a  reading  of  the
        determination shows there  were  a  considerable  number  of  other
        fundamental flaws in the evidence sufficient to warrant the adverse
        credibility finding Judge Cope made.


    15. Ground 4 alleges the Judge failed to consider the evidence with the
        required degree of  'anxious  scrutiny'  but  this  ground  has  no
        arguable merit as he clearly did.  Ground 5 alleges inadequate  and
        proper reasons were not given for rejecting the central core of the
        appellant's asylum claim notwithstanding  the  acceptance  of  some
        elements of the claim were consistent, and country material. I find
        this ground has  no  arguable  merit  as  the  Judge  clearly  gave
        adequate reasons to support the findings made.


    16. In summary, the appellant's challenge is based on an allegation  of
        inadequate reasons and a challenge to the weight the Judge gave  to
        the evidence he was asked to consider.  I do not accept there was a
        shared burden on the Secretary of State to  prove  the  appellant's
        case for her as under English law the burden is upon her  to  prove
        that she is entitled to a grant of international protection to  the
        lower  standard  applied  by  the  Judge.  However  eloquently  the
        submissions have been made by Mr Rana they  do  not  establish  any
        material error of law in this determination. Judge Cope's  findings
        are within the range of  findings  properly  open  to  him  on  the
        evidence and have not been shown to  be  perverse,  irrational,  or
        contrary to the evidence.  Mere  disagreement  does  not  establish
        legal error.


Decision

    17. There is no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    18. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


          I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal
   Procedure               (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
