Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Davidson of Counsel instructed by S Satha & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer

1. That "precariousness" is a criterion of relevance to family life as  well
as private life cases is an established part  of  Article  8  jurisprudence:
see  e.g.  R  (Nagre)  v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  and  Jeunesse  v
Netherlands, app.no.12738/10 (GC).

2.  The  "little  weight"  provisions  of  s.117B(4)(a)  and  (5)   of   the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 are confined to "private  life"
established by a person at a time when their immigration status is  unlawful
or precarious. However, this does not mean that when answering  the  "public
interest  question"  posed  by  s117A(2)-(3)  a  court  or  tribunal  should
disregard  "precarious family life" criteria set out in established  Article
8 jurisprudence. Given that ss.117A-D considerations are not exhaustive,  in
certain cases it may be  an  error  of  law  for  a  court  or  tribunal  to
disregard relevant public interest considerations.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This case raises a particular issue about the  scope  and  ambit  of  the
"little weight" considerations to be found in s117B(4(a))  and  (5)  of  the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the full text of which is  set
out in the Appendix.

2. The appellant is a 62 year old citizen of Canada who is a  widow  and  is
blind. She had come to the UK as a visitor from 4 August 2013 to 30  January
2014. On 31 January 2014 she returned to Canada. On  19  February  2014  she
returned to the UK. She was questioned by immigration officers and  admitted
for 3 months only. On 15 May 2014 her solicitors applied on her  behalf  for
leave to remain in the UK on the basis of her private life. In  the  UK  she
has a younger daughter,  and  a  son-in-law,  the  latter  being  a  British
citizen who had lived in the UK since September 2005 having qualified  as  a
software engineer. Her younger daughter, like the appellant, is  a  Canadian
citizen. Her younger daughter has leave to remain in the UK  until  4  March
2016.The couple now have a son born in August 2013.

 3. The appellant had migrated from Sri Lanka to British Columbia in  Canada
with her younger daughter in October  2007.  In  Canada  the  appellant  has
another older daughter, who has a son born in December  2007  who  has  been
diagnosed in 2009 with autism  spectrum  disorder.  The  appellant  and  her
younger daughter originally lived with her older daughter  and  her  husband
in Vancouver, British Columbia. In November 2009 they moved out  and  rented
a room in a house in the same area. After her  younger  daughter  married  a
man who lived in the UK, she left in August 2012  to  join  him  there.  The
appellant then lived on her  own.  Because  of  her  disability  the  family
arranged for a carer to come and attend to her some  of  the  time.  It  was
said that language problems meant it was not possible for that  care  to  be
effective. She was said to have had difficulties looking after  her  day  to
day  affairs,  requiring  long-term  personal  care  as  a  result  of   her
disability. Since the departure of her younger  daughter  from  Canada,  she
was  said  to  have  suffered   depression   and   loneliness   leading   to
deterioration in her medical condition.

4. In refusing the appellant's application on 14 July  2014  the  respondent
stated that the appellant did not qualify under paragraph 276ADE(1)  of  the
Immigration Rules, noting, inter alia, that since she had family members  in
Canada it could not be said she had lost all ties with that country.

5. The  respondent  also  considered  whether  there  were  any  exceptional
circumstances warranting a grant of leave on Article 8 grounds  outside  the
Rules. The respondent noted that the appellant claimed to be a dependent  on
her family members in the UK. The respondent also noted that  she  was  said
to be  suffering  from  various  medical  conditions,  but  considered  that
treatment for these would be available for  her  in  her  home  country  and
that, if she was seeking to come as a dependent, she  could  return  to  her
home country and apply  from  there  for  entry  clearance.   The  appellant
appealed, maintaining that she had no close relations in Canada  to  provide
the required level of support and care for her whereas by contrast  she  had
a strong family life ties with her younger daughter and her  family  in  the
UK.

6. The appellant appealed. Following a hearing which took place on  17  July
2015, First tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge Seelhoff dismissed the  appeal.  In  a
decision sent on 27 July 2015  the  judge  noted  that  the  respondent  had
chosen not to be represented and that it was just to proceed with  the  case
in the respondent's absence. He noted that counsel  for  the  appellant,  Mr
Richardson, "sensibly accepted that there  is  adequate  health  and  social
services care in Canada ...and that the case is solely based  on  Article  8
family life rights".

7. The appellant gave evidence during which she said  that  when  in  Canada
her older daughter who was settled in that country did come to  see  her  to
take her to the doctor  but   did  not  see  her  every  week  as  she  (the
daughter) was suffering from depression and  had  problems  caring  for  her
autistic son. The appellant said that the decision that she should  stay  in
the UK had only been taken after she had returned to the UK on  19  February
2014. Her younger daughter also gave evidence in the  course  of  which  she
said that she had contacted social services in  Canada  for  help  with  her
mother and had been told they could not help as she had  been  sponsored  by
her older sister.  The family had looked  into  residential  care  homes  in
Canada but had not found anything  suitable  because  of  the  language  and
cultural problems. She said that her older  sister  lived  some  20  minutes
walking distance from the  appellant  and  had  met  the  appellant  at  the
airport last time and also driven her to the airport on the occasion of  her
last departure from Canada  to  the  UK.  The  judge  also  had  before  him
documentary evidence which included a number of doctor's  letters  including
a GP letter dated 6 February 2015 confirming that the  appellant  was  blind
and suffering  from  anxiety  with  depression,  hypertension  and  type  II
diabetes and was completely dependent on her younger  daughter's  assistance
for her day-to-day activities and that her diabetes is poorly controlled.

8. The judge noted that he had only been asked to consider the  claim  based
on Article 8 outside the Rules but that  reviewing  the  requirements  under
the rules relating to adult dependent relatives contained  in  Appendix  FM,
the fact that it had been conceded that care was available in  Canada  meant
that the application had to fail and not  only  because  the  appellant  had
been admitted as a visitor and was not eligible to switch categories.

9. As regards Article  8  outside  the  Rules,  the  judge  cited  case  law
governing how to approach Article 8 claims outside the  Rules,  including  R
(Nagre) v SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  and  added  that  it  was  "also
necessary to have regard to a  number  of  mandatory  factors  contained  in
s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended".

10. The judge said he accepted the appellant has a family  life  in  the  UK
with her younger daughter, son-in-law and grandson  and  that  the  decision
refusing leave to remain amounted to an interference  with  that  right.  In
this regard he noted that her younger daughter and  son-in-law  appeared  to
have taken responsibility for the appellant's care, at least in the  context
of her most recent period of stay in the UK: see [34]  and  [36].   At  [34]
the judge said that:

    "I accept that  family  life  between  children  and  adult  dependents
    relatives can engage Article 8 in special circumstances and in  a  case
    like  this  where  there  has  clearly  been  a  caring  and  dependent
    relationship...."

11. However, when  assessing  the  proportionality  of  the  decision  under
challenge, the judge considered there were  several  (interrelated)  factors
that made the refusal of leave proportionate. First, the appellant  did  not
meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  and  there  was  a  public
interest in persons in the  appellant's  position  not  being  eligible  for
leave to remain in the UK where there was adequate care available  in  their
country of nationality ([39]). Second, the  family  had  not  been  entirely
forthcoming  about  the  history  of  the  appellant  in  Canada   and   the
circumstances of her coming to the UK on a  second  occasion.  At  [35]  the
judge said that:

    "I consider it  significant  that  the  family  thought  the  Appellant
    entitled to return to the UK for a further six months within two  weeks
    of leaving the UK after a six month visa. The family clearly considered
    it acceptable for visit visas to be used as  a  way  of  the  Appellant
    effectively living in the UK and it was only when this  was  challenged
    by an entry clearance office  on  admitting  the  Appellant  for  three
    months that the Appellant sought a longer period of leave."

12. The lack of candour regarding the appellant's  visit  also  meant  there
was a further public interest consideration:

    "I also consider that  there  is  public  interest  in  preserving  the
    integrity of the immigration system and I do  believe  that  there  has
    been a degree of knowing abuse in this  application  which  is  evident
    from the timing of the decisions,  the  apparent  belief  that  it  was
    acceptable for the Appellant to spend nearly a year  in  the  UK  as  a
    visitor in a 12 month period providing she had left in the middle,  and
    from the inaccurate information that apparently found its  way  to  the
    Appellant's Doctor's letter" ([39].

13. Third, linked to this, the judge was not satisfied that the daughter  in
Canada took as little responsibility for her mother as was claimed. In  this
regard the judge noted that the  daughter  in  Canada  was  responsible  for
taking the appellant to and from the airport twice in two weeks in 2014  and
was involved in the decision for the appellant to return to  the  UK.  As  a
result the judge considered that the real situation would be that:

     "...in Canada the Appellant will have a  comparable  level  of  family
    life with the daughter, grandson  and  son-in-law  living  there  which
    mirrors the family life in the  UK  almost  exactly.  Further,  without
    evidence to specifically show that the Appellant  is  not  entitled  to
    health care or social support I find that many of her care needs  could
    be addressed in Canada which would make the experience of  leaving  the
    UK less traumatic."

14. A fourth factor noted by the judge concerned "the level of  family  life
and dependency that has been established in the UK". This,  the  judge  said
at [38], "has to be considered in the context of section 117B  of  the  2002
Act:

    "Whilst I have accepted factually a level of dependency  has  arisen  I
    note that this has arisen at a  time  when  the  Appellant's  leave  is
    properly regarded as precarious as she was here as a visitor  and  also
    because  I  believe  that  the  intention  was  for  the  Appellant  to
    effectively live here albeit only with status as a visitor. Accordingly
    I am required to attach less weight to the family life in the UK."

15. Fifth, the judge  considered  at  [40]  that  although  the  appellant's
family in the UK have significant means with her son-in-law earning  �45,000
a year (which was "to the family's credit"):

    "I am not satisfied that they have  shown  that  they  have  the  means
    necessary to cover all medical costs for the remainder of her  life.  I
    consider that there is a significant chance that she will need to  have
    recourse to public funds in the future and there is a potential risk to
    the public purse. "

The appellant's grounds of appeal

16. The grounds of appeal mount two  principal  challenges  to  the  judge's
decision.

17. The first challenge focuses on the judge's assessment of the content  of
the appellant's family life ties in Canada and the UK respectively.  It  was
argued that  in  finding  that  in  Canada  the  appellant  would  enjoy  "a
comparable level of family life", the judge  ignored  the  evidence  of  the
daughter in Canada's inability to care  for  her  mother  due  to  having  a
severely autistic son. It was argued that the  fact  that  the  daughter  in
Canada was able to drive her mother to and from the airport was not a  sound
basis for concluding that she would be able to provide  the  required  level
of care on a long term basis. In developing this point, Mr  Davidson  argued
that since in Canada the appellant was living on her own the judge  was  not
comparing like with like. The appellant's family life  in  the  UK  had  far
greater content and substance.  Further, it  was  the  appellant's  evidence
and that of her witnesses that her  family  had  not  been  able  to  access
social service care in Canada, so although there may be a  health  and  care
system there, she could not access it. The above finding was  also  said  to
ignore the impact that the appellant's proposed removal would  have  on  the
human rights of her family in the UK "and in particular the fact  that  they
would not have a comparable level of family life with the appellant  if  she
were removed from the country (Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39)". The  judge  was
also said to have erred in  not  recognising  that  any  relocation  of  the
appellant's family in the UK to Canada would  be  unreasonable  because  the
appellant's grandson was a British citizen. The failure to conduct  such  an
assessment was "consequently a highly material error of law".

18. The second main ground takes issue with the judge's approach  to  s.117B
of the 2002 Act. It is submitted that the judge erred  in  stating  at  [38]
that he was obliged under s.117B of the 2002 to attach less  weight  to  the
appellant's family life with her UK-based family because it was  established
at a time when her immigration status was precarious. That was  said  to  be
erroneous because s.117B(4) and (5) only  required  "little  weight"  to  be
given in two contexts only: where there was a  private  life  (s.117B(4)(a),
s117B(5)); and where there was a  relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner
(s.117B(4)(b)). The precariousness criteria applied  only  to  private  life
cases and not to family life cases and hence "the judge was wrong to use  it
to undermine the value of a family life that  was  developed  during  lawful
residence in the UK".  Mr  Davidson  sought  to  elaborate  this  ground  by
pointing out that since the  private  life  provisions  of  the  Immigration
Rules accepted that a person who had lived in the  UK  for  20  years  could
qualify on the basis of length of residence, the "little weight"  provisions
found in s.117B could not be an absolute rule.

19. In response to these grounds, Mr Bramble maintained that the  judge  was
entitled to arrive at the findings of fact which underlay his assessment  of
the appellant's likely circumstances on  return  to  Canada  and  the  judge
clearly did not accept that her daughter there played the very minimal  role
portrayed. The judge did not ignore the appellant's  circumstances;  it  was
just that he assessed them to be different from what had been  claimed;  the
challenge to this part of the judge's findings was really  no  more  than  a
disagreement with the facts as found. As regards  the  judge's  reliance  on
s.117B considerations, even if he was wrong to rely on these,  because  they
did not cover family life, the considerations set out in that  section  were
not  exhaustive  and  it  was  an  undoubted  fact  that   the   appellant's
immigration status in the UK was precarious.

Relevant case law

20. In Kaur (visit appeals; Article 8) [2015]  UKUT  487  (IAC))  the  Upper
Tribunal stated that:

    "In visit appeals the Article 8 decision on an appeal cannot be made in
    a vacuum. Whilst judges only have jurisdiction to  decide  whether  the
    decision is unlawful under s.6 of the Human Rights Act 1998  (or  shows
    unlawful discrimination) (see Mostafa (Article 8  in  entry  clearance)
    [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC ) and Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015]  UKUT
    261 (IAC)), the starting-point for deciding that must be the  state  of
    the evidence about the appellant's ability to meet the requirements  of
    paragraph 41 of the immigration rules.
    Unless an appellant can show that there  are  individual  interests  at
    stake covered by Article 8 "of a particularly pressing nature" so as to
    give rise to a "strong claim that compelling circumstances may exist to
    justify the grant of LTE [Leave to Enter] outside the rules":  (see  SS
    (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at [40] and [56]) he or she is  exceedingly
    unlikely to succeed. That proposition must also hold  good  in  visitor
    appeals."


21. As regards s.117A-D, there is  now  a  considerable  body  of  case  law
bearing on several key matters arising in  this  appeal.  As  noted  at  the
outset, the full text of ss.117A-D is set out in an Appendix.

22. As regards the meaning and effect of the "little weight"  provisions  of
s.117B(4)-(5), the Upper Tribunal stated in Deelah and others (section  117B
- ambit) (Rev 1) [2015] UKUT 515 (IAC) that:

    "Section 117B(4) and (5) of the 2002  Act,  which  instruct  Judges  to
    attribute "little weight" to the considerations specified  therein,  do
    not give rise to a constitutionally impermissible encroachment  on  the
    independent adjudicative function of the judiciary".

23. In Treebhawon and others (section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT  674  (IAC))  the
Upper Tribunal said that:

    "The two " little weight" provisions of section  117B  do  not  readily
    satisfy the appellation  of  Parliamentary  statements  of  the  public
    interest, in view of the terms in which they are phrased  and  compared
    with the formulation of the public interest statements  in  subsections
    (2), (3) and (6).  Furthermore,  the  two  "little  weight"  provisions
    relate to matters  which,  in  practice,  are  invoked  by  the  person
    concerned, rather than the Secretary of State, namely  a  private  life
    and/or a relationship formed with  a  qualifying  partner  during  such
    person's sojourn in the United Kingdom. As noted in  Deelah,  at  [21],
    the focus  of  these  discrete  statutory  provisions  is  choices  and
    decisions which have been made by the person or  persons  concerned  in
    their lives and lifestyles. We consider that section  117B(4)  and  (5)
    contain a recognition that the factors therein sound on the question of
    proportionality,  where   they   arise,   but   are,   by   unambiguous
    Parliamentary direction, to  be  accorded  little  weight.  We  further
    consider that, properly construed, section  117B(4)  and  (5)  are  not
    Parliamentary statements of the  public  interest.  They  are,  rather,
    Parliamentary instructions to courts and tribunals, to  be  applied  in
    the balancing exercise, that little  weight  should  be  given  to  the
    matters specified where relevant. Thus analysed, the  function  of  the
    court or tribunal concerned is not  simply  to  have  regard  to  these
    factors, in cases where they arise. Rather, they must be considered and
    given little weight. This is in contrast with the  classic  public  law
    case whereby the decision maker, having discharged the primary duty  of
    identifying all relevant facts and considerations, is free to accord to
    these such weight as he rationally considers appropriate."



 24. As regards the meaning of "precarious in s.117B(5) ("Little weight  is
to be given to a private life established by a person at  a  time  when  the
person's immigration status is precarious"), the Upper Tribunal said  in  AM
(S.117B) [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) that:

    "Parliament has now drawn a sharp distinction  between  any  period  of
    time during which a person has been in the  UK  "unlawfully",  and  any
    period of time during which that person's immigration status in the  UK
    was merely "precarious"( AM (S.117B) [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC)).


    Those who at any given date held a precarious immigration  status  must
    have held at that date an otherwise lawful grant of leave to  enter  or
    to remain. A person's  immigration  status  is  "precarious"  if  their
    continued presence in the UK will be dependent upon their  obtaining  a
    further grant of leave.


    In some circumstances it may also be that even a person with indefinite
    leave to remain, or a person who has  obtained  citizenship,  enjoys  a
    status that is "precarious" either because that status is revocable  by
    the Secretary of State as a result of their deception,  or  because  of
    their criminal conduct. In such circumstances the person will  be  well
    aware that he  has  imperilled  his  status  and  cannot  viably  claim
    thereafter that his status is other than precarious."

25. In Deelah the Upper Tribunal said that:

    " The adjective "precarious" in section 117B(5) of the 2002  Act  does
    not contemplate only, and is not restricted to, temporary admission  to
    the United Kingdom or a grant of leave to remain in  a  category  which
    permits no expectation of a further grant."


27. As regards the concept of "private life", the same Tribunal added  that:


    "A private life "established", in the wording and  in  the  context  of
    section 117B(4) and (5) of the 2002 Act, is  not  to  be  construed  as
    confined to the  initiation,  or  creation,  of  the  private  life  in
    question but extends to its continuation or development."




Our analysis

The appellant's family life circumstances

26. We find the first main ground of appeal is not made out.   It  is  clear
from the judge's assessment that  having  considered  the  entirety  of  the
evidence, including the witness  statements,  the  oral  testimony  and  the
medical evidence, the judge was not satisfied that the family  had  given  a
truthful account of the appellant's circumstances  in  Canada.  Mr  Davidson
has sought to argue that the judge simply arrived at this conclusion by  way
of a "quantum leap" from the finding that  the  appellant's  older  daughter
took her to and from the airport on the occasion of her last,  quite  short,
period of time in Canada. But it is clear that the judge's reliance  on  the
role of the daughter in Canada taking the appellant to and from the  airport
was only one of the considerations taken into account.  At  [28]  the  judge
noted that this daughter was also involved in the decision to send her  back
to the UK. At [29] the judge also noted the  family's  account  differed  in
certain respects with that which the appellant had given to the  doctor  (Dr
Sivakumar)  who  had  written  a  letter  of  7  May   2014.   Among   other
inconsistencies, the doctor's letter said  that  the  appellant  was  living
alone in Vancouver for "few months after her daughter migrated  to  the  UK"
whereas "[i]n fact on the account before me the Appellant  was  on  her  own
for a year prior to her first visit to the UK" ([30]). We fully concur  with
Mr Bramble in regarding this ground of  challenge  as  a  mere  disagreement
with adequately reasoned findings of fact.

27. As regards the precise situation of the appellant in Canada in terms  of
available care, it is clear  that  at  the  hearing  before  the  judge  the
appellant's counsel did not seek to dispute that  in  Canada  there  was  an
effective functioning public health care  system  and  a  system  of  social
care. The appellant's grounds of appeal do not contain any  request  to  re-
examine that concession or any background country evidence  indicating  that
Canada lacked such a functioning system. Even if (as Mr  Davidson  contends)
there was some evidence that the appellant in particular  could  not  access
social services, the family's own evidence was that they had taken steps  to
obtain private care for her and we note that prior to the  appellant  coming
to the UK her daughter and son-in-law here had  financially  supported  her.
We also note  that  according  to  the  appellant's  witness  statement  the
daughter in Canada had a husband who was  employed  as  a  Customer  Service
assistant at a gas station in Vancouver. When the  appellant  lived  in  Sri
Lanka the older daughter regularly sent money  for  the  appellant  and  her
younger sister's upkeep but then decided to  call  her  and  her  sister  to
Canada. Further, after  her  younger  daughter  left  Canada  the  appellant
continued to live at the same address. In addition, although  the  appellant
and her family described the  appellant  as  living  on  her  own  once  her
younger daughter departed for the UK, her own witness statement said it  was
"with the houseowner's family".

28. In light of this body of evidence it was entirely open to the FtT  judge
to conclude that the appellant would receive  adequate  care  on  return  to
Canada, whether provided by Canadian authorities, by private means  financed
by the daughters or by  the  appellant's  older  daughter  in  Canada  or  a
combination of these.

29. We accept that the judge was not strictly correct to describe the  level
of care the appellant would receive in Canada as  "comparable"  even  though
he had found that the elder daughter  there  had  been  and  would  be  more
involved in the appellant's care than was claimed. On the evidence  accepted
by the judge the care the appellant has  been  receiving  from  her  younger
daughter and her family in the UK was of a higher quality  and  that  is  no
doubt one reason why her family has  assisted  her  in  her  application  to
remain. But the fact that her level of care in the UK was and would be of  a
better quality does not demonstrate any error of law  on  the  part  of  the
judge in finding that it would not be disproportionate for the appellant  to
be required to return to Canada, on the basis that she would  and  could  be
adequately be cared for by a combination of care  from  the  elder  daughter
and private care, bolstered by financial support by way of remittances  sent
by her younger daughter and her husband, as before. The  judge  was  clearly
entitled to consider that returning her to such a  situation  would  not  be
disproportionate.

30. As regards the suggestion that the judge failed  to  take  into  account
the family life of the appellant's daughter and son-in-law and  grandson  in
the UK, we fail to see that this was the  case.  When  concluding  that  the
appellant enjoyed family life in the UK, the judge was clearly impressed  by
the level of care the appellant received in the UK and of the  closeness  of
her ties with her younger daughter and family, including  her  grandson.  We
do not understand the decision of the  House  of  Lords  in  Beoku-Betts  to
assist  the  appellant,  as  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  situation   being
considered in that case, the appellant is someone who had come to the UK  as
a visitor, had only been here for a short period and had no  expectation  of
being able to succeed under the Immigration Rules for  dependants.  Nor  had
she made any application  under  the  "carer"  provisions  of  the  Rules  -
probably because she clearly failed to meet their requirements.

31. We mention at this point that we see no merit  in  the  contention  that
the judge erred in not considering and concluding that the daughter and  her
family in the UK could not reasonably relocate to Canada to look  after  the
appellant there. That had never been suggested as a  possible  scenario  and
the judge's finding that there would be sufficient care in  Canada  was  not
dependent on any such finding.

The "little weight" provisions of ss.117B(4)(a) and (5)

32. In respect of the second main ground, we would first  observe  that  the
s117B(4)(a) and (5) considerations dealing with "private life" do  not  seek
to address every type of situation pertaining to  a person's  private  life,
only to "private life...that is established at a time when the person is  in
the United Kingdom unlawfully" (s117B(4)(a))  or  "...at  a  time  when  the
person's immigration status is precarious" (s117B(5)).

33. It is next to be observed that whether Mr Davidson is right to say  that
the "little  weight"  provisions  found  in  s.117B(4)  and  (5)  impose  no
"absolute" rule depends on what is meant by "absolute".  If  he  means  that
they are not obligatory in character we cannot agree with him. As the  Upper
Tribunal has made plain in a  number  of  decisions,  these  provisions  are
among a series of mandatory considerations: see for example,  Dube (ss.117A-
117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC)) and  Forman (ss  117A-C  considerations)  [2015]
UKUT 412 (IAC)).

34. If however Mr Davidson means only to draw attention  to  the  fact  that
these and other provisions are not  exhaustive,  we  would  entirely  agree.
That is certainly correct: see for example, Dube,  Forman.  Sections  117A-D
considerations can only be a starting point.

35. Mr Davidson's point that  the  provisions  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iii)
dealing with persons over 25 years old reflect a view that  after  20  years
such persons' private life can in  certain  circumstances  be  taken  to  be
"weighty" enough to warrant eligibility on  grounds  of  long  residence  is
correct, but what the Secretary  of  State  decides  to  impose  by  way  of
requirements under the Rules is a matter for her:  see  Bossade  (ss.117A-D-
interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 415 (IAC). So far as concerns  the
scope of ss.117A-D considerations as applied in an appeal based  on  Article
8 grounds outside the Rules, we are bound by statute and  the  statute  does
not time-limit its "little weight" provisions. Further, as just  noted,  the
considerations set out in ss.117A-D  are  non-exhaustive.  Hence   any  case
brought outside the Rules involving a person aged 25 or over with  20  years
or more private life in the UK would likely have other features  that  would
make the proportionality assessment of the "public  interest"  question  (as
defined in s.117A (3)) one that had regard to a wide range of factors.

36. The second observation we would make is that although ss.117B-C  do  not
in terms refer anywhere to  "family  life"  their  subject-matter  certainly
touches on some considerations that quintessentially pertain to family  life
within the meaning of Article 8. Section 117(4)(a) concerns "a  relationship
begun with a qualifying partner that is established by a person  at  a  time
when the person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully"; s117B(6) concerns "  a
genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying child"; and  s117C((5)
concerns "a genuine and subsisting relationship with a  qualifying  partner,
or a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a  qualifying  child..."
Further, there are a number of considerations in  s.117B(1)-(3)  which  have
potential application not just to "private life" cases but to "family  life"
cases as well.  In the above ways, courts and  tribunals  applying  ss117B-C
will often be applying considerations  that  are  inherently  about  "family
life".

37. That said, there is no  specific  provision  in  s117B(4)  and  (5)  for
"family life" relationships other  than  those  specifically  identified  as
above. Yet it is  uncontroversial  that  in  Article  8  jurisprudence,  the
meaning of "family life" can extend in  certain  circumstances  to  include,
inter alia,  relationships  between  adults  and  between  grandparents  and
grandchildren: see e.g. Kugathas [2003]  EWCA  Civ  31,  JB  (India)  v  ECO
[2009] 234, AAO v ECO [2011] EWCA Civ 840.

38. But this lack does not mean that family life relationships  outwith  the
scope of s.117B and s117B are to be  ignored.  As  noted  earlier,  ss117A-D
considerations are  inexhaustive and courts and  tribunals  are  obliged  by
ss117A (2)-(3) to apply such considerations in the context of answering  the
wider "pubic interest" question defined  as  "the  question  of  whether  an
interference with a person's right to respect for private  and  family  life
is justified under Article 8(2)." In logic other considerations may well  be
pertinent  to  answering  that  question.  Notably,   s117A   contains   two
references to family life, both coupling it with  "private  life":  s117A(a)
which identifies the material scope of ss117A-D as  being  determination  of
whether a decision made under the  Immigration  Acts  "breaches  a  person's
right to respect for private and family life under Article 8"; and  s117A(3)
which defines "the public  interest  question"  to  mean  "the  question  of
whether an interference with a person's right to  respect  for  private  and
family life is justified under Article 8(2)."  In  logic  as  well,  when  a
court or tribunal is seeking to answer the  "public  interest  question"  it
must apply established Article 8 jurisprudence. Sections 117A-D  should  not
be understood as in any way releasing judges from adherence to  the  binding
authority of our higher courts on the subject of Article 8.

39. It follows that when answering the "public interest question"  posed  by
s117A(2)-(3) a court of tribunal should  not  disregard  "precarious  family
life" criteria set out in established Article  8  jurisprudence.  Indeed  in
certain cases, given that ss.117A-D considerations are  not  exhaustive,  it
may be an error of law for a court or tribunal to disregard  such  criteria.
The proportionality assessment involved is capable of cutting two  ways.  It
may  be  in  certain  cases   that   relevant   extraneous   "family   life"
considerations will strengthen an applicant's Article  8  claim  as  regards
the question of proportionality. For example it may  be  that  an  applicant
who is caring for orphaned grandchildren will be able to show the  existence
of very compelling family life reasons for being allowed to  remain  in  the
UK.  In other cases, however, extraneous "family  life"  considerations  may
weaken, at least in some respects, an applicant's Article 8 claim. One  such
example might be where the applicant's family life has been  established  or
altered in character at a time when the applicant's  immigration  status  is
precarious.

40. That "precariousness" is a criterion of  relevance  to  family  life  as
well  as  private  life  cases  is  an  established  part   of   Article   8
jurisprudence: see the observations by Sales J (as he  then  was)  at  [38]-
[43] in Nagre  on what he called (at [42])"precarious  family  life"  cases.
At [41] he summarised the position as being that:


    "The approach explained in the Strasbourg case-law indicates that where
    family life is established when the immigration status of the  claimant
    is precarious, removal will be  disproportionate  only  in  exceptional
    cases..."


41. More recently the Grand Chamber in the case of Jeunesse  v  Netherlands,
app.no.12738/10, 3 October 2014 has reaffirmed at [108] that:

    "108. Another  important  consideration  is  whether  family  life  was
    created at a time  when  the  persons  involved  were  aware  that  the
    immigration status of one of them was such that the persistence of that
    family life within the host State would from the outset be  precarious.
    It is the Court's well-established case-law that,  where  this  is  the
    case, it is likely only to be in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the
    removal of the non-national family member will constitute  a  violation
    of Article 8 (see Abdulaziz,  Cabales  and  Balkandali  v.  the  United
    Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985,  Series  A  no.  94,  p.  94,  �  68;
    Mitchell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 40447/98, 24 November  1998;
    Ajayi and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no.  27663/95,  22  June
    1999; M. v. the United Kingdom (dec.),  no.  25087/06,  24  June  2008;
    Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands, cited above, � 39;
    Arvelo Aponte v. the Netherlands, cited above, �� 57-58;  and  Butt  v.
    Norway, cited above, � 78)."

42. It must also  be  recalled  that  there  is  no  support  in  Article  8
jurisprudence for reading the two concepts "private life" and "family  life"
as mutually exclusive. It has long been accepted that the Article 8  concept
of private life is of broad scope: see, inter  alia,   Nhundu  and  Chiwera,
IAT [2001] 01/TH/1603. Indeed the Strasbourg Court has made clear that  even
if relationships between family members do  not  qualify  as  "family  life"
they still require to be assessed fully under the rubric of "private  life".
Thus in AA v UK, app.no.8000/08, 20 September 2011, the  Fourth  Section  of
the ECtHR noted that:

    "49.  An examination of the Court's case-law would tend to suggest that
    the applicant, a young adult of 24 years  old,  who  resides  with  his
    mother and has not yet founded a family of his own, can be regarded  as
    having "family life". However,  it  is  not  necessary  to  decide  the
    question given that, as Article 8 also protects the right to  establish
    and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world
    and can sometimes embrace aspects of an individual's  social  identity,
    it must be accepted that the totality of social  ties  between  settled
    migrants and the community in which they are living constitutes part of
    the concept of "private life" within the meaning of  Article  8.  Thus,
    regardless of the existence  or  otherwise  of  a  "family  life",  the
    expulsion of a settled migrant constitutes  an  interference  with  his
    right to respect for private  life.  While  the  Court  has  previously
    referred to the need to decide in the circumstances of  the  particular
    case before it whether it is appropriate  to  focus  on  "family  life"
    rather than "private life", it observes that in practice the factors to
    be examined in order to assess the proportionality of  the  deportation
    measure are the same regardless of whether family or  private  life  is
    engaged (�ner, cited above, �� 57-60)."

43. Turning to the judge's treatment of the appellant's case, it is  not  in
dispute that the appellant's immigration status in the UK  has  always  been
and remains precarious: even when she was admitted as a visitor, her  leave,
being limited in time to a maximum  of  12  months  and  for  the  temporary
purpose of a visit, is unarguably precarious: see again, inter alia, AM  and
Deelaah and others.

44. It is fair to say that at [38] the  judge'  failed  to  show  a  precise
appreciation of the ambit of s117B. At [38] he stated:

    "I find that the level of family life  and  dependency  that  has  been
    established in the UK has to be considered in the  context  of  section
    117B of the 2002 [Act}. Whilst I have accepted  factually  a  level  of
    dependency has arisen I note that this has arisen at a  time  when  the
    Appellant's leave is properly regarded as precarious as she was here as
    a visitor and also because I believe that the  intention  was  for  the
    Appellant to effectively  live  here  albeit  only  with  status  as  a
    visitor. Accordingly I am required to attach less weight to the  family
    life in the UK".

45. As we have seen s.117B(4)(a) and (5) do not  in  fact  "require"  little
[or to use the judge's term "less"] weight to be given  to  family  life  in
the UK. At least in a case such  as  the  appellant's  (which  was  not  one
concerned with genuine and  subsisting  relationships  between  partners  or
children), s11B(4)(a) and (5) are silent about "family life".

46. However, we cannot see that this error was  in  any  way  material.  The
judge's assessment began at [25] with  a  self-reminder  that  he  was  only
concerned with a claim on Article 8 grounds outside the  Rules  and  earlier
at [8] he had set out  case law dealing with such claims,  including  Nagre.
Having addressed the nature of the appellant's family life circumstances  in
[30]-[33], the judge then said that he turned to the  5  stage  Razgar  test
and stated that he accepted that the appellant's family life ties in the  UK
engaged Article 8. In [35]-[37] the judge identified  a  number  of  factors
bearing on the assessment of whether the interference with  the  appellant's
private and family life ties would  be  proportionate  or  not.   What  then
follows in  [38]-40]  is  clearly  an  ongoing  assessment  of  the  "public
interest" question having regard to private and family life.

47. Also indicative of the fact that the judge's primary focus  was  on  the
wider  "public  interest"  question  conceived  of   as   encompassing   the
appellant's private and family life (not just private  life)  was  what  the
judge said at [40]:

    "In terms of proportionality I do note that the Appellant's  family  in
    the UK have significant means with her  son-in-law  earning  �45,000  a
    year. This is to the family's credit but I am not satisfied  that  they
    have shown that they have the means  necessary  to  cover  all  medical
    costs for the remainder of  her  life.  I  consider  that  there  is  a
    significant chance that she will need to have recourse to public  funds
    in the future  and  there  is  potential  risk  to  the  public  purse.
    Assessing all the facts in  the  case  I  find  that  the  interference
    represented by the refusal of  leave  is  proportionate  and  that  the
    Appellant is not entitled to remain in the UK".

48. The wording of this paragraph strongly suggests that the  judge  had  in
mind section 117B(3) which sets out that  "[i]t is in the  public  interest,
and in particular it is in the interests of the economic well-being  of  the
United Kingdom, that persons who seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United
Kingdom are financially independent because such persons -  (a)  are  not  a
burden on the taxpayer".  As  explained  earlier,  s117B  is  one  of  three
considerations set out in s117B that apply without  distinction  to  private
and family life-based claims.

49. But even  if  it  were  thought  that  the  judge's  reasoning  in  this
paragraph strayed beyond the scope of s.117B(3) by talking  not  just  about
"a burden on taxpayers" but  more  broadly  about  "potential  risk  to  the
public purse", that was entirely consonant with Article 8  jurisprudence  on
private and family life in cases where there is a cost to the public  purse:
see e.g. Konstatinov v The Netherlands, App. 16351/03,  ECtHR,  judgment  of
26 April 2007.

50. For the above reasons:

The First-tier Tribunal  judge  did  not  materially  err  in  law  and  his
decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal must stand.

                                  Appendix

Sections 117A-D of the 2002 Act


 [Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014 introduced  into  the  Nationality
 Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 a new Part 5A, headed "Article  8  of  the
 ECHR: Public Interest Considerations". These new provisions are set out in
 sections 117A-D of the 2002 Act, which were brought into effect on 28 July
 2014 pursuant to Article 3 of The Immigration Act 2014 (Commencement No 1,
 Transitory and Saving Provisions) Order 2014] Sections 117A-D  provide  as
 follows;


 117A Application of this Part
 (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required  to  determine
    whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
    (a) breaches a person's right to respect for private  and  family  life
       under Article 8, and
    (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the  Human  Rights
       Act 1998.
 (2) In considering the public interest question,  the  court  or  tribunal
    must (in particular) have regard-
    (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B, and
    (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,  to  the
       considerations listed in section 117C.
 (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the  question
    of whether an interference with a person's right to respect for private
    and family life is justified under Article 8(2).


 117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases
 (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the  public
    interest.
 (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests  of
    the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
    enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are  able  to  speak  English,
    because persons who can speak English-
    (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
    (b) are better able to integrate into society.
 (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests  of
    the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
    enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are  financially  independent,
    because such persons-
    (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
    (b) are better able to integrate into society.
 (4) Little weight should be given to-
    (a) a private life, or
    (b)  a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying  partner,   that   is
       established by a person at a time when the person is in  the  United
       Kingdom unlawfully.
 (5) Little weight should be given to  a  private  life  established  by  a
    person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
 (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the  public
    interest does not require the person's removal where-
    (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship  with
       a qualifying child, and
    (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the  United
       Kingdom.


 117D Interpretation of this Part
 (1)   In this Part -
    "Article 8" means Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights;
    "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age of 18 and who -
      (a)   is a British citizen, or,
      (b)   has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven
        years or more
 "qualifying partner" means a partner who -
      (a)   is a British citizen, or,
      (b)   who is settled in the United Kingdom (within the meaning of  the
        Immigration Act 1971 - see section 33(2A) of that Act.
