                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh, was successful  in  her  appeal
    before the First-tier Tribunal against  the  respondent's  decision  to
    refuse her entry clearance to join her spouse, who is working as a chef
    in the United Kingdom.  The respondent appealed to the  Upper  Tribunal
    and the appeal was  heard  on  16  July  2015.   The  Upper  Tribunal's
    decision has not yet been promulgated.

 2. On 17 August 2015, the  Upper  Tribunal  received  a  letter  from  the
    appellant's  sponsor  husband,  withdrawing  his  sponsorship  for  the
    appellant's application, as the parties  intended  to  submit  a  fresh
    application  shortly  together.   He  stated  that  he  had  given  his
    solicitors instructions not to pursue this application further.   On  1
    September 2015, the Upper Tribunal wrote to the husband,  stating  that
    the appellant herself must withdraw her appeal.  On  6  September  2015
    the solicitors confirmed those instructions, stating that  the  parties
    intended instead to lodge a fresh application for entry  clearance  for
    her as the partner of a  person  present  and  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom, and confirming that their retainer in this appeal  was  at  an
    end.

 3. On 15 September 2015, and again  by  fax  on  20  September  2015,  the
    appellant herself confirmed that she did not wish to proceed with  this
    application.  She said, 'I don't want to continue this file  because  I
    apply a new file last month, so please close my all of case'.  That  is
    clear beyond any doubt.  The appellant wishes to withdraw her challenge
    to the underlying decision.  She  also  wishes  to  withdraw  her  case
    before the Upper Tribunal,  in  relation  to  the  respondent's  appeal
    against the First-tier Tribunal decision.

 4. Pursuant to paragraph 17 of The  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (as amended),  the  permission  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    required for the Upper Tribunal withdrawal. The  Tribunal  consents  to
    that withdrawal.

 5. This Notice is to inform the parties that the appellant's appeal before
    the First-tier Tribunal and her case before the  Upper  Tribunal  stand
    withdrawn.

 6. The respondent's appeal is therefore dismissed.
