For the Appellant: Miss A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr I Khan, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Parties and Proceedings

    1. The appellant in this appeal is the entry clearance  officer  (ECO).
       The respondent, Mrs Koli Begum, is  referred  to  hereafter  as  the
       claimant.  She was born on 20th November 1989 and is a  national  of
       Bangladesh.  She appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
       decision of the ECO,  made  on  6th  January  2013,  to  refuse  her
       application for entry clearance as a spouse to join the sponsor,  Mr
       Muzibur Rahman, under the provisions of EC-P.1.1 (d)  and  E-ECP.3.1
       of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


    2. In  a  determination  promulgated  on  28th  March  2014  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Fletcher-Hill (the Judge) allowed  the  appeal  under
       the eligibility requirements of the Immigration  Rules  at  EC-P.1.1
       (d) and the financial requirements at  E-ECP.3.1.  of  Appendix  FM.
       Permission to appeal to Upper Tribunal Upper was  initially  refused
       to the ECO but was subsequently  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
       Southern on 9th June 2014 for the reason that each  of  the  grounds
       arguably identifies errors of law in the determination.


    3. The matter accordingly came before me  for  an  initial  hearing  to
       determine whether the making  of  the  decision  in  the  First-tier
       Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of law.


Consideration of Issues and Submissions


    4. The claimant made this application on 18th  October  2012.  The  ECO
       considered the requirement for her sponsor to show a gross income of
       at least �18,600 per annum in order to meet the necessary  financial
       requirements of the Immigration Rules. He found that a P60, payslips
       for a 6-month period in relation to employment with Do and Co  Event
       and Airline Catering and a  contract  of  employment  had  not  been
       provided;  there  was  no  explanation  for  the  absence  of  these
       specified documents.  However, the ECO  accepted  from  checks  with
       HMRC that the sponsor's income for 2011/2012 was �18,586.


    5. The claimant indicated that the  sponsor  had  secondary  employment
       with Shahid Limited but the only supporting evidence consisted of  4
       payslips.  There was no contract of employment and no evidence  that
       the funds of �58.56 per week claimed to be from this employment  had
       been received. The ECO found a lack of  the  necessary  evidence  to
       show the sponsor's income in accordance  with  Appendix  FM-SE;  his
       bank account did not show  regular  deposits  matching  the  claimed
       income from Shahid Limited.  The application  was  refused  and  was
       upheld on review by an entry clearance manager  (ECM)  on  4th  July
       3013. The ECM found a continuing  lack  of  supporting  evidence  to
       comply with Appendix FM-SE.


    6. At the hearing on 10th January 2014 the Judge  heard  evidence  from
       the sponsor whom she found to be a credible witness. She allowed the
       appeal in relation to the financial requirements having  found  that
       the sponsor's income of �18,586 for the year ending 5th  April  2012
       from his main employment came to �14 less that the  required  annual
       gross income.  For the tax year ending 5th April 2013 the  sponsor's
       P60 from his main employment showed a sum of �18,364.58 and the  P45
       from his secondary employment, which was dated 13th  December  2012,
       showed an additional �1,034.64  earned  from  September  -  December
       2012.


    7. The Judge found that one payslip for May 2012 was still missing  but
       she found the bank statements now submitted for the  6-month  period
       before the application, which was made on 18th October 2012,  showed
       the sponsor's income for that month. The Judge  found  that  at  the
       date of decision, on 6th  January  2013,  the  sponsor  was  earning
       �19,000 per annum taking account of a salary increase from his  main
       employer from 1st January 2013, as  confirmed  at  page  37  of  the
       appellant's bundle of documents, and therefore  5  days  before  the
       date of decision.


    8. In submissions before me Miss Everett relied  upon  the  grounds  of
       appeal for the ECO stating that the Judge had  materially  erred  in
       law because the relevant date for Appendix FM is that of application
       and the specified evidence is required for the  period  before  that
       date. The Judge had, however, not limited his considerations to  the
       evidence prior to the date of application but had taken  account  of
       evidence  the  sponsor's  increase  in  salary  after  the  date  of
       application, namely 5 days before the date of decision.   The  Judge
       is submitted to have paid insufficient regard to the requirements of
       FM-SE, to the type and format of evidence required  and  the  period
       for which that evidence is required.


    9. The findings of the Judge were accordingly submitted by Miss Everett
       to be unsustainable because of the lack of specified evidence at the
       date of decision for the relevant period; there is a timeline  which
       is the date of application. The Judge should not have considered the
       secondary employment with Shahid Limited which lasted for less  than
       6 months prior to the application; it started in September 2012  and
       finished in December 2012.  The Judge was obviously  sympathetic  to
       the appellant and sponsor, but if the sponsor's income  subsequently
       exceeded the necessary threshold the appropriate  course  of  action
       was submitted to be for the claimant to make a fresh application.


   10. In reply to these submissions Mr Khan for the claimant relied on his
       submitted  Rule  24  response  opposing  the  appeal  in  the  Upper
       Tribunal.   He  argued  that  section  85A   of   the   Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 gives power to the Tribunal  to  use
       its  discretion  to  consider  in  entry   clearance   matters   the
       circumstances appertaining at the time of  decision.   He  submitted
       that even if the Judge considered the relevant date to  be  that  of
       the decision, that power or discretion was given to the Tribunal  by
       Parliament.  He submitted that the Rules of Appendix  FM  contradict
       substantive law on entry clearance matters.


   11. Mr Khan submitted that it was open to the Judge to consider all  the
       evidence before her; she was entitled to find the  decision  of  the
       ECO, as she did, to be  not  in  accordance  with  the  law  or  the
       Immigration Rules because flexibility  and  discretion  should  have
       been applied to the application so that  the  claimant  should  have
       been given an opportunity to supply the  missing  information.   The
       sponsor's May 2012 payslip was  one  of  a  missing  sequence  which
       should have been requested before the application was  refused.  The
       Judge was entitled to take account  of  the  HMRC  evidence  of  the
       sponsor's second income as a circumstance appertaining at  the  time
       of the decision or in any event at the time of the application date.




   12. I announced my decision to the representatives that I found that the
       Judge had materially erred in law such  that  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal should be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision
       and invited submissions in relation to the remaking of the decision.
       Mr Khan's view that the matter should be remitted to the  First-tier
       Tribunal was not disputed by Miss Everett but I stated that  it  was
       my intention to remake the decision in the  Upper  Tribunal  without
       the need for further evidence.

   13. I was not satisfied that remittal was necessary in  accordance  with
       paragraph 7.2 the Practice Statements made by the  Senior  President
       of Tribunals; the effect of the error has  not  been  to  deprive  a
       party before the First-tier Tribunal of  a  fair  hearing  or  other
       opportunity for that party's case to be put to and considered by the
       First-tier Tribunal; nor does the nature or extent of  any  judicial
       fact finding necessary to remake the decision  warrant  remittal.  I
       accordingly heard further submissions from the  parties  as  to  the
       remaking of the decision which essentially echoed those put  forward
       in relation to the error  of  law  arguments.  I  reserved  my  full
       reasoning and final decision which are as follows.

   14. I find that the Judge appropriately directed herself at paragraph 13
       of the determination that that she should consider the circumstances
       at the date of decision, but she erred by failing to take account of
       the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  setting  out  the  specified
       evidence to show those circumstances. There is no inherent  conflict
       between these requirements. The wage slips had to cover a period  of
       6 months prior to the date of application but  they  did  not.   The
       Judge allowed the appeal notwithstanding the continuing  absence  of
       the May 2012 wage slip for the  sponsor's  primary  employment;  the
       period of secondary employment was for less than that  period  of  6
       months and should not have been taken into account.


   15. I find that the judge erred in taking account of evidence other than
       the specified evidence. I find  that  the  Judge  further  erred  by
       taking account of evidence of the sponsor's pay rise after the  date
       of application. The case of Raju and others v Secretary of State for
       the Home Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  754  is  authority  for  the
       proposition that there is no concept  of  a  continuing  application
       which starts when it is first submitted and concludes at the date of
       the decision, either of the Secretary of State or, on appeal,  of  a
       tribunal.  I accept the submission from Miss Everett that there is a
       timeline for this application and that is the date of application.


   16.  I do not accept that the  Judge  was,  as  submitted  by  Mr  Khan,
       entitled to find the ECO's decision other than  in  accordance  with
       the law for failure to apply an evidential flexibility policy.   The
       Judge makes no mention of a failure to apply such  a  policy  or  to
       request under the Rules one of a missing sequence of documents; this
       was  no  part  of  her  reasoning.  Any  duty  to  apply  evidential
       flexibility  is  discretionary  and  not  mandatory  and  there  was
       considerably more than one missing document or  payslip  before  the
       ECO at the date of decision;  there  was  no  P60  for  the  primary
       employment no contract of employment had been provided; there was no
       explanation for the absence of these  specified  documents  and  the
       sponsor's income for 2011/2012 was �18,586 and therefore  below  the
       threshold.


   17. Carrying forward my findings in relation to the error of law I  find
       that the claimant on the  date  of  decision  failed  to  show  with
       specified evidence that the sponsor's income reached  the  necessary
       threshold. The evidence which the Judge was entitled  to  take  into
       account before her in the First-tier Tribunal did not, and does not,
       show the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules to  be  met
       and I accordingly remake the decision by dismissing the appeal under
       the Immigration Rules.


   18. There was apparently no Article 8 submission before the Judge in the
       First-tier Tribunal and there were no such submissions to me for the
       purposes of remaking the decision. The claimant's grounds of  appeal
       in the First-tier Tribunal do, however,  contain  a  general  ground
       that the decision is a breach of the claimant's  ECHR  human  rights
       without further detail.  I  have  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
       Immigration  Rules  and  I  find  that  the  appeal  cannot  succeed
       alternatively under Article 8 of the ECHR, or otherwise on any human
       rights grounds.


   19. It is not submitted that the appellant comes within Article 8  under
       the Immigration Rules.  The case of Gulshan 2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)
       decided that a consideration of the nature and extent of the failure
       to meet the Rules must be a precursor to consideration of Article  8
       within the Rules and under the ECHR and only if there are  "arguably
       good grounds" for granting leave to remain outside the Rules was  it
       necessary for the Tribunal for  Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to
       consider   whether   there   are   "compelling   circumstances   not
       sufficiently recognised by the Rules".


   20. I find no arguably good  grounds  for  granting  leave  outside  the
       Rules.  No such grounds  are  identified  and  nor  do  I  find  any
       compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised by the Rules to
       warrant any further Article 8 ECHR consideration. The option remains
       open to the  claimant  to  make  a  renewed  application  under  the
       Immigration Rules with the  appropriate,  specified,  evidence.  The
       appeal is dismissed under Article 8 of the ECHR.

Summary of Decisions


   21. The making of the First-tier Tribunal decision involved  the  making
       of an error on a point of law.


   22. The decision is set aside and is remade as follows.


   23. The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.


   24. The appeal is dismissed under Article 8 of the ECHR.


   25. The ECO's appeal to the Upper Tribunal succeeds.

Anonymity


I find no reason to change the decision of the First-tier Tribunal not  make
an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
(Procedure) Rules 2005.
