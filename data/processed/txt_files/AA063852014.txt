                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal against  the  decision  and
    reasons statement of First-tier Tribunal K Brown that  was  promulgated
    on 11 November 2014.  Judge  Brown  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
    against the immigration decision  of  20  August  2014  to  remove  the
    appellant to Pakistan as an overstayer whose asylum  and  human  rights
    claim had been refused.

 2. Mr Sellwood relied on the grounds of  application,  which  argued  that
    Judge Brown had: (i) failed to make findings on  material  facts,  (ii)
    had made irrational findings on material matters, and (iii) misdirected
    himself in law.

 3. Mr Sellwood identified three key  points  that  underpinned  all  these
    issues.  First, the judge failed to give anxious scrutiny to all of the
    evidence.  He submitted that Judge Brown failed to assess  whether  the
    appellant had been the  victim  of  past  persecution  because  of  the
    beatings she claimed to have suffered from her  brother  and  ex-fianc�
    that resulted in a miscarriage.  The judge mentioned  the  incident  in
    paragraphs 14 and 36 but made not findings in relation  to  whether  he
    accepted the incident had occurred.   In  addition  he  did  not  given
    appropriate weight to the GP's  record  that  had  been  provided  that
    confirmed the incident.  In a similar vein,  Mr  Sellwood  reminded  me
    that the appellant's husband had been the victim of serious harm on two
    occasions in November/December 2007.   Although  Judge  Brown  recorded
    these incidents in paragraphs 14 and 34 he made no finding in  relation
    to the appellant's claim that they had been caused  by  her  ex-fianc�.
    Mr Sellwood submitted that it was  necessary  for  the  judge  to  make
    findings on whether the appellant and/or her  husband  had  experienced
    past persecution because, as per  paragraph  339K  of  the  immigration
    rules, past persecution is good evidence of likely future  risk  unless
    the country situation has changed materially.

 4. Mr Sellwood's second point  is  that  Judge  Brown  made  a  number  of
    irrational findings.  Mr Sellwood indicated that the judge  had  failed
    to consider the fact that a genuine refugee family might have to  leave
    at separate  times  because  of  the  nature  of  their  circumstances.
    Therefore, it was irrational for the judge to  have  drawn  an  adverse
    conclusion from the fact that the appellant's husband had left Pakistan
    before her.  In addition, Mr Sellwood said Judge Brown had ignored  the
    different cultural factors that are present in  Pakistani  society  and
    therefore could not draw the adverse inference he did in respect of the
    appellant not having encountered any difficulties from her  brother  or
    ex-fianc� whilst staying with her aunt and uncle.  In a similar way, Mr
    Sellwood sought to undermine Judge Brown's finding that  the  newspaper
    adverts were not reliable.  The judge had rejected the  reliability  of
    the adverts because it was not clear how the friend of the  appellant's
    husband had recognised their pictures.  Mr Sellwood  pointed  out  that
    the judge had failed to take account of the fact that the appellant and
    her husband had  stayed  for  some  months  with  the  friend  and  the
    appellant's name was  printed  underneath  the  pictures.   As  to  the
    irregularities in the death certificates, Mr Sellwood  argued  that  it
    was presumptuous to expect correct spelling in a country where  English
    was not a first language.

 5. The third factor relied on by Mr  Sellwood  relates  to  Judge  Brown's
    reliance on how plausible the  appellant's  account  appeared  to  him.
    There is substantial background country information to show that family
    disputes of the sort described by the appellant exist in  Pakistan  and
    that violence in such circumstances is not  uncommon.   Yet  the  judge
    rejects the appellant's account primarily on the basis that  she  could
    relocate, live discretely and give up any rights to  property.   In  so
    doing, Judge Brown has avoided answering the question  of  whether  the
    appellant would be at risk of persecution in Pakistan.

 6. Mr Kandola replied by arguing that  Judge  Brown's  assessment  of  the
    appellant's credibility was accurate.  He found that the appellant  was
    not to be generally believed.  The grounds of appeal were, in his view,
    mere disagreement with the judicial findings.  The judge had considered
    all of the arguments presented, including  cultural  factors,  and  had
    reached reasoned  conclusions  which  were  sustainable.   Judge  Brown
    analysed not only the appellant's accounts  but  also  the  documentary
    evidence.  He gave good reasons for finding the  documents  not  to  be
    reliable  given  that  there  was  inconsistent  evidence  about  their
    provenance.  Mr Kandola also submitted that even if  there  were  minor
    errors in the assessment of credibility, the appellant and  her  family
    had a viable internal flight alternative and therefore the  outcome  of
    the appeal would have been the same.

 7. As I indicated at the end of the hearing I find against  the  appellant
    because I am satisfied  there  is  no  legal  error  in  Judge  Brown's
    decision and reasons statement.  I reserved my  reasons,  which  I  now
    give.

 8. I am satisfied that the appellant's  arguments  are  mere  disagreement
    with the judicial  findings  made  by  attempting  to  pick  apart  the
    findings which in fact have to be read as a whole.

 9. In paragraph 31, Judge Brown identifies that the appellant's account is
    not wholly credible.  He continues by indicating that even if  it  were
    credible, it would be reasonable to expect the appellant to live safely
    in Pakistan because it was reasonable to expect her not to  pursue  the
    property claim since as she admitted she  had  no  entitlement  to  any
    property.

10. In paragraphs 32 to 35, Judge Brown explains why he finds the appellant
    not to be credible.  He identifies what can only be classed as  "gaping
    holes" in her account.  It is reasonable to  find  that  a  person  who
    cannot  give  a  coherent  account  is  not  generally  credible.    To
    understand why Judge Brown drew adverse inferences from  the  fact  the
    appellant's husband came to the UK before her and from  the  fact  that
    the appellant lived safely in Pakistan with her aunt and uncle, we have
    to read paragraph 35 it is necessary to see that he took  into  account
    the periods of time involved.  The appellant lived safely  in  Pakistan
    for six years, of which she spent two and a half years with  her  uncle
    and aunt.  The appellant's husband came to the UK in 2010  whereas  she
    arrived in January 2014.  It is  clear  that  it  was  the  substantial
    periods of time that led to the adverse inferences being drawn and this
    is perfectly reasonable.

11. As to the claimed beatings the appellant suffered from her brother  and
    ex-fianc�, it is evident from paragraph 36 that  Judge  Brown  did  not
    accept the account.  He relied on the fact that the  appellant  claimed
    she had miscarried but had not sought any medical attention  whilst  in
    Pakistan.  Although she had mentioned the incident to her GP in the UK,
    her admission that she had not sought medical attention  for  something
    which would have been traumatic undermined her reliability.   The  fact
    Judge Brown also relied on the failure of the appellant's husband  from
    making  a  claim  for  asylum  at  the  earliest  opportunity  is  also
    reasonable.  Of course, the fact  Judge  Brown  rejected  this  account
    meant he did not  have  to  make  a  specific  finding  regarding  past
    persecution.  Similarly, the  fact  Judge  Brown  identified  that  the
    events involving the appellant's husband in 2007 were immaterial to the
    current claim (see paragraph 34) meant that he need not  consider  that
    as an issue relevant to past persecution.

12. Turning to the findings in relation to  the  documents,  the  arguments
    relied on by Mr Sellwood fail to  engage  with  the  findings  actually
    made.  The arguments seek to say that  an  alternative  approach  would
    have been possible.  That, of course, does not identify an error  on  a
    point of law.  Judge Brown questions the reliability of  the  newspaper
    adverts  because  he  had  no  plausible  explanation  as  to  how  the
    appellant's brother and ex-fianc� would have been able to obtain  posed
    photographs of the appellant and her husband.  The adverts  were  small
    and the likelihood of being spotted by the friend  of  the  appellant's
    husband was  minimal.   Reasonable  suspicions  arose  because  of  the
    convenient timing of the adverts.  The finding was open to Judge  Brown
    on the evidence.  The same can be said for the death certificates.  The
    lack of details of the cause of death and the spelling errors undermine
    what confidence could be placed in the documents.

13. Because I find that it was  open  to  Judge  Brown  to  disbelieve  the
    appellant's account because he has given clear and cogent  reasons  for
    coming to that conclusion, the remainder of the appellant's  complaints
    fall away.  She is not a refugee or  a  person  otherwise  in  need  of
    international protection.

14. I mention, for completeness, that no  argument  in  relation  to  Judge
    Brown's assessment of the appellant's private and  family  life  rights
    have been raised and therefore there is no need  for  me  to  make  any
    findings in relation to those conclusions.



Decision

The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed because  there  is
no error on a point of law in the decision and reasons  statement  of  Judge
Brown.

His decision in relation  to  the  appeal  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
upheld.
