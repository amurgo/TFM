For the Appellant:     Mr J Plowright; Blakewells Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Philippines. She entered the UK on 18
    November 2009 and has resided in the UK to date. The  Appellant's  last
    period of leave expired on 5 June 2013 when she withdrew her  last  in-
    time application for an extension of  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur)  migrant.  Thereafter,  the  Appellant  made  successive
    applications for further  leave  to  remain,  which  were  unsuccessful
    culminating in her most recent refusal of her application for leave  to
    remain as the spouse of a settled person. That refusal was dated 8  May
    2014. Following that refusal, the Appellant's  solicitors  submitted  a
    letter requesting consideration of her human rights under Article 8  of
    the ECHR. That consideration was refused via a  letter  dated  17  July
    2014 that was accompanied by an IS151B, Notice of Immigration  Decision
    that was dated 22  July  2014.  The  Appellant  appealed  against  that
    decision.

 2. The Appellant's appeal was decided on  the  papers  submitted  and  was
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Narayan  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 3. The Appellant appealed against the decision of Judge  Narayan  and  was
    granted permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  White.  The
    grounds upon which permission was granted may be summarised as follows:

      i) It is arguable that there has been  procedural  unfairness  in  the
         Appellant not being informed of  the  deadline  for  submission  of
         evidence when the appeal changed from an oral hearing to one to  be
         decided on the papers, which may have deprived the Appellant  of  a
         reasonable opportunity to submit material evidence;

     ii) It is arguable that the judge erred in stating "there is  no  legal
         imperative to consider free standing Article 8".

 4. I was provided with a 'Rule 24'  response  from  the  Respondent  which
    states that the judge had found there were no exceptional circumstances
    such that removal is not appropriate and the judge considered if  there
    were compelling reasons to why the Appellant should not be removed.

    Submissions

 5. Mr Plowright placed reliance on his skeleton  argument,  which  I  have
    fully considered in reaching my decision.  In  relation  to  the  first
    ground concerning procedural fairness, Mr  Plowright  rightly  accepted
    that this was the only ground with a prospect of success. Mr  Plowright
    highlighted that there were no  witness  statements  as  there  was  no
    forewarning of when the evidence should be submitted. I was provided by
    the Appellant's solicitors with  a  29-page  bundle  including  various
    exhibits, which arrived the day before the hearing.  It  was  contended
    that this bundle should be  considered  as  it  would  demonstrate  the
    materiality in not being given the opportunity to present evidence,  as
    the bundle contained evidence that the Appellant  would  have  produced
    had she been given the opportunity.

 6. After taking instructions from his solicitors, Mr Plowright was able to
    produce a letter from those that instruct him, sent to IAC Stoke on  28
    October 2014 which recorded the Appellant's request to change  from  an
    oral to a paper-based appeal hearing. The appeal was originally  listed
    to be heard at Nottingham Magistrates Court on  10  November  2014.  Mr
    Plowright also produced a further letter of the same  date  and  format
    sent to Nottingham Magistrates Court by his instructing solicitors. The
    Tribunal's file carries a reply to the letters dated 10  November  2014
    which reflects that the request was accepted but makes  no  mention  of
    any further matters other than there being no  fee  to  refund  to  the
    Appellant. Mr Plowright finally produced a 'file note' from  Blakewells
    solicitors' files dated 7 November 2014 which  reflects  that  a  staff
    member from the firm called the Tribunal to  ask  if  the  hearing  was
    changed from an oral hearing to a  paper  one  and  that  the  Tribunal
    apparently stated that the hearing was de-listed and a notice would  be
    sent soon with a date for final submissions. The note finally  reflects
    that the call lasted five minutes. Mr Plowright submitted that the file
    note should be taken at face value but accepted that Blakewells  should
    have submitted the file note sooner and included a statement  of  truth
    regarding the events underlying the grounds of appeal which  failed  to
    give any relevant dates or specifics underlying permission to appeal.

 7. Concerning the substantive Determination, Mr Plowright  submitted  that
    the judge is  technically  wrong  to  state  that  there  is  no  legal
    imperative to consider freestanding Article 8 at paragraph 19. However,
    he accepted that the judge dealt with Article 8 at paragraph 17 anyhow.
    Mr Plowright describes ground 3 as  not  being  of  assistance  anyhow.
    Concerning the materiality  of  the  absent  evidence  to  the  judge's
    determination, it was submitted that the only additional  evidence  was
    that the Appellant was pregnant with a child at the time and that child
    is now born. Mr Plowright submitted it was a Chikwamba-style  case  and
    that there would need to be exceptional circumstances,  however  making
    an application for entry  clearance  might  be  a  moot  point  as  the
    Appellant's husband is receiving disability living  allowance  and  may
    not be able to meet the ï¿½18,600 threshold. If  I  found  there  was  an
    error, I was invited to proceed to re-make the decision  based  on  the
    evidence now on file.

 8. In reply, Mr Kotas accepted that the solicitors had called the Tribunal
    concerning the change of hearing from an oral one to a paper-based one.
    Mr Kotas submitted that there should have  been  a  supporting  witness
    statement dealing with the unfairness in the manner in which the appeal
    proceeded and  was  reluctant  to  accept  there  had  been  procedural
    unfairness when that had not been made out on the evidence.

 9. Concerning the substantive Determination and  the  materiality  of  the
    absent evidence, Mr Kotas noted that there is a Department for Work and
    Pensions (DWP) Letter and other evidence which post-dates  the  hearing
    which I was asked not to take into account as it would  not  have  been
    provided. Mr  Kotas  accepted  that  the  strongest  factors  were  the
    Appellant's pregnancy and that she would have been 1 month pregnant  at
    the time (as her due date was recorded as 22/08/15 at the time at  page
    36 of the bundle). The other evidence not before the  Tribunal  related
    to the husband's family connections  in  the  UK.  However,  given  the
    Appellant's immigration history, she submitted a Tier 1 entrepreneur on
    1  August  2012  which  was  withdrawn  on  5  June  2013,  and  before
    withdrawing that application she made a variation of her application on
    5 Feb 2013 based upon her private and family life with  a  George  Doko
    (as stated in the refusal letter) which was refused with  no  right  of
    appeal. The Appellant states in her witness statement that she met  her
    current partner (Mr Heng Keong Lim) in March 2013 and the  relationship
    started in April 2013. Their marriage took place in November  2013  and
    the Appellant got married when she had no leave and  as  there  are  no
    children  involved  at  the  date  of  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, based on SS (Congo), exceptional circumstances are needed and
    even if the Appellant were one month pregnant,  the  judge  would  have
    reached the same conclusion.  It  was  further  submitted  that  little
    weight should be given to the  Appellant's  private  life  due  to  her
    precarious status. In terms of Article 8, it was contended  that  there
    was a full balancing exercise. Mr Kotas  asked  me  to  note  that  the
    Appellant has not turned up again and it was unsatisfactory to  proceed
    without her and there was no  medical  evidence  excusing  her.  Taking
    evidence at its highest, the two pieces of missing evidence,  the  one-
    month pregnancy and the husband's family connections,  would  not  have
    been of assistance.

    Error of Law

10. At the close of submissions,  I  indicated  that  I  would  reserve  my
    decision, which I now give. In summary, I find that there was no  error
    of law in the decision such that it should be set aside. My reasons for
    so finding are as follows.

11. I find that do not find that there is an error of  law  such  that  the
    determination should be set aside. As stated at  the  hearing  to  both
    parties, I cannot take  new  facts  into  account  which  were  not  in
    existence at the time of the hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    such as the recent birth of the Appellant's and her partner's child.

12. I do not find that there has been  procedural  unfairness  that  either
    intentionally or inadvertently resulted in the Appellant being deprived
    of the opportunity of putting material evidence before the  judge  that
    then led to a material error in the judge's determination.  I  come  to
    this  conclusion  having  given  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  to   the
    Appellant's solicitors' late-served evidence  that  a  phone  call  was
    placed to the Tribunal whereupon the solicitors  were  apparently  told
    that there would be a notice sent  to  them  with  'a  date  for  final
    submissions'. I reluctantly give the benefit of such doubt as it is not
    in the custom of Tribunal staff to give such assurances regarding dates
    for service of submissions as  the  evidence  is  customarily  provided
    several weeks in advance of a hearing and the request  to  de-list  the
    hearing only took place less than  2  weeks  before  the  hearing  date
    itself.  Therefore,   one   would   have   expected   the   Appellant's
    representatives to have complied with any directions before that  time.
    As it so happens, the appeal was 'heard' on the papers on  11  December
    2014, more than one month after the  Appellant's  representatives  were
    informed that the hearing would take place on paper. During that  time,
    no further correspondence was exchanged and there is no  evidence  from
    the Appellant's solicitors showing that further enquiries were made  as
    to when any remaining evidence should be submitted by.

13. Returning to the ground of appeal, in order to gauge whether there  was
    procedural unfairness it is crucial to determine  what  difference  any
    absent evidence would have made to the judge's  decision  to  determine
    the unfairness that is said to be present in this particular  scenario.
    Context is key.

14. Turning to the judge's determination,  whilst  noting  the  absence  of
    statements from the Appellant and her husband (at  paragraph  11),  the
    judge considers the documentation submitted by the Appellant  with  her
    application and concludes that the Appellant does meet the  suitability
    requirements and eligibility requirements for limited leave  to  remain
    as a partner and that the partner does meet the definition of a partner
    under the Immigration  Rules.  Notwithstanding  Mr  Kotas'  submissions
    regarding a previous relationship  with  George  Doko,  the  judge  has
    already accepted that the Appellant is  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with her husband, Mr  Lim.  The  reason  that  the  appeal
    failed is due to the Appellant failing to show insurmountable obstacles
    to family life with her  husband  continuing  outside  the  UK  in  the
    Philippines or Malaysia and that 276ADE(iii) to (vi)  are  equally  not
    met. This is fully reflected at paragraphs 15-16 of  the  determination
    and a separate Article 8 assessment is performed at length at paragraph
    17 thereafter. The question is does the new evidence establish anything
    which the judge would have considered  an  insurmountable  obstacle  or
    sufficiently compelling to render removal disproportionate.

15. I have fully considered the bundle of evidence submitted (although only
    served the day before the hearing) from the Appellant's representatives
    which includes Exhibit JRP001, which is a bundle of documents that  the
    Appellant submits would have been placed before the First-tier Tribunal
    had she had the opportunity. The key  evidence  from  these  40  pages,
    which both parties found their submissions upon,  is  the  evidence  of
    pregnancy and the partner's family ties.

16. When assessing this evidence it is important to bear in mind  that  the
    judge  has  performed  a  comprehensive  Article  8  assessment  as  Mr
    Plowright rightly observed in his submissions at paragraph 17  of  that
    determination.

17. Taking the evidence in turn, turning first to the witness statements of
    the Appellant and her husband, in my  judgment,  there  is  nothing  of
    materiality that is referred to that would affect the  outcome  of  the
    judge's assessment from paragraphs 10 onwards of the determination. The
    letters from the Appellant's brother-in-law and his wife do not add any
    detail to the consideration already given by  the  judge.  The  letters
    discuss in very brief terms that the couple are  happy  and  rely  upon
    each other but do not state much more. There is a  letter  from  Castle
    Partnership  GP  Practice  however,  this   evidence   post-dates   the
    determination and would not have been before the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Nonetheless, the partner's ill health was  already  considered  in  the
    Respondent's refusal letter and that  refusal  and  its  reasoning  was
    explicitly upheld  in  the  judge's  determination.  However,  any  new
    evidence  concerning  treatment  for  or  rehabilitation  due  to   the
    partner's polio is a matter of new evidence that could  not  have  been
    presented to the Tribunal  and  cannot  be  considered  by  me  now  in
    considering the lawfulness of the determination. Again,  there  is  new
    evidence from the DWP which  documents  the  partner's  entitlement  to
    benefits however, this evidence did not come into existence until  well
    after the hearing and could not have been put before  the  Tribunal  at
    the relevant time. Next, there is an NHS  printout  which  records  the
    Appellant's pregnancy and her due  date  being  22  August  2015.  This
    confirms that at the relevant date  of  paper  hearing,  the  Appellant
    would have been a few weeks to one month pregnant.  It  is  clear  that
    taking this evidence at its highest; the pregnancy would have been in a
    nascent stage and a far off event that could not have had a bearing  on
    the Appellant's removal at that time. Again, the  subsequent  birth  or
    nationality of any child the Appellant may have had is not a matter for
    this Tribunal retrospectively assessing what evidence could  have  been
    placed before the Tribunal on 11 December 2014.

18. Therefore, having considered the new  evidence  that  might  have  been
    before the Tribunal on 11 December 2014, namely the letters of  support
    from  the  Appellant's  brother-in-law  and  his  wife,   the   witness
    statements and the evidence of pregnancy, taking all of  that  evidence
    at  its  highest,  none  of  it  establishes  anything  that  could  be
    classified as an insurmountable obstacle or sufficiently compelling  to
    render the decision to remove as disproportionate.

19. Concerning the new evidence referred to above, none of  it  could  have
    been raised before the First-tier Tribunal and it cannot be  said  that
    the First-tier judge erred in  law  in  failing  to  consider  it.  The
    Appellant is entitled to ask for that evidence to be considered by  the
    Respondent on a further application if so advised,  but  it  is  of  no
    concern for this Tribunal in this context.

20. In summary, I am not satisfied that there is any error of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, or any that  could  have  affected
    the outcome of the appeal.

    Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.

22. The decision to dismiss the appeal therefore stands.
