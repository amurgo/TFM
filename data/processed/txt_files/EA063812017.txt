Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Bellara, instructed by Western Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Following a grant of permission to appeal against the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision of 4 July 2017  refusing  to  issue  her  with  a
    permanent residence card under the Immigration (European Economic Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations"), it was found, at an error  of
    law hearing on 5 October 2018, that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  made
    errors of law in its decision. The decision was accordingly set aside.

 2. The appellant, born on 6 August 1963,  is  a  citizen  of  Brazil.  She
    entered the UK on  14  October  2005  with  her  daughter,  an  Italian
    national, and was granted a residence card as a dependent parent of her
    daughter on 11 August 2011. The  residence  card  was  valid  until  11
    August 2016.

 3. On 3 June 2016 the appellant applied for a permanent residence card  on
    the basis of her continuous dependence upon her EEA national  daughter.
    Her application was refused on 6 December 2016 as it was  not  accepted
    that she was dependent upon her daughter since the  documents  she  had
    submitted showed that she was working and that she was  in  receipt  of
    housing  benefit  and  therefore  responsible  for  the  rent  of   her
    accommodation, and that her bank statements showed no evidence of money
    transfers from her sponsor. The respondent considered  the  appellant's
    application failed to meet the requirements of  regulation  7(1)(c)  of
    the EEA Regulations 2006  as  the  dependent  direct  relative  of  her
    daughter in the ascending line.

 4. The appellant submitted a further application for a permanent residence
    card on 6 January 2017, in which it was explained that  her  employment
    was only part-time and was to enable her to save  for  her  retirement,
    but  that  she  was  entirely  dependent  upon  her  daughter  and  her
    daughter's husband. Her daughter had given her cash and  therefore  her
    bank account did not show transfers. The housing benefit had only  been
    in her name as her daughter was a minor at the time and  in  any  event
    she had paid back overpayment of housing benefit to  the  council.  She
    had always lived with her daughter in the UK and  was  financially  and
    emotionally dependent upon her.

 5. The appellant's application was refused on 4 July 2017 under  the  2016
    EEA Regulations. The respondent noted that the appellant  had  been  in
    receipt of housing benefit and therefore dependent upon the State.  The
    respondent was unable to ascertain from the documentation the appellant
    had produced whether the rent and utility costs  of  her  accommodation
    were maintained by herself or her daughter and could not  be  satisfied
    from those documents or her sponsor's  bank  statements  that  she  was
    dependent upon her daughter and had been so for a continuous period  of
    five years.

 6. The appellant appealed against that decision. Her appeal was  heard  by
    Judge Povey in the First-tier Tribunal on 20 February 2018.  The  judge
    was satisfied that the appellant had always resided with the sponsor in
    the UK.  However  the  judge  was  concerned  that  the  issue  of  the
    appellant's  part-time  employment  had  only  been  raised  in  cross-
    examination by the presenting officer, and had not been referred to  in
    any of the documentary evidence or in examination in  chief.  He  heard
    oral evidence from the appellant and her daughter about her income from
    employment which the appellant said that she had been saving for future
    grandchildren. The judge  accepted  the  sponsor's  evidence  that  her
    mother earned �700 a month for 16 hours work a week. He considered that
    that was higher than the national living wage and the primary  earnings
    threshold and that her income was  therefore  sufficient  to  meet  her
    basic needs. As such  he  considered  that  she  earned  sufficient  to
    support herself and that she  was  therefore  not  dependent  upon  her
    daughter and had not been so  for  five  continuous  years.  The  judge
    referred to the appellant's lack of candour in regard to her employment
    and income and concluded that she did not  meet  the  requirements  for
    permanent residence. He dismissed the appeal.

 7. The appellant sought, and was granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal. At an error of law hearing on 5 October 2018,  I  found
    errors of law in the judge's decision and set it aside, as follows:

    "9.  At the error of law hearing, Mr Bellara submitted that  the  judge
    had erred by  saying  he  was  taken  by  surprise  in  regard  to  the
    appellant's employment and that the parties had not been  candid,  when
    there had been evidence of the employment before  him.  The  judge  had
    failed to consider the appellant's  explanation  for  working  and  had
    undertaken a forensic assessment of the  appellant's  earnings  without
    giving her an opportunity to address the matter.


    10.  Mr Walker considered that the author of the Rule 24  had  not  had
    all the information before her and he conceded that the judge had  been
    unfair in his comments about the appellant's candidness when there  was
    evidence of her employment before him. He agreed  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law.


    11.  In the circumstances I set aside the judge's decision. Whilst  the
    grounds referred to a lack of credibility findings,  it  seemed  to  me
    that the main issue was the assessment of dependency on  the  basis  of
    the legal definition and the relevant  financial  thresholds,  with  no
    issue being taken as to the credibility of  the  parties.  The  judge's
    adverse findings arising from the appellant's failure to disclose  that
    she was employed was clearly wrong, as the evidence of  her  employment
    was before him. Mr Walker  accepted  that  there  were  no  credibility
    issues.


    12.  It was agreed by all parties that the most appropriate course  was
    for the decision to be re-made in the Upper Tribunal on the sole  issue
    of dependency, at a resumed hearing for which skeleton arguments  could
    be produced and submissions made on the relevant matters."

 8. The appeal then came before me again on 18 December  2018.  Although  I
    had made directions, in my error of law decision, for  the  parties  to
    file  a  skeleton  argument  addressing   the   legal   and   financial
    implications  of  the  appellant's  employment  on  the   question   of
    dependency for the purposes of regulation 7  of  the  EEA  Regulations,
    neither party had produced a skeleton argument. I would comment that it
    is highly unsatisfactory that the directions had been ignored.

 9. In any event, the appeal proceeded and both parties made submissions.

10. Mr Bellara advised me that the appellant was no longer working and that
    her P45 would be  produced  to  confirm  that  (the  P45  was  produced
    subsequent to the hearing), although he accepted that the Tribunal  had
    to consider the question of dependency over  a  five  year  period.  Mr
    Bellara relied upon the case of Lim v Entry  Clearance  Officer  Manila
    [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 which set out the test for dependency, namely that
    there had to be a real dependency. He submitted that there was  a  real
    dependency in this case as the appellant had lived under the same  roof
    as her daughter for a number of years.  She  had  undertaken  part-time
    work only to keep herself occupied. She had worked in a Brazilian  shop
    in Willesden. Her monthly income had fluctuated between �500  and  �700
    depending on the  hours  of  work.  There  should  not  be  a  forensic
    examination of the appellant's income  but  it  was  more  relevant  to
    consider that she still required material support  from  her  daughter.
    All the bills were paid by the sponsor and her husband. The appellant's
    part-time work had not put her in a position where she was  financially
    independent and the fact that she had chosen to work should not be held
    against her. There was no evidence  to  suggest  that  the  income  was
    adequate to accommodate herself and manage with daily living  expenses.
    Mr Bellara relied on the case of Reyes v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT  314  in  submitting
    that it was necessary to take  a  holistic  approach,  considering  the
    appellant's length of residence with her  daughter  and  the  fact  she
    still needed material support from her daughter.

11. Mr Avery relied on [32] of Lim which he submitted summed up this  case.
    The appellant was able to support herself and did not need the  support
    of her daughter for her essential needs.

12. Mr Bellara reiterated the points previously made in response.

Consideration and discussion

13. Both parties relied on relevant caselaw in assessing  the  question  of
    dependence. In the case of Reyes [2013] UKUT  314  the  Upper  Tribunal
    made the following comments at [19] of its decision:

    "From the  above,  we  glean  four  key  things.  First,  the  test  of
    dependency is a purely factual test. Second, the Court  envisages  that
    questions of dependency must not be reduced to a  bare  calculation  of
    financial dependency but should  be  construed  broadly  to  involve  a
    holistic examination of  a  number  of  factors,  including  financial,
    physical and social conditions, so as to  establish  whether  there  is
    dependence that is genuine.  The essential  focus  has  to  be  on  the
    nature  of  the  relationship  concerned  and  on  whether  it  is  one
    characterised by a situation of dependence based on an  examination  of
    all the factual circumstances, bearing in mind the underlying objective
    of maintaining the unity of the family. It seems to us  that  the  need
    for a wide-ranging fact-specific approach is  indeed  enjoined  by  the
    Court of  Appeal  in  SM  (India):  see  in  particular  Sullivan  LJ's
    observations at [27]-[28]. Third, it is clear from the wording of  both
    Article 2.2 and regulation 7(1) that the test is one  of  present,  not
    past dependency. Both provisions  employ  the  present  tense  (Article
    2.2(b) and (c) refer to family members who "are dependants" or who  are
    "dependent";   regulation   7(c)   refers    to    "dependent    direct
    relatives...").  Fourth  (and  this  may  have  relevance  to  what  is
    understood by present dependency), interpretation of the meaning of the
    term  must  be  such  as  not  to  deprive  that   provision   of   its
    effectiveness. "

    and at [22]:

    "As the case law makes clear, in  the  context  of  EU  law  on  family
    members the test of dependency is not whether a  person  is  wholly  or
    mainly dependent, but whether he  or  she  is  reliant  on  others  for
    essential living needs."

14.  In Reyes (Judgment of the Court) [2014] EUECJ C-423/12, the CJEU found
    as follows:

    "22      In order to determine the existence of such  dependence,  the
    host Member State must assess whether, having regard to  his  financial
    and social conditions, the direct descendant, who is 21  years  old  or
    older, of a Union citizen, is not in a position to support himself. The
    need for material support must exist in the State  of  origin  of  that
    descendant or the State whence he came at the time when he  applies  to
    join that citizen (see, to that effect, Jia, paragraph 37).


    23      However, there is no need to determine the  reasons  for  that
    dependence  or  therefore  for  the  recourse  to  that  support.  That
    interpretation is dictated in particular by the principle according  to
    which the provisions, such as Directive 2004/38, establishing the free
    movement of Union citizens, which constitute one of the foundations  of
    the European Union, must be construed broadly  (see,  to  that  effect,
    Jia, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).


    24      The fact that, in circumstances such as those in  question  in
    the main proceedings, a Union  citizen  regularly,  for  a  significant
    period, pays a sum of money to that descendant, necessary in order  for
    him to support himself in the State of origin, is such as to show  that
    the descendant is in a real  situation  of  dependence  vis-�-vis  that
    citizen.


    25      In those circumstances, that descendant cannot be required, in
    addition, to establish that he has tried without success to  find  work
    or obtain subsistence support from the authorities of  his  country  of
    origin and/or otherwise tried to support himself."

15. In Lim, the Court of Appeal provided at [25]:

    "In my judgment, this makes it  unambiguously  clear  that  it  is  not
    enough simply to show that financial support is in fact provided by the
    EU citizen to the family member. There are numerous references in these
    paragraphs which are only consistent with  a  notion  that  the  family
    member must need this support from his or her  relatives  in  order  to
    meet his or her basic needs."

    and at [32]:

    "In my judgment, the critical question is whether the  claimant  is  in
    fact in a position to support himself or not, and Reyes now makes  that
    clear beyond doubt, in my view. That is a simple matter of fact. If  he
    can support himself, there is  no  dependency,  even  if  he  is  given
    financial  material  support  by  the  EU  citizen.  Those   additional
    resources are not necessary to enable him to meet his basic needs.  If,
    on the other hand, he cannot support himself from  his  own  resources,
    the court will not ask why that is the case, save perhaps  where  there
    is an abuse of rights. The fact that he chooses not to get  a  job  and
    become self-supporting is irrelevant. It follows that on the  facts  of
    this case, there was no dependency. The  appellant  had  the  funds  to
    support herself. She was financially independent and did not  need  the
    additional resources for the purpose of meeting her basic needs."

16. What can be derived from the above is that the test of dependency is  a
    purely factual test, that it must not be reduced to a bare  calculation
    of financial dependency but should involve a holistic examination,  and
    that a critical question is whether the applicant can  support  herself
    and meet her essential needs without the additional support of the  EEA
    national.

17. Applying those principles to the appellant's case it seems to  me  that
    she is able to establish the required dependency. Mr Avery's submission
    was that [32] of Lim provided the answer to the  appellant's  case  and
    that she was very capable of supporting herself.  However  a  potential
    ability to support oneself was not the determinative  factor  according
    to the cases to which I have referred and, indeed, the Court of  Appeal
    in Lim endorsed contrary observations  made  in  previous  caselaw,  as
    referred to at [20], with reference to  [27]  of  SM  (India)  v  Entry
    Clearance Officer (Mumbai) [2009] EWCA Civ 1426, that dependency  could
    arise in a case where an  applicant  who  could  work  and  earn  money
    decided not to. Although the issue  concerned  a  person  who  was  not
    working, albeit capable of working, rather than a person  such  as  the
    appellant who was actually working, it seems  to  me  that  a  holistic
    approach is nevertheless required.

18. The facts are that the appellant has always lived with her daughter, an
    EEA national, since they came to the UK when her daughter was a  minor.
    The documentary evidence confirms the accounts given by the  appellant,
    her daughter and her son-in-law that all bills and expenses,  including
    rent, gas, electricity and water,  are  paid  for  by  the  appellant's
    daughter and her husband. The appellant has provided a response to  the
    respondent's concerns in regard to a prior receipt of  housing  benefit
    in her name, namely that at  the  time  the  benefit  was  claimed  her
    daughter was unable to be the named recipient as she was  a  minor  and
    the benefit subsequently ceased when her daughter commenced employment,
    with overpayments made in error being repaid. The  appellant  has  also
    explained the discrepancy as to the date when she moved to the property
    at Appleby Close in 2013 and it is not in dispute that she  has  always
    lived with her daughter and subsequently her daughter  and  son-in-law.
    Although there is no earlier evidence of a transfer of funds  from  the
    sponsor to the appellant, I accept the oral evidence that cash payments
    were made and that the appellant's expenses have always been met by her
    daughter and son-in-law.

19. As for the question of the appellant's employment, it  is  particularly
    relevant to note that she has produced  evidence  of  employment  since
    2009 and was therefore in employment at the time the respondent  issued
    her with a residence card as the family member of an  EEA  national  in
    August 2011. Although I have not seen evidence of that residence  card,
    it is not in dispute that it was issued to the appellant on  11  August
    2011. Accordingly the respondent  was  previously  satisfied  that  the
    appellant was dependent upon her EEA national sponsor despite being  in
    employment. Judge Povey, in the First-tier Tribunal, proceeded  on  the
    basis that the appellant's employment  commenced  after  the  residence
    card was issued, at [18] of his decision, and took  that  as  a  factor
    against her, whereas  that  appears  to  have  been  a  mistaken  view.
    Accordingly, whilst it is the case  that  the  appellant  has  been  in
    receipt of an income from part-time employment, I accept that that  was
    not sufficient to meet her basic needs in terms of accommodation,  food
    and utilities and that she was therefore not in a position  to  support
    herself.

20. In the circumstances, taking a holistic view  in  the  context  of  the
    relevant authorities, and considering  the  level  of  the  appellant's
    income from  employment,  I  am  satisfied  on  balance  that  she  has
    demonstrated the required  dependency  for  the  purposes  of  the  EEA
    Regulations so as  to  be  considered  as  the  family  member  of  her
    daughter, an EEA national exercising treaty rights  in  the  UK.  I  am
    satisfied that that has been demonstrated for a  continuous  period  of
    five years and that the appellant has therefore  acquired  a  right  of
    permanent residence in the UK as a result. I therefore allow the appeal
    under the EEA Regulations.


DECISION


21. The original Tribunal was found to have made an error of law. I re-make
    the decision by allowing the appeal under the EEA Regulations.
