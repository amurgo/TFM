For the Appellant:     Mr M Islam (Counsel)

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge H Graves, promulgated on 3rd October 2015, following a hearing at
    Hatton Cross on 22nd September 2015.  In the determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Ishak Ali, whereupon the Respondent Secretary  of
    State subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission  to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, who was born  on  5th
    November 1947.  He appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State refusing his application for entry clearance as  the
    spouse of a person present and settled in the UK.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he is the spouse of Mrs Rushna Begum, and
    the two of them have three adult children, all living  abroad,  and  he
    has been married since 4th October 1974.  They all lived in  Bangladesh
    until the Sponsor moved to the United Kingdom to care for  her  elderly
    parents.  The Appellant made his application  for  entry  clearance  on
    11th June 2014 but this was refused on 13th August 2014  on  the  basis
    that the Appellant had failed to provide wage slips valid in the 28-day
    period before the application was submitted, or bank statements showing
    payments that correspond to the nett amount of the pay  slips,  because
    the Sponsor was paid in cash.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge  observed  how  the  Respondent's  basis  for  rejecting  the
    application was that it was not clear from the  bank  statements  which
    payments corresponded to the employment income, and that in any  event,
    the Sponsor's annual equivalent income was less than �18,600, which was
    the required income for the purposes of her  spouse  application.   The
    judge rejected this analysis for the reasons that he gave.

 5. The judge pointed out that the issue was a "narrow one" (paragraph 14).



 6. In issue, as the judge explained, was paragraph 1 of Appendix FM -  SE,
    which states that

         "In relation to evidencing the financial requirements  in  Appendix
         FM the following general provisions shall apply ... (n)  the  gross
         amount of any  cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the  person's
         specified bank statements show the nett amount which relates to the
         gross amount shown on the pay slips (or in the  relevant  specified
         evidence provided in addition to the specified bank  statements  in
         relation to non-employment income).  Otherwise only the nett amount
         shown on the specified bank statements may be counted".

 7. The judge went on to consider what it was meant to say that  the  gross
    amount of any cash income may be counted where the  person's  specified
    bank statements show the nett amount  "which  relates"  to  the  "gross
    amount shown on their pay slips".  He explained that the language  here
    did not refer  to  that  which  "exactly  matches"  or  that  which  is
    "identical to" or that which is "the same as" or  even  that  which  is
    "equivalent to" (see paragraph  19).   The  language  here  was  simply
    "which relates".

 8. In the circumstances, the judge heard submissions from Counsel for  the
    Appellant that on page 3 of the Appellant's bundle of documents  was  a
    complete account of what was received in the bank account and that "the
    total credited amount comes to �185 more than  the  total  nett  income
    from pay slips", but this was because

         "The Sponsor said that she was paid in cash,  but  that  she  would
         typically use a small amount of that cash for  her  bus  fare  into
         town, for toiletries and incidentals, and then pay the lion's share
         into her bank account.  She said that she did not go to the bank on
         the same day as being paid, sometimes she would pay two pay packets
         into the bank on the same day ..." (paragraph 20).

    As the Sponsor explained, "it was simply more convenient to be paid  in
    cash and then use some of the cash for her living expenses.  She was  a
    carer for her mother so could not always get to the  town  straightaway
    ..." (paragraph 20).

 9. The judge went on to refer to the schedule provided by Counsel for  the
    Appellant at page 3 of the bundle and observed that

         "This schedule demonstrates a pattern, whereby around two or  three
         days after each and every pay packet, over a six month period,  the
         Sponsor pays in a substantial amount of cash to her account.   Each
         pay packet was in the amount of �299 to �305.   Each  payment  into
         the bank was always over �200, except for two  occasions  when  the
         Sponsor said the money was needed for  bills  ..."  (see  paragraph
         21).

10. What was significant was that the judge found evidence from the Sponsor
    that she said

         "She often paid more into her account because she would  keep  some
         money at home and then supplement her regular payments.  I note too
         that she lives with her  mother  and  brother,  her  father  having
         passed away, and in a shared household it is reasonable that  there
         be some money moving between family members which may  account  for
         the slight variations" (paragraph 21).

11. The judge concluded that he would find that "the Sponsor's  credits  to
    her bank statements do relate, both in time period and  in  amount,  to
    the amount of her nett pay, as shown on the  other  specified  evidence
    ..." (paragraph 22).

12. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

13. The grounds of application state that the judge  had  made  a  material
    misdirection of law because Appendix FM  -  SE  makes  it  clear  that,
    whereas the gross amount of any cash income may be  counted  where  the
    person's specified bank statements show the nett amount  which  relates
    to  the  gross  amount  shown  on  their  pay   slips,"   nevertheless,
    "otherwise, only the nett amount shown on the specified bank statements
    may be counted".  This was a case where the Sponsor did not pay all her
    cash wages into her bank  account  as  she  retained  some  for  sundry
    purposes.  The judge therefore failed to consider the final sentence of
    the requirement above.  Where the total amount is  not  paid  into  the
    bank account that the gross amount of the Sponsor's wages  cannot  then
    be taken into consideration.

14. Permission to appeal was granted on 19th February 2016  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

Submissions

15. At the hearing before me on 1st April  2016,  Mr  Islam,  appearing  on
    behalf  of  the  Appellant  once  again,  handed  up  the   Immigration
    Directorate Instruction on Family Migration, which  specifically  dealt
    with  Appendix  FM  Section  1.7  (August  2015).   He  highlighted  in
    particular section 5 of this IDI.

16. Mr Walker, appearing on behalf of the Respondent  Secretary  of  State,
    repeated the grounds of application and submitted that  the  judge  had
    misconstrued the Rules and this appeal should be allowed.

17. Mr Islam, submitted that the IDI Appendix FM 1.7 that he had handed up,
    had to be read in conjunction with the  breakdown  of  the  Appellant's
    income which appears in the Appellant's bundle at page  3.   What  this
    IDI states at paragraph 5.1.1 is that where the applicant's partner  is
    in salaried employment at the date of the application and has been with
    the same employer for at least six months prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application,

         "They can count their gross annual  salary  towards  the  financial
         requirement.  In doing so they must have been paid  throughout  the
         period of six months prior to the date of application at a level of
         gross annual salary which equals or exceeds the level  relied  upon
         in the application".

18. On this basis  Mr  Islam  had  two  submissions  to  make.   First,  he
    submitted that even  if  the  judge  had  completely  misconstrued  the
    relevant Immigration Rule the Appellant would still succeed, because as
    the judge found the schedule that had been produced on page  3  of  the
    Appellant's bundle followed a particular pattern, and was  accepted  by
    the Tribunal at face value, but it showed that there were two occasions
    when payments were not made.  If these payments, which  were  not  made
    were included into the schedule the Appellant's annual income would  be
    �19,670.  This is because during the six-month period  she  had  banked
    �8,355.  She still had an excess of �185 over and above that which  she
    was required to demonstrate, namely, the sum  of  �18,600.   She  would
    therefore be able to show an income of �18,600.   If  however  the  two
    payments which were not made into the bank account, "when  the  Sponsor
    said the  money  was  needed  for  bills"  (see  paragraph  21  of  the
    determination), then the Appellant still could  show  funds  that  were
    over and above �18,600.  So either  way,  the  financial  threshold  of
    �18,600 was met, and the judge had been correct to allow the appeal.

19. Second, however, if consideration was to be given to the Rules, and the
    manner in which the judge dealt with the Rules, the appeal still  would
    have been allowed because the IDI makes it  clear  at  paragraph  5.1.1
    that a salaried employee's gross annual  salary  must  have  been  paid
    throughout the period of six months to the date of application,  "at  a
    level of gross annual salary which equals or exceeds the  level  relied
    upon in the application".  The Appellant's  sponsoring  wife,  did  not
    just equal, but actually exceeded,  the  level  relied  upon,  for  the
    reasons that the judge very carefully explained at paragraph 21 of  the
    determination.  As the judge said,

         "She lives with her mother and brother, her  father  having  passed
         away, and in a shared household it is reasonable that there may  be
         some money moving between family members, which may account for the
         slight variations".

    This variation in the instant case was actually one which exceeded  the
    level relied upon.

No Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   In  what  is  a
    meticulously well crafted determination, given with all  due  care  and
    attention by the judge, adequate reasons have been given  for  why  the
    appeal was allowed, and the schedule  on  page  3  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle makes it quite clear that whichever way one looks at  this,  the
    Appellant's sponsoring wife was earning in excess of �18,600, and there
    was proof of this in the form of  bank  statements  that  received  her
    salary into the account, together with cash payments by her.  This  was
    the finding of the judge and it is a finding that was entirely open  to
    the judge on the evidence before him.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
