Representation:
For the Appellants:    In person
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are Pakistani citizens who were born on 21 January  1983
    and 8  September  1984  respectively.   They  appeal,  with  permission
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Brien, against  decisions  which
    were issued  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  White,  dismissing  their
    appeals against the respondent's refusal of their human rights claims.

Background

 2. The first appellant entered the United Kingdom in 2007,  holding  entry
    clearance as a student.  He was subsequently granted  leave  to  remain
    under Tier 1 of the Points Based System on three occasions.  The second
    appellant  joined  him  in  2012  and  held  leave  as  his   dependant
    throughout.  Their daughter  was  born  in  the  UK  in  2013.   Having
    completed ten  years'  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  first
    appellant applied for ILR under paragraph 276B.  The  second  appellant
    could not apply as his dependant  in  that  application.   She  made  a
    separate application on Article 8 ECHR  grounds,  with  their  daughter
    named as a  dependant  on  that  application.   The  first  appellant's
    initial ILR application was refused without a  right  of  appeal.   His
    second application  was  refused  on  14  February  2019.   The  second
    appellant's application was refused on 8 March 2019.


 3. The grounds of refusal in the first appellant's  appeal  gave  rise  to
    what has become known as an earnings discrepancy case  (see  Balajigari
    [2019] EWCA Civ 673; [2019] 1 WLR 4647, at [4]).  That is to  say  that
    the respondent was aware that  there  was  a  discrepancy  between  the
    earnings relied upon in a previous application for leave to remain  and
    the sums provided to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") for the
    same period.  In  particular,  the  respondent  noted  that  the  first
    appellant  had  declared  significantly  more  income   in   his   2011
    application for leave to remain than he had declared in his tax  return
    for that year.  The first appellant stated, in  a  questionnaire  which
    asked him to account for the discrepancy, that the lower  sum  provided
    to HMRC was attributable to an error on the part of his accountant  and
    that he had taken steps to correct this error by  making  contact  with
    HMRC in 2015.   The  respondent  concluded,  however,  that  the  first
    appellant had been dishonest in his dealings with either  HMRC  or  the
    Home Office.  It was for that reason that his application  was  refused
    on general grounds.  It was that conclusion which also underpinned  the
    respondent's subsequent decision on the second appellant's application.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appeals came before the judge on 9 May 2019.  The  appellants  were
    present  but  unrepresented.   The  respondent  was  represented  by  a
    Presenting Officer.  The Presenting Officer applied for an  adjournment
    on the basis that the respondent had failed to produce a bundle in  the
    first appellant's case.  The judge understandably felt that it was  not
    in the interests of justice to adjourn the appeal for that  reason  and
    he proceeded with  the  hearing.   He  received  oral  and  documentary
    evidence from both appellants and a submission from Presenting  Officer
    and both appellants.  He then reserved his decision.

 5. The judge issued separate decisions  on  the  appeals.   In  the  first
    appellant's appeal, he found that the  respondent  had  discharged  the
    burden of proving that his conduct in 2011/2012 had been dishonest.  He
    found that the appellant had either deceived the respondent in order to
    earn the requisite number of 'points' under  Tier  1  or  that  he  had
    deceived HMRC in order to reduce his tax  liability:  [16].   He  found
    that the general grounds for refusal were accordingly made out and that
    the interference proposed with the first appellant's private  life  was
    justified  and  proportionate  in  the  circumstances:  [17]-[25].   He
    carried his primary finding of fact across into the second  appellant's
    appeal, which was dismissed on Article 8 ECHR grounds for like reasons.




The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The appellants instructed solicitors to  assist  them  at  this  stage.
    Advice was sought and grounds were subsequently settled by Mr Dhanji of
    counsel.  Three grounds were advanced:

      i) The judge had erred in law  in  failing  to  consider  of  his  own
         volition  whether  to  adjourn  the  hearing  so  that  the   first
         appellant's accountant could attend to give oral evidence;


     ii) The judge had failed to apply the correct approach, as disclosed by
         cases including Balajigari and R (Khan)  v  SSHD  [2018]  UKUT  384
         (IAC); [2019] Imm AR 239; and

    iii) The judge had failed to take into account the answers given by  the
         first appellant in  the  questionnaire  he  had  completed  at  the
         respondent's request.

 7. It will be noted that the each of these grounds relates specifically to
    the determination of the dishonesty allegation in the first appellant's
    appeal.  As counsel noted  in  the  grounds  of  appeal,  however,  the
    judge's finding of dishonesty on the part of the first appellant formed
    the essential foundation for the dismissal of both appeals.  Permission
    was granted by Judge O'Brien on each of these grounds.


 8. The appellants  appeared  before  me  in  person,  although  they  were
    accompanied by a  gentleman  who  was  said  to  have  been  the  first
    appellant's accountant at the material time.  The first appellant  told
    me that they had been unable to pay for lawyers to  represent  them  at
    the hearing because he was not permitted to work.

 9. I explained that the issue before the Upper Tribunal was whether  there
    was a legal error in the decision made by the FtT.  I ensured that  the
    appellants had copies of the salient documents (including  the  grounds
    of appeal and the decisions of the FtT) and  that  they  were  able  to
    follow  the  hearing  in  English.   These  preliminaries  having  been
    completed, Mr Jarvis helpfully indicated that he  intended  to  make  a
    concession and that it might assist if  I  heard  from  him  first.   I
    agreed to do so.

10. Mr Jarvis indicated that the respondent was prepared to accept that the
    judge had fallen into procedural  error  in  the  manner  contended  in
    ground one.  The grounds of appeal which had been  settled  by  counsel
    provided  the  context  in  which  the  complaint  was  advanced.   The
    appellants were unrepresented and the judge's approach should have been
    informed by Chapter 1 of the Equal Treatment Bench  Book,  which  deals
    with Litigants in Person and Lay Representatives.  This was a  case  in
    which the first  appellant  had  stated  all  along  that  it  was  his
    accountant who was at fault in respect  of  the  relevant  tax  return.
    There were letters from his accountant but no  witness  statement,  and
    the accountant had not attended the hearing.  When asked about the non-
    attendance of his accountant, the first appellant had said that he  was
    willing to attend but that he, the appellant, was not  aware  that  the
    accountant would  be  permitted  to  attend.   The  judge  nevertheless
    proceeded to hold against the appellant the absence of  detail  in  the
    accountant's letters  and  the  absence  of  the  accountant  from  the
    hearing.  Had the appellants been represented,  that  would  have  been
    entirely proper.  In the circumstances of this case, however, and given
    the guidance in Chapter 1 of the ETBB, the judge should at  least  have
    considered  whether  the  appellants  should  have  been  afforded   an
    opportunity to bring the accountant to the hearing.


11. Mr Jarvis submitted that these concerns were exacerbated  by  the  fact
    that a number  of  points  which  had  been  taken  against  the  first
    appellant did not appear to have been put to him.  An example  of  this
    difficulty was at [13] of the judge's decision, in which  he  expressed
    doubt about the accountant's written explanation  for  the  discrepancy
    (which was that he had muddled the appellant's earnings with  those  of
    another client) because the accountant said 'nothing about whether  the
    appellant saw the tax return'.  The manner in which that  concern,  and
    others on page five of the judge's decision was phrased, suggested that
    the point had not been put to the appellant.  If, as  was  clearly  the
    case, these concerns were to form  a  prominent  part  of  the  judge's
    assessment of the first appellant's truthfulness, they should have been
    raised with him.  It was far from clear that any such points  had  been
    put to the appellant, whether by  the  Presenting  Officer  or  by  the
    judge.


12. In the circumstances, Mr Jarvis submitted that the appellants  had  not
    had a fair hearing and that the correct course was for the appeal to be
    allowed and remitted to another judge at Taylor House for determination
    afresh.  He added two observations.  Firstly, that the  Upper  Tribunal
    was not bound by the respondent's concession and was required  to  take
    its own view on the question posed by s12 of the Tribunals, Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (ie whether the decision of the  FtT  contained  a
    material error of law).  Secondly, that in making the concession he had
    made, he did not intend any criticism of the judge, who  was  doubtless
    facing a heavy  list  and  an  appellant  who  gave  no  indication  of
    requiring an adjournment.   In  these  circumstances,  it  was  perhaps
    understandable that the judge had not turned  his  mind  fully  to  the
    question of what was necessary in order to ensure that this  particular
    appellant had a fair hearing.

Discussion

13. I indicated at the hearing that I agreed with all that  Mr  Jarvis  had
    said.  I accept, in particular, that the judge  erred  procedurally  in
    failing to consider of his own volition whether to adjourn the  hearing
    so that the appellant's accountant could attend.  The letters which had
    been written by the accountant were plainly inadequate.  As  the  judge
    noted at [11] of his careful decision, they were 'brief and  devoid  of
    detail'.  It  was,  as  the  judge  also  noted,  'remarkable'  that  a
    professional accountant could muddle two clients' files and reduce  the
    first appellant's self-employed earnings by �32,000 as a result.  These
    were proper concerns but the appellants were unrepresented.   They  had
    received no professional  assistance  with  the  preparation  of  their
    cases.  When the absence of the accountant was raised  with  the  first
    appellant, he is recorded to have said to the judge that the accountant
    was willing to attend court.  Given the guidance in Chapter One of  the
    ETBB, I agree with Mr Jarvis that it was incumbent on the judge,  as  a
    result of these circumstances, to consider whether it was necessary  to
    give the first appellant an opportunity  to  bring  the  accountant  to
    court to respond to the concerns in the judge's mind.  I  am  satisfied
    that this was a procedural error which  vitiated  the  judge's  central
    conclusion that the first appellant had employed deception in his  past
    dealings with the respondent and/or HMRC.

14. Given the nature of the error in the FtT's decision, the proper  relief
    is for the appeal to be remitted to the FtT for redetermination de novo
    by a judge other than Judge White.  I explained to the first  appellant
    at the hearing that this would be the outcome and I said that  I  would
    make directions at the end of my decision, enabling him and his  former
    accountant to understand what would be necessary in advance of the next
    hearing.  Those directions are as follows:


    In the event that the appellants intend to rely on oral or  documentary
    evidence from the first appellant's former accountant, they  must  send
    the following to the First-tier Tribunal  no  later  than  14  days  in
    advance of the next hearing:

      i)  Evidence  of  the  accountant's  identity  and  his   professional
         standing;
     ii) A statement written by the accountant, explaining in detail how  he
         came to confuse two client files with the  result  that  the  first
         appellant's earnings were reduced by �32,000;
    iii) Contemporaneous evidence in support of the statement  at  (ii),  if
         necessary suitably redacted so as to protect the  identity  of  any
         third party.

15. I also explained to the first appellant and his  accountant  that  they
    would be well advised to read Judge White's decision  carefully  before
    attempting to comply with these directions.  As I  said  to  them,  the
    reason that the judge's decision has been set aside is not because  the
    concerns he expressed were in  any  way  invalid;  it  is  because  the
    appellants were not given an opportunity  to  address  those  concerns.
    They now have that opportunity and it is imperative that they  use  it.
    In the event that they  require  further  explanation  (but  not  legal
    advice) in advance of the hearing before the FtT, they are always  able
    to make contact with one of the FtT's Caseworkers at Taylor House.

Notice of Decision

The decisions issued by the First-tier Tribunal were erroneous  in  law  and
are set aside.  The appeals are remitted to a judge other than Judge P-J  S.
White for hearing de novo.

No anonymity direction is made.
