                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against a  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Callender Smith.  For ease of  reference,  I  shall
    refer throughout this determination to the Secretary of State, who  was
    the original  respondent,  as  "the  Secretary  of  State"  and  to  Mr
    Alruwali, who was the original appellant, as "the claimant".

 2. The claimant, who is  a  citizen  of  Saudi  Arabia,  was  born  on  14
    September 1983.  He entered this  country  on  a  student  visa  on  28
    October 2010, in order to study at the London Metropolitan  University.
    This visa did not expire until October 2013.

 3. While here, he had difficulties with this university, and his  ID  card
    did not work.  His case is that a security guard  told  him  that  this
    card had expired, and he had to apply again. He says that a tutor  gave
    him similar assurances.

 4. The claimant went back to Saudi Arabia for a holiday, but  returned  to
    the  university  in  February  2012  when  he  was  informed  that  his
    registration had been terminated.  Following an unsuccessful appeal  to
    that university, he enrolled at  Birkbeck  College,  and  paid  �12,000
    towards a first-year course running from 2012 to 2013.

 5. While in the UK, the claimant had met Keely Williams,  a  UK  national,
    and they had commenced a relationship in or about October  2011.   They
    married, in the UK, on 11 May 2012.

 6. On 24 September 2012, while lawfully present in this  country  (on  the
    basis of the  leave  originally  granted)  the  appellant  applied  for
    further leave to remain as a spouse of a British citizen, following his
    marriage. That application is dated 20 September 2012.  The application
    was refused by the Secretary of State on 27 March 2013 and the  refusal
    letter is dated  the  same  date.   The  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    satisfied that the claimant  had  produced  an  English  language  test
    certificate as required under the Rules, and also considered  that  the
    claimant  had not provided satisfactory evidence of income as  required
    under the Rules, because he had failed to provide bank  statements  for
    the requisite six month period.   Further,  it  was  the  Secretary  of
    State's case that the claimant's leave to enter had been curtailed such
    that permission expired on 26 June 2012. Accordingly,  as  he  did  not
    have valid leave to remain at the time of making  his  application,  he
    had no right of appeal.

 7.  The claimant appealed against this decision and his appeal  was  heard
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Callender  Smith,  sitting  at  Taylor
    House on 1 November 2013, who, in a  determination  promulgated  on  11
    November 2013, allowed the claimant's appeal, under Article 8.

 8. Judge Callender Smith found, as a preliminary issue, that the  claimant
    had never received the curtailment notice which had been  sent  by  the
    Secretary of State, and that accordingly he remained entitled to be  in
    this country at the time he made his application.  Accordingly, he  had
    an in-country right of appeal.

 9. Although Judge Callender Smith  agreed  that  the  claimant  could  not
    succeed under the Rules,  nonetheless,  he  allowed  the  appeal  under
    Article 8.

10. The Secretary of State has appealed  against  this  decision,  and  was
    granted permission to appeal by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hemingway  on
    29 November 2013.

11. When giving his reasons for  allowing  the  claimant's  appeal,  having
    heard the evidence of the claimant and his wife, the judge accepted it.
      He  accepted  that  they  had  been  in  a  committed  and   enduring
    relationship since October 2011, when they had started living together,
    and that they had subsequently married on 11 May 2012.  They  had  been
    together for over two years, for most  of  that  period  as  a  married
    couple (at para 33).

12. The judge accepted also that as  a  consequence  of  the  marriage  the
    claimant's wife had become completely  estranged  from  her  UK  family
    because she had married a Muslim, and that the claimant's wife  was  at
    the time of the hearing about six months pregnant, and was expecting  a
    child towards the end of January 2014.  He considered that  the  couple
    had a "quite reasonable plan" (at para 34) that the claimant would look
    after the chid after birth, so that his wife could  go back to work  as
    soon as possible; she had a good job ,  from  which  she  earned  about
    �30,000 a year.

13. The judge found further that to expect the claimant to return to  Saudi
    Arabia in order to complete a settlement visa application in order that
    he could return in a reasonable time, was a  process  that  could  take
    months, and that it would not be proportionate to  require  him  to  do
    this.

14. It is asserted in the grounds that the  appeal  should  not  have  been
    allowed, because such an appeal could only be allowed on the basis that
    it is "exceptional in some way" and that this means that the refusal to
    allow the claimant to stay  must  "result  in  an  unjustifiably  harsh
    outcome".   It  is  also  asserted  that  "the  sole   basis   of   the
    proportionality assessment appears to be the advanced pregnancy of  the
    [ claimant's wife]" and it is asserted that "this cannot be  sufficient
    grounds on which to make a proportionality finding."

15.  Although,  when  granting  permission  to  appeal,   Judge   Hemingway
    considered that Judge Callender Smith had "conducted a  full  and  fair
    assessment  of  the  circumstances  having  heard  evidence  from   the
    [claimant] and  his partner", and also  considered  that  it  was  "not
    right to say the judge resolved the proportionality issue solely on the
    basis of  the  pregnancy  but  took  into  account  findings  that  the
    relationship is genuine and the partner has become estranged  from  her
    family" he nonetheless considered that

         "It is arguable the judge should  have  considered  the  extent  to
         which the appeal failed under the Rules as part of  the  Article  8
         assessment and should have asked whether, in light of such failure,
         it was the  case  that  there  were  compelling  circumstances  not
         sufficiently recognised under the Rules  which  would  justify  the
         allowing of the appeal".

The Hearing

16. I heard submissions on behalf of both parties.  As these are  contained
    in  the  Record  of  Proceedings,  in  which  I  attempted  to   record
    contemporaneously everything which was said during the  course  of  the
    hearing, I shall not set out everything  which  was   said,  but  shall
    refer only to such of the submissions as are necessary for the purposes
    of this determination. However, I have had regard to  everything  which
    was said during the course of the  hearing,  as  well  as  to  all  the
    documents contained within  the  file,  whether  or  not  the  same  is
    referred specifically below.

17. On behalf of the Secretary of State, whose appeal this was, Mr Whitwell
    formally adopted the grounds of appeal, which  he  had  not  personally
    settled.  Essentially, it was the Secretary of State's  case  that  the
    appeal having been dismissed under  the  relevant  Rules,  that  factor
    should have been given greater weight when consideration was  given  to
    the appeal under Article 8.  In  particular,  the  Secretary  of  State
    would wish the Tribunal to have in  mind  the  guidance  given  by  the
    Administrative  Court  in  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),  and   in
    particular at paragraphs 42 and 43.   This  guidance  was  particularly
    relevant where a family life had been established while an  applicant's
    immigration position was precarious.

18. However, when pressed by the Tribunal, Mr  Whitwell  accepted  that  in
    light of the judge's finding that the applicant had not received notice
    of curtailment of his original leave, and thus was  still  entitled  to
    remain in this country at the time he  made  his  application  (and  it
    would follow  during  the  period  when   his  family  life  was  being
    established) he could not rely on this guidance give  by   Sales  J  in
    Nagre, because it could not properly be argued  that  family  life  had
    been established during a period where the  couple  should  have  known
    that the claimant's immigration position was precarious.

19. While Mr Whitwell formally asked the Tribunal to revisit  some  of  the
    findings of fact  which had been made, in particular that  the  process
    of applying for permission to return to this country from outside was a
    "process  that  could  take  months",  he  acknowledged  that  in   the
    circumstances that now existed, which was that there was  now  a  young
    child who had been born, in the event that the  original  decision  was
    set aside, the Secretary of State would then  have  to  establish  that
    there were weighty circumstances making it reasonable for the  claimant
    to return now to Saudi Arabia.  However, he formally asked the Tribunal
    to set aside the decision which had been made.

20. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Chaudhary maintained that the  judge  had
    properly analysed the claimant's personal  circumstances,  which  could
    properly be said to be exceptional.  In the circumstances of this case,
    the judge had been entirely justified in finding that the  consequences
    of the claimant's removal would be unduly harsh for the family life  of
    this couple.

Discussion

21. When considering whether or not  there  is  an  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal, I must consider the  position
    as it was at the date of that decision.  However, were I to  find  that
    that determination did contain an error of law such that  the  decision
    must be remade, when remaking the decision I would have to have  regard
    to the situation as it is now.  As Mr Whitwell accepted, the claimant's
    position is stronger now, because the interests of  his child, who  has
    now been born, would also have to be considered.

22. It is apparent from the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  that
    the judge considered the claimant's  circumstances,  and  that  of  his
    family, very carefully.  Although  it  is  right  that  the  claimant's
    application could not have succeeded under the Rules,  because  he  had
    not satisfied the technical requirements under the Rules, the judge was
    entitled to take account of the facts, as he found them to be, that the
    couple did in fact have adequate funds to provide for their  reasonable
    maintenance  and that  without  the  claimant's  presence,  the  family
    unit would potentially not be viable economically  once  the  expected
    child had been born.  The judge was also entitled to take into  account
    that the time it would take for  the  claimant  to  complete  his  visa
    application  from  abroad  and  then   be   allowed   to   return   was
    unpredictable.

23.  Although  the  judge  did  not  give  specific  consideration  in  his
    determination to the House of Lords' decision in Chikwamba [2008]  UKHL
    40 or the subsequent Court of Appeal decision in Hayat [2012] EWCA  Civ
    1054, in my judgement had he done so  he  would  have  appreciated,  in
    light of his other findings, that  the  claimant's  position  was  even
    stronger.  While Article 8 should not and cannot be used  merely  as  a
    long-stop to allow an appeal to succeed where the Rules have  not  been
    satisfied, even if only by a small margin, this is  not  such  a  case.
    This claimant clearly had a substantial family life  in  this  country,
    which was established when he had a right to be here, and the rights of
    his English wife have to be considered, in light (at the  time  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision) of her pregnancy.  Now, of course, were I
    to be remaking the decision, I would have to take account also  of  the
    rights of the child who has been born.

24. In my judgement, the First-tier  Tribunal  was  entirely  justified  in
    finding that it  would  be  wholly  disproportionate  to  require  this
    claimant to leave this country in order to  make  an  application  from
    abroad, given his good standing here, the fact that the unit,  so  long
    as he was here, was economically viable, and the substantial and  harsh
    disruption to the family life which would be occasioned by his  removal
    at a time when his presence was particularly important.

25. It was apparent to the judge (as  it  was  apparent  to  this  Tribunal
    during the hearing)  that  the  claimant  and  his  wife  "have  had  a
    committed and enduring relationship" (at  paragraph  33)  and  he  also
    found that the claimant's wife had become  "completely  estranged  from
    her UK family because she [had] married a Muslim".  Were this  claimant
    to have been removed, there would have been no one  in  the  claimant's
    wife's family to whom she could have turned for support  once the child
    had been  born in order that she could  go back to work.

26. In all the circumstances of this case, and  in  light  of  the  judge's
    clear findings of fact, as set out above, he was entirely justified  in
    finding  that  the  removal  of  this  claimant,  in  order  to  ensure
    compliance with the Rules, would not be proportionate. In my judgement,
    given the judge's findings, it is difficult to see how  he  could  have
    come to any other conclusion, and the Secretary of State's appeal  must
    accordingly be dismissed, and I will so find.



Decision

27. The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed; the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal, allowing the  claimant's  appeal  under  Article  8,  is
    affirmed.owHoHowHows
