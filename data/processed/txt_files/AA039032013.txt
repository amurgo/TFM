Representation:

For the Secretary of State:     Ms J Isherwood
For the Respondent:    Mr A Eaton, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lobo allowing the appeal  of  the
    respondent against refusal to grant him asylum in the UK.

2.   The Respondent is a citizen of Egypt born on  16  September  1980.   He
    arrived in the UK on 8 June  2012  on  his  own  passport,  with  entry
    clearance as a Tier 4 Student valid from 26  May  2012  until  1  April
    2013.  He travelled back to Egypt on  18  February  2013  to  attend  a
    family funeral service and returned to the UK on 28 February  2013  and
    applied for asylum on 4 March 2013.  His application  was  refused  for
    the reasons set out in the  respondent's  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter
    dated 9 April 2013.

3.   The judge heard oral evidence from the respondent.  In support  of  his
    appeal the respondent submitted an expert report by  Dr  Mariz  Tadros.
    Dr Tadros described  his  relevant  experience  to  comment  on  issues
    relating to  Coptic  Christians  in  Egypt  in  the  brief  CV  in  his
    curriculum vitae.

4.   The judge found that  the  evidence  of  the  respondent  contained  in
    various forms made  as  a  consequence  of  his  application  had  been
    factually consistent and was supported by the  background  material  to
    which he had referred and the  country  guidance  case  of  MS  (Coptic
    Christians) Egypt CG [2013] UKUT 00611 (IAC).

5.   As a consequence the judge found that the  respondent  was  a  credible
    witness and made the following findings of fact.  The respondent  is  a
    Coptic Christian.  He was asked to pay Jizya when he ran a bookshop  in
    Alexandria.   His  girlfriend  was  kidnapped.   Efforts  made  by  the
    respondent to have her released resulted in his address and name  being
    identified.

6.   He made an application within the Immigration Rules  to  study  English
    in the United Kingdom and was granted the appropriate  visa  which  was
    valid from 26 May 2012 to 1 April 2013.  He returned  to  Egypt  on  18
    February 2013 to attend a funeral service for his mother's late  cousin
    to whom he was  close.   He  returned  to  the  United  Kingdom  on  28
    February.

7.   During the time he was in Egypt, his windscreen  was  destroyed  on  20
    February 2013 and a  message  was  left  on  his  car  saying  "prepare
    yourself for slaughtering".  He reported this matter to the police with
    the assistance of his solicitor.  At about midnight on 23 February 2013
    the respondent was assaulted by three Salafists who threatened him with
    a knife and tore the long sleeve top he was wearing with the knife  and
    he was told, "next time you will be killed".

8.   Applying his findings of fact to  the  background  material,  including
    the country guidance case of MS and the expert report, the judge  found
    that the respondent fell within  the  risk  category  (iv)  i.e.  those
    accused of being physically or emotionally involved with a Muslim woman
    where the accusation is made seriously and not  casually,  and  he  has
    been forced to pay security money.  Moreover  in  accordance  with  the
    risk factor (6) of MS the respondent comes from an area where the local
    Coptic population faces a real risk of persecution (the last  paragraph
    of Nour El Shams' report of the appellant's supplementary bundle).

9.   The judge found that the respondent is at risk  for  his  human  rights
    and church activities which accords with paragraph  144  of  MS.   With
    regard to internal flight, the judge found that this was not an  option
    for the respondent.  He has been actively pursued by the Salafists  who
    kidnapped his fianc�e and his efforts to free her resulted in him being
    identified by both name and address.   Furthermore,  Dr  Tadros  stated
    that there are no safe areas for Copts to seek refuge from assault.  In
    light of these reasons the judge allowed  the  respondent's  appeal  on
    asylum grounds and human rights grounds.

10.  The appellant appealed on grounds which  argued  that  the  judge  gave
    inadequate  consideration  to  the  facts,  issues  or  challenges   to
    credibility raised in the  refusal  letter  and  provided  insufficient
    reasons for findings for positive credibility or  fact,  which  were  a
    material error of law as the judge did not follow the case law MK (duty
    to give  reasons)  Pakistan  [2013]  UKUT  00641  (IAC),  that  a  bare
    statement whether the witness was or was not credible  is  unlikely  to
    satisfy the requirement to give reasons. Permission was granted on  the
    basis that the determination  showed  that  evidence  was  inadequately
    recited or analysed and there was  little  by  way  of  cogent  factual
    findings.

11.  Ms Isherwood relied on these grounds.  She said that the  Secretary  of
    State accepted the respondent's nationality and religion  but  did  not
    accept his profile or the events he relied on  to  support  his  asylum
    claim.  The determination does not identify the evidence that outweighs
    the Secretary of State's position.

12.  Having considered the submissions and the evidence that was before  the
    judge, I accept Counsel's submission  that  the  judge  considered  the
    respondent's case in the context of MS.  The judge's finding  that  the
    respondent's girlfriend was kidnapped accords with the headnote 4 of MS
    i.e. that Coptic Christian women in Egypt are not in general at risk of
    persecution or ill-treatment although they face difficulties additional
    to  other  women  in  the  form  of  sometimes  being  the  target   of
    disappearances, forced abduction and forced  conversion.  I  find  that
    this finding also accords with the  extracts  from  Dr  Tadros'  report
    which are set out by the judge at paragraph  17(f)(i)  and  (ii).    At
    paragraph 19 the judge found that the respondent falls within the  risk
    category identified in headnote 3(iv) of MS, namely, those  accused  of
    being physically or emotionally involved with a Muslim woman where  the
    accusation is made seriously and not casually, and he has  been  forced
    to pay security money.

13.  The judge's finding at paragraph 19 also relies on  objective  evidence
    which accords with paragraph 144 of MS which says:

         "We also think Mr Marshall's suggested additional category of those
         who are outspoken about their religion  and  work  visibly  in  the
         community is  overbroad  because  there  is  little  evidence  that
         Christian activists have been targeted in attacks  or  that  Coptic
         political organisations have been targeted.  On the other  hand  in
         an individual case, if a Christian activist is  able  to  establish
         that he or she has or would be targeted, that may well  suffice  to
         cause them to be at greater risk than ordinary Copts."

14.  At paragraph 20 the judge found that internal flight was not an  option
    for the  respondent.   The  respondent  was  actively  pursued  by  the
    Salafists who kidnapped  his  fianc�e  and  his  efforts  to  free  her
    resulted  in  him  being  identified  both   by   name   and   address.
    Furthermore, Dr. Tadros stated that there are no safe areas  for  Copts
    to seek refuge from assaults.

15.  The appellant's grounds complain that the judge did not deal  with  the
    credibility issues raised in the Reasons for Refusal letter.

16.  At paragraph 32 of the RFRL the  Secretary  of  State  noted  that  the
    Salafists whom the respondent claimed to have been responsible for  the
    threats  against  him  were  non-state  actors  and  that  it  is   the
    responsibility of the Egyptian authorities  to  provide  him  with  the
    necessary security. The Secretary of State went  on  to  say  that  the
    respondent's claim that "there is no police" is not consistent with the
    information in the COI  Service  bulletins  in  September  2012  and  9
    January 2013 that President Morsi has made many concessions  in  trying
    to accommodate the views and rights of  citizens  in  Egypt,  including
    Coptic Christians.  At paragraph 33 the  Secretary  of  State  did  not
    accept that the respondent was targeted  as  a  result  of  his  Coptic
    Christian faith due to the profile he had.  Paragraph  34  stated  that
    the police report the respondent had  submitted  was  not  an  original
    document and therefore carried no weight in the  round.   Paragraph  35
    stated that the respondent had produced no  evidence  to  suggest  that
    either his fianc�e was kidnapped or the police were unwilling or unable
    to help; he did not know how the men who threatened  him  by  telephone
    were able to obtain his phone number.  It was not considered  plausible
    that he made just one attempt to solicit the help of the authorities in
    finding his fianc�e.  Paragraph 36 rejected his claim  that  he  has  a
    profile as a  Coptic  Christian  consistent  with  being  targeted  for
    persecution.  Paragraph 38 did not accept the respondent's  explanation
    as to how the actors of persecution knew he had returned to  Egypt  and
    at paragraph 39 said that he did not report this incident to the police
    and therefore his account was inconsistent with his earlier claim  that
    he went to report other threats to the  police.   Paragraph  40  stated
    that the respondent originally arrived in the  UK  in  June  2012.   He
    claimed to have been threatened in August 2011 but waited  another  ten
    months before leaving Egypt, his intention in coming to the UK  was  to
    study but noted that he went back to Egypt in February  2013  returning
    to the UK on 28th February 2013 and did  not  claim  asylum  until  5th
    March 2013.  It was considered that his actions  in  both  leaving  and
    returning to Egypt were not consistent with someone genuinely  in  fear
    of their life, for  these  reasons  the  appellant  rejected  that  the
    respondent experienced problems due to  being  a  Coptic  Christian  as
    claimed by him.

17.  I accept Counsel's submission that these  are  not  meaningful  grounds
    for doubting the respondent's credibility.  The Secretary of State  did
    not identify any  serious  inconsistencies  in  the  respondent's  core
    account.  Whilst I find that the judge failed to consider the delay  in
    claiming asylum, the fact that he remained  in  Egypt  for  ten  months
    after the kidnap of his fianc�e, his return to Egypt and his return  to
    the UK and claiming asylum seven days thereafter, I do  not  find  that
    these matters outweigh  the  judge's  finding  that  the  core  of  the
    respondent's  account  was  consistent,  not  only  with  the   various
    materials set out by the respondent but also accorded with the  country
    guidance decision of MS and the report by Dr Tadros.

18.  For these reasons I find that the judge's decision was  not  materially
    flawed.  The judge's decision allowing the  respondent's  appeal  shall
    stand.
