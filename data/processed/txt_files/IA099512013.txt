For the Appellant:     Mr M Blundell, Counsel, instructed by Messrs Rashid
& Rashid
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan born in  November  1986,  appeals,
    with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    Thomas who in a determination promulgated on 3 September 2013 dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  Secretary  of  State
    made on 18 March 2013 to refuse him leave to remain as a spouse.

2.   The appellant entered Britain as a student in June  2010  and  received
    an extension of stay as a student until 2013.  He married the  sponsor,
    Ms S in May 2012 and in October 2012 applied for an extension of  leave
    as a spouse.  His wife is a British citizen of Indian descent who was a
    Hindu but converted to the Muslim religion when she married.

3.   The appellant's application was refused  on  three  grounds  under  the
    provisions of paragraph R-LTRP 1.1. It was alleged that he did not meet
    the requirements of E-LTRP  2.2  as  he  had  been  in  breach  of  the
    immigration laws because he had worked while a student  for  more  than
    the twenty hours permitted per week.  He  was also refused on the basis
    that it had not been shown that the sponsor  had  a  sufficiently  high
    income - ï¿½18,600.  Finally he was refused on the basis that he did  not
    have the appropriate English language certificate.

4.   Judge  Thomas  found  that  the  appellant  met  the  English  language
    requirements and furthermore that the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules were met.  She found that  the  appellant  had  on  a  number  of
    occasions taken employment in excess of the permitted twenty hours  and
    therefore found that he had breached  the  conditions  of  his  student
    visa. On that basis she found that the appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.

5.   She went on to consider the appellant's rights under Article 8  of  the
    ECHR, applying the relevant structured approach.  She  considered  that
    the appellant had established family and private life in Britain,  that
    his removal would be an interference with the exercise of those  rights
    but that the interference would be both in accordance with the law  and
    necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security
    and public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country.

6.   She then considered the issue of proportionality emphasising  that  she
    accepted the appellant was in a subsisting marriage but stating that he
    had entered into the marriage in the  knowledge  that  his  status  was
    temporary and dependent upon him meeting the necessary requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.  She wrote:-

         "Whilst I accept that the sponsor is a British  citizen  of  Indian
         origin living with her parents in the United Kingdom, and  may  not
         wish to leave the United Kingdom  to  accompany  the  appellant  to
         Pakistan, there is no evidence to show that she is not able  to  do
         so, and it is not necessarily unreasonable to expect her to do  so.
         In the alternative she is supported by her parents  with  whom  she
         lives and is in a position to support any further  application  for
         entry clearance the appellant may make."

7.   In paragraph 21 she referred to the judgment of the House of  Lords  in
    Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 and stated that the public  interest  required
    the upholding  of  the  effective  immigration  control  and  that  the
    legitimate aim relied on by the respondent outweighed  the  appellant's
    right to respect for  his  family  and  private  life.   She  therefore
    considered the decision was proportionate.

8.   The appellant appealed. The grounds of appeal  dealt  solely  with  the
    issue of the rights of the appellant under Article 8 of the ECHR.  They
    argued that the decision on the issue of proportionality was  in  error
    as the  judge  had  not  assessed  all  the  relevant  factors  and  in
    particular had not placed  sufficient  weight  on  the  fact  that  the
    sponsor was a British citizen of Indian  origin.  They  questioned  the
    statement by the judge that there was  no  evidence  that  the  sponsor
    would not be permitted to join the appellant in Pakistan.

9.   Having  referred  to  the  determination  of  the  Tribunal  in  Izuazu
    (Article 8 - new Rules) [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC) and the judgment of  Blake
    J in MM v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) it was claimed that  the  judge
    had failed to weigh the appellant's wife's rights as a British national
    when considering the proportionality of removal and in then  dismissing
    the appeal.

10.  They went on to argue that the judge should have considered whether  or
    not the appellant's family life could  reasonably  be  expected  to  be
    enjoyed elsewhere and stated there was an error of law in that she  did
    not do so. Having referred to the judgment of the  House  of  Lords  in
    Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39 it was  argued  that  the  judge  had
    failed to apply the guidance therein.

11.  The Secretary of State issued a short Rule 24  statement  arguing  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had directed  herself  appropriately  and
    that the grounds did not disclose any arguable  error  of  law  in  the
    determination.  The respondent emphasized that  Article  8  should  not
    normally be used to bypass the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

12.  In his submissions Mr Blundell referred to the importance Blake  J  had
    placed on the British nationality of a sponsor in the  judgment  in  MM
    and the fact that to refuse the appellant leave to remain was  what  he
    had called a constructive denial of her entitlement to family life.  He
    referred to the judge's comments regarding "insurmountable obstacles" -
    the test used in paragraph 15 of the determination when the  judge  had
    said that she  had  found  that  the  evidence   had  not  demonstrated
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  elsewhere.  He
    referred to paragraph 49 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal  in  MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 which emphasised that reasonableness was
    a factor which should be taken into account when assessing the  concept
    of insurmountable obstacles.  In that paragraph the Master of the Rolls
    had stated that:

         "We would observe that, if 'insurmountable obstacle' are  literally
         obstacles which it is impossible to surmount, their scope  is  very
         limited indeed. We shall confine ourselves to saying  that  we  are
         inclined to the view that, for the reasons stated in detail by  the
         UTJ In Izuazu paragraphs 53 to 59, such a stringent approach  would
         be contrary to Article 8."

13.  Moreover he argued that the judge had not followed  the  ratio  of  the
    judgment in Chikwamba when she had considered whether  or  not  it  was
    sensible to expect the appellant to return to Pakistan and  apply  from
    there.  While he accepted that the appellant and the  sponsor  did  not
    have a child, he emphasised that it should only be comparatively rarely
    that an appellant should be expected to return when  their  application
    was likely to succeed.

14.  He emphasised that in paragraph 20 of the determination the  judge  had
    referred to it being  "not  necessarily  unreasonable"  to  expect  the
    sponsor to join the appellant in Pakistan and stated that not only  was
    that test, as applied by the judge, unclear but  it  was  also  not  an
    appropriate test given the terms of the Master of the  Rolls'  judgment
    in MF.

15.  In reply Mr Deller stated that it was clear that the  judge  was  aware
    of the British citizenship of the sponsor and stated that the judge was
    also aware  of  the  possible  difficulties  which  he  might  face  in
    Pakistan.  He argued, however, that the judge had properly applied  the
    law, reaching conclusions within the relevant framework. In  particular
    he argued that there was nothing to indicate it would be impossible for
    the appellant to make an application from abroad and  stated  therefore
    that he did not consider that the terms of the  judgment  in  Chikwamba
    had been  met.

16.  He accepted that the appellant's breach of conditions in working  extra
     hours was not a breach  such  that  it  would  be  unlikely  that  the
    appellant would be refused entry but stated that it was a factor  which
    would be taken into account.

17.  We found that there were material errors of law  in  the  determination
    of the Immigration Judge in the way in which she dealt with the  rights
    of the appellant  under  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.   We  consider,  in
    particular,  that  her  approach  to  the  issue   of   "insurmountable
    obstacles" to the family life continuing elsewhere was not sufficiently
    nuanced in the way which was indicated in the judgment of the Master of
    Rolls in MF (Nigeria) and we had difficulty in  following  her  comment
    that there was no evidence to show that the sponsor was not able to  go
    to Pakistan and it was "not necessarily unreasonable" to expect her  to
    do so.  We consider that there were a  number of factors  which  should
    have been taken into account when reaching a conclusion on  whether  or
    not the sponsor could be  expected  to  go  to  Pakistan  particularly,
    following the judgment of Blake J in MM that the sponsor is British.

18.  We therefore set aside the decision of the Immigration Judge.

19.  We considered that it was appropriate that we should proceed to  remake
    the decision.  We, of course, only remake the decision with  regard  to
    the appellant's rights under Article 8 of the ECHR.  In that regard  we
    accept that the appellant and his wife are in a subsisting marriage and
    that there would be an interference  with  their  family  life  if  the
    appellant  were  removed.   We  place  weight  on  the  terms  of   the
    Immigration Rules and note that it is not  argued  that  the  appellant
    could succeed within the Rules but would comment that the  reason  that
    he does not - the fact it was considered that he worked more hours than
    he was entitled to as a student was a breach of  the  Rules  -  and  we
    would empathise that we take seriously any breach of the  Rules  -  was
    not a breach which could be characterised as  being  towards  the  most
    serious end of the spectrum of breaches of conditions.   We  would,  in
    any event, point out that we consider that there is likely to  be  some
    merit in the appellant's comment  that  the  additional  hours  he  was
    working were not during term time.

20.  Be that as it may, that breach of the Rules is  a  matter  which  would
    lead to us finding that the removal of the appellant was, absent  other
    factors, not disproportionate. However,  we  consider  that  there  are
    important other factors.  In particular, the fact that the  appellant's
    wife is British and that she is of Indian descent.  She has never lived
    in Pakistan and although she is now a Muslim she was a Hindu until  she
    married.  We consider that she would  face  difficulties  therefore  in
    Pakistan notwithstanding the fact that she speaks Urdu.  We  would  add
    that we consider that she would face further difficulties as she  would
    not receive support from the appellant's family who do not  approve  of
    the marriage.  We note moreover that the appellant has never overstayed
    in Britain and that he has studied,  successfully,  here.  We  consider
    that he would qualify for entry but would not be able to do so  if  his
    wife accompanied  him as she would not be working. Noting the  comments
    of the master of the Rolls in MF we consider that there  factors  would
    amount to the "insurmountable obstacles" as to which reference is  made
    in section EX.1.(b)  of appendix FM of the rules.

21.  Taking all these factors into account and placing particular weight  on
    the terms of the Rules we conclude that the removal  of  the  appellant
    would be a disproportionate interference of his rights under Article  8
    of the ECHR.

22.  We therefore, having set aside the  determination  of  the  Immigration
    Judge, re-make the decision and  allow  this  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds.

Decision

23.  This appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.
