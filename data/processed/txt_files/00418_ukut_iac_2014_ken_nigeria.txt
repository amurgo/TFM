If a Tribunal refuses to accede to an  adjournment  request,  such  decision
could, in principle, be erroneous in law in several respects: these  include
a failure to take  into  account  all  material  considerations;  permitting
immaterial considerations to intrude; denying the  party  concerned  a  fair
hearing; failing to apply the correct test;  and  acting  irrationally.   In
practice, in most cases the question will be whether  the  refusal  deprived
the affected party of his right to a fair  hearing.   Where  an  adjournment
refusal is challenged on fairness grounds,  it  is  important  to  recognise
that the question for the Upper  Tribunal  is  not  whether  the  FtT  acted
reasonably.  Rather, the test to be applied is that of fairness:  was  there
any deprivation of the affected party's right to  a  fair  hearing?  See  SH
(Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011]  EWCA  Civ
1284.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


INTRODUCTION

 1. By a decision dated 29 May 2013 on behalf of the Secretary of State for
    the  Home  Department  (the  "Secretary  of  State"),  the  Appellant's
    application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant was refused.   The refusal was based on  an  assessed
    failure to comply with the "Maintenance (Funds)"  requirement,  whereby
    the Appellant was obliged to demonstrate that he had been in possession
    of at least �900 of available funds during a consecutive period  of  90
    days.  The assessment of the bank statements submitted was  that  "....
    the level of available funds fell below �900 on  several  occasions  in
    this period".


DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

 2. The First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT") dismissed the ensuing appeal, on 04
    April 2014.  In its determination, the FtT recorded that neither  party
    was present or represented.    It was further recorded:

         "His solicitors wrote ......   on 31st March indicating  that  they
         had been informed he was ill, but they  were  unable  to  give  any
         further information.  None was forthcoming on 4th April 2014.   The
         solicitors asked for an adjournment or  for  consideration  of  the
         appeal on the papers if the appeal were not adjourned.  In my view,
         there was insufficient information for me to adjourn the appeal  on
         the basis that the Appellant was unfit to attend the  hearing.   In
         my view he failed to show a good  reason  why  an  adjournment  was
         necessary for the purposes [of] paragraph  21  of  the  Asylum  and
         Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


         I have considered  a  copy  of  the  solicitor's  letter  to  which
         reference is made in this passage."


    The letter to which reference is made was written  by  the  Appellant's
    solicitors four days in advance of the hearing.   It states:


         "We write further to our client's appeal hearing on 04  April  2014
         and request for a short adjournment on the ground that we have been
         unable to obtain instructions from our client to enable us  prepare
         properly for the hearing.  We have been informed  that  our  client
         has been ill and all attempts to contact his doctor and hospital to
         provide  us  with  information  about  his  situation  have  proved
         abortive due mainly to legal restraint under  the  Data  Protection
         Act.  We are therefore left with no other option than to  apply  to
         the Tribunal for its indulgence to adjourn the hearing for a  short
         period of time  to  enable  us  obtain  sufficient  instruction  to
         prepare for the hearing. In the event  that  the  Tribunal  is  not
         disposed  to  granting  the  adjournment  sought,  we  respectfully
         request that our client appeal be considered on paper."


         [sic].

     In the same passage, the FtT recorded:

         "Despite standard directions, the Appellant has failed  to  provide
         any evidence in support of his appeal."

    Having decided to determine the appeal as a paper exercise,  the  Judge
    dismissed it in the following terms:


         "The evidence on which the Secretary of State relied in deciding to
         award  the  Appellant  no  points  for  maintenance  has  not  been
         challenged or rebutted. I am not satisfied to the required standard
         that he had sufficient funds to comply with the requirement in  the
         Immigration Rules."

    The Judge  further  opined  that  by  virtue  of  section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 the FtT  was  confined  to
    considering evidence provided by the Appellant at the  time  of  making
    the application culminating in the impugned decision.


APPEAL TO THIS TRIBUNAL

3.   Permission to appeal was granted on the following ground only:

         "The Judge  was  in  error  when  he  refused  an  application  for
         adjournment presented by my  solicitor  even  though  my  solicitor
         clearly informed the Court that I was sick and could not give  them
         a clear brief.  I am recently diagnosed of diabetes and  have  been
         struggling  with  the  medication  ....  going  on  and  off   into
         hyperglycaemia especially on 07/04/14, 08/04/14  and  09/04/14  and
         could hardly do anything  for  myself.   Hence  the  difficulty  in
         giving my solicitors a specific brief ........


         I have attached evidence to show my diabetic condition ......"

    The Appellant did not attend the hearing before this Tribunal  and  was
    not represented.   Having perused the file, it is  evident  that  there
    has been no communication from the Appellant or any  representative  on
    his behalf since the Notice of Appeal was filed on 22 April  2014.   On
    behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Smart invited a dismissal  of  the
    appeal.  He stated that, from the information  available  to  him,  the
    Appellant appeared to have made a further  Tier  1  Application  on  19
    December 2013.  At that stage, his appeal to the FtT was pending,  with
    the result that this further application was "voided" by the  Secretary
    of State's officials.




GOVERNING PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURAL RULES


 4. Rule 19 of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005
    (the "2005 Rules"),  under the rubric "Hearing Appeal in Absence  of  a
    Party", provides:

         "(1) The Tribunal may hear an appeal in the absence of a  party  or
             his representative, if satisfied that -


              i. the party or his representative has been  given  notice  of
                 the date, time and place of the hearing, and


             ii. there is no good reason for such absence."

    This must be considered in conjunction with Rule 21, which states:


         "(1)     Where a party applies for an adjournment of a hearing  of
    an appeal, he must -


               a)  if  practicable,  notify  all  other   parties   of   the
                  application;


               b) show good reason why an adjournment is necessary;  and

               c) provide evidence of any fact  or  matter  relied  upon  in
                  support of the application.


         (2)  The Tribunal must not adjourn a hearing of an  appeal  on  the
             application of a  party,  unless  satisfied  that  the  appeal
             cannot otherwise be justly determined."

    Each of these provisions of the Rules must be construed and applied  by
    reference to the  overriding  objective  enshrined  in  Rule  4,  which
    provides:


         "The  overriding  objective  of  these  Rules  is  to  secure  that
         proceedings before the Tribunal are handled as fairly, quickly  and
         efficiently as possible; and, where appropriate,  that  members  of
         the  Tribunal  have  responsibility  for  ensuring  this,  in   the
         interests of the parties to the proceedings and in the wider public
         interest."

    This is the  provision  of  the  2005  Rules  to  which  the  FtT  was,
    evidently, referring in [4] of its determination.


 5. In the Rules matrix outlined  above,  rule  21(2)  is  a  provision  of
    critical importance.  Its effect is that where a party applies  for  an
    adjournment of a hearing, the Tribunal is obliged, in  every  case,  to
    consider whether the appeal can be "justly determined"  in  the  moving
    party's absence.  If the decision is to refuse  the  application,  this
    must be based on the Tribunal satisfying itself that the appeal can  be
    justly determined in the absence of the party  concerned.   This  means
    that, in principle, there may be cases where an adjournment  should  be
    ordered notwithstanding that the moving party has failed to demonstrate
    good reason for this course.  As a general rule, good reason will  have
    to be demonstrated in order to secure an adjournment. There are  strong
    practical and case management reasons for  this,  particularly  in  the
    contemporary litigation culture with its  emphasis  on  efficiency  and
    expedition. However,  these  considerations,  unquestionably  important
    though they are, must be tempered and applied with the recognition that
    a fundamental common law right, namely the right of every litigant to a
    fair hearing, is engaged.  In any case where  a  question  of  possible
    adjournment arises, this is the dominant  consideration.   It  is  also
    important to recognise that the relevant provisions of the 2005  Rules,
    rehearsed above, do not modify or  dilute,  and  are  the  handmaidens,
    their master, and the common law right in play.

 6. Viewed through this prism, rule 21(2) is to be considered as reflecting
    the common law right engaged. In every case,  the  Tribunal  must  have
    careful regard to rule 21(2).  This provision of  the  Rules  expresses
    the common law right of every party to a fair hearing.  In  considering
    rule 21(1)(b) in tandem with rule 21(2), together with the right  to  a
    fair hearing of the party or parties concerned,  a  balancing  exercise
    must be conducted.  In performing this task, tribunals should be  alert
    to the doctrine of abuse of  process.   In  cases  where  the  Tribunal
    considers that an adjournment  application  is  based  on  spurious  or
    frivolous grounds or is vexatious,  the  requirement  of  demonstrating
    good  reason  will  not  be  satisfied.   However,  this  will  not  be
    determinative of  the  question  of  whether  refusing  an  adjournment
    request would compromise the right to  a  fair  hearing  of  the  party
    concerned.  In  some   cases,   adjournment   applications   based   on
    particularly trivial or unmeritorious  grounds  may  give  rise  to  an
    assessment that the process of the Tribunal is being misused  and  will
    result in a refusal. Tribunals should be very slow to conclude that the
    party concerned has waived its right to a fair hearing or any  discrete
    aspect thereof.  Where any suggestion of this kind arises, it  will  be
    preferable to evaluate the conduct of the party concerned  through  the
    lens of abuse of process and it will always be necessary to give effect
    to both parties' right to a fair hearing.

7.   If a Tribunal  refuses  to  accede  to  an  adjournment  request,  such
    decision could, in principle, be erroneous in law in several  respects:
    these  include  a  failure  to   take   into   account   all   material
    considerations;  permitting  immaterial  considerations   to   intrude;
    denying the party concerned  a  fair  hearing;  failing  to  apply  the
    correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most cases  the
    question will be whether the refusal deprived the affected party of his
    right to a fair hearing.  Where an adjournment refusal is challenged on
    fairness grounds, it is important to recognise that  the  question  for
    the Upper Tribunal is not whether the FtT  acted  reasonably.   Rather,
    the test to be applied is that of fairness:  was there any  deprivation
    of the affected party's right to a  fair  hearing?  Any  temptation  to
    review the conduct  and  decision  of  the  FtT  through  the  lens  of
    reasonableness  must  be  firmly  resisted,  in  order   to   avoid   a
    misdirection in law.  In a nutshell, fairness is the supreme criterion.



8.   The cardinal  rule  rehearsed  above  is  expressed  in  uncompromising
    language in the decision of the Court of Appeal in SH  (Afghanistan)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011]  EWCA  Civ  1284,  at
    [13]:

         "First, when considering whether the  immigration  Judge  ought  to
         have granted an adjournment, the test was not  irrationality.   The
         test was not whether his decision was properly open to him  or  was
         Wednesbury unreasonable or perverse.  The test and  sole  test  was
         whether it was unfair".

     [My emphasis]

     Alertness to this test  by  Tribunals  at  both  tiers  will  serve  to
    prevent judicial error. Regrettably, in the real and imperfect world of
    contemporary  litigation,  the  question  of  adjourning  a  case   not
    infrequently arises on the date of hearing, at the doors of the  court.
    I am conscious, of course, that in the typical case the Judge will have
    invested much time and effort in preparation, is understandably anxious
    to complete the day's list of cases  for  hearing  and  may  well  feel
    frustrated  by  the  (usually)  unexpected  advent  of  an  adjournment
    request.  Both the FtT and the Upper Tribunal have demanding workloads.
     Parties and stakeholders have  expectations,  typically  elevated  and
    sometimes unrealistic, relating to the throughput and output  of  cases
    in the system. In the present era, the spotlight on  the  judiciary  is
    more acute than ever before.   Moreover,  Tribunals  must  consistently
    give effect to the overriding objective. Notwithstanding, sensations of
    frustration and inconvenience, no matter how  legitimate,  must  always
    yield to  the  parties'  right  to  a  fair  hearing.   In  determining
    applications for adjournments, Judges will also be guided by  focussing
    on the overarching criterion enshrined  in  the  overriding  objective,
    which is that of fairness.

9.   In passing, I am conscious that the FtT procedural rules are  scheduled
    to be replaced by a new code which is expected to come  into  operation
    on  20  October  2014.   The  provisions  relating   to   adjournments,
    previously  enshrined  in  rules  19  and   21   (supra),   have   been
    substantially  simplified.   Within  the  new  code,  the  Asylum   and
    Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules 2014[1],  Rule  4(3)(h),  under
    the rubric "Case Management Powers", provides that the FtT -

         "may ...  adjourn or postpone a hearing "


    This substantially less prescriptive formula reinforces  the  necessity
    of giving full effect, in every case,  to  the  common  law  right  and
    principles discussed above. The overriding objective remains unchanged:
    see Rule 2. FtT Judges dealing with adjournment issues should  continue
    to apply the principles rehearsed above and the decision of  the  Court
    of Appeal in SH (Afghanistan),  giving  primacy  to  the  criterion  of
    fairness.


CONCLUSIONS

10.  I consider that the FtT erred in law in deciding that  the  Appellant's
    adjournment application should be refused.  The error consisted of  the
    Tribunal  considering  the  "good  reason"  limb  of  rule  21,   while
    neglecting to consider and apply the "justly determined" provision,  in
    conjunction with the principles outlined above.  In  short,  the  Judge
    failed to apply the dominant test of fairness and  misdirected  himself
    in law in consequence.

11.  The next question which  arises  is  whether  this  error  of  law  was
    material.  I consider that it was not, since the sole question for  the
    FtT was whether, based on an assessment of  the  documentary  evidence,
    the Secretary of State's  decision  was  sustainable.   The  Judge,  in
    answering this question affirmatively, focused  on  the  issue  of  the
    Appellant's earnings.   I  consider  that  this  was  misguided  since,
    properly construed,  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  letter  had
    awarded the Appellant full points [15] in respect of previous earnings.
     As noted above, the key  passage  in  the  decision  letter  was  that
    awarding zero points in response to the Appellant's claim for 10 points
    in respect of maintenance/funds.  The Judge does not advert to this  in
    his determination. This was a further, freestanding error of law.

12.  However, it is clear from the bank statements provided,  which  I  have
    considered, that the Secretary of State's assessment, rehearsed in  the
    decision letter, was unassailably  correct.   The  FtT  was,  and  this
    Tribunal is, entitled to consider the bank statements  as  they  formed
    part of the materials considered by the Secretary of  State's  decision
    at the time when the impugned decision was made: see Nasim  and  Others
    [2013] UKUT 610 (IAC).  While the Judge's invocation of the prohibition
    enshrined in section 85A(3)(a) of the 2002 Act may have been in  error,
    this  was  of  no  consequence,  for  the  reasons   appearing   above.
    Furthermore, given the above analysis, the other errors of law which  I
    have identified were immaterial. It follows inexorably that the refusal
    to adjourn the hearing was not unfair, since the Appellant could not on
    any showing have succeeded. See, in this context, the decision of  this
    Tribunal in MM Sudan [2014] UKUT 105 (IAC),  [15]  -  [17]  especially.
    This leads to the conclusion that  the  decision  of  the  FtT  is  not
    vitiated by any material error of law.

13.  I have considered, finally, whether the hearing of this  appeal  should
    be adjourned and relisted, given the Appellant's non-attendance and the
    absence of any legal representative  on  his  behalf.  This  engages  a
    different rule of procedure. Rule 38 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 provides:

         "If a party fails to attend  a  hearing,  the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         proceed with the hearing if the Upper Tribunal -


         (a)  Is satisfied that the party has been notified of  the  hearing
             or that reasonable steps have been taken to notify  the  party
             of the hearing; and

         (b)  considers that it is in the interests of  justice  to  proceed
with the hearing."

    As regards (a), the conventional "Notice of Hearing" indicates that, on
    11 June 2014, the Appellant was notified of this hearing.   The  Notice
    was sent to the address specified in the application for permission  to
    appeal.  As regards (b), the  cardinal  rule  of  fairness,  identified
    above, applies fully. My assessment, logically, replicates that set out
    in [12] above.  For the reasons  given  there,  I  consider  that  this
    appeal  was  doomed  to  fail.   The  Appellant's  attendance,  whether
    represented  or  otherwise,  could  not  have  made   any   difference.
    Accordingly,  I  conclude  that  an  adjournment  and   relisting   are
    inappropriate.

14. I would add the following.  If it should transpire - see  [3]  above  -
    that this appeal has been superseded by a fresh application on the part
    of the Appellant, whether actual or contemplated, or that the Appellant
    decided, for whatever reason, that he would not pursue the appeal,  the
    effect of this may well be that the process of the Upper  Tribunal  has
    been  misused.   Where   any   appeal   becomes   moot,   in   whatever
    circumstances, there is a  pressing  duty  on  the  litigant  or  legal
    representative concerned to communicate this immediately to  the  Upper
    Tribunal and all other parties. A failure to do so  without  reasonable
    excuse will be considered a misdemeanour of  some  moment  and  may  be
    regarded as a misuse of process.

    DECISION


15.  I dismiss the appeal and affirm the decision of the FtT.
