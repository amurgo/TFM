For the Appellant:     Mr A. Gilbert, of counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                                  DECISION

   1. The appellant has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  against  the
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Coaster who, by a  determination
      promulgated on 4 October 2016, dismissed his appeal against a decision
      of the respondent, made on 3 December 2015, to refuse his  application
      for leave to remain as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  Because  the  appellant
      submitted his application as long ago as 18 October  2013,  he  has  a
      right of appeal  against  this  decision  because  of  the  applicable
      transitional provisions. The initial  adverse  decision  made  by  the
      respondent was withdrawn after the respondent had agreed to reconsider
      her decision.
   2. The respondent gave three reasons for refusing this application:


        a.  It  was  not  accepted  that  the   appellant   had   genuinely
           established, taken over or become a  director  of  one  or  more
           businesses in the UK and continued to operate them;


        b. It was not accepted that the sum of at least �50,000 demanded by
           Table 4 of Appendix A of the  Immigration  Rules  was  genuinely
           available to the appellant;

        c. It was not accepted that the appellant did not  intend  to  take
           employment in the  United  Kingdom  other  than  of  the  nature
           permitted.


   3. The judge did not accept the first of those concerns was made out, and
      found as a fact that the appellant "has genuinely established or taken
      over and became a director of Lifestyle Express Limited".


   4. However, the judge dismissed the appeal because  she  did  not  accept
      that the appellant had established that the �50,000 required by  Table
      4 was in fact available to the  appellant.  It  is  not  difficult  to
      understand why the judge entertained concern about this aspect of  the
      appellant's case because there was  a  stark  and  wholly  unexplained
      contradiction between what he had said in his application form  as  to
      how this investment was received by his company into an  account  with
      National Westminster Bank and his oral evidence before  the  judge  to
      the effect that the relevant funds had in fact been  received  into  a
      different account, in his own name.

   5. The appellant said that there had been an investment into his business
      of more than �100,000. In respect of the application to be decided, he
      had said in his application form that there had been an investment  of
      �56,123, received from his brother, Mr Iqbal Atain, who  had  invested
      that sum in LifeStyle Express  Limited.  He  set  out  the  dates  and
      amounts of the instalment paid to accumulate this total,  saying  that
      the payments were received into a National Westminster Bank account.


   6. There were plainly real difficulties with what had been  said  in  the
      application form because, as the judge noted, there were  no  National
      Westminster  Bank  statements  showing  the  nine  payments  totalling
      �56,123.67 that the appellant claimed had been received on  the  dates
      specified.

   7. In his oral evidence at  the  hearing  the  appellant  said  something
      different, as the judge recorded at paragraph 48 of her decision:


           "At the hearing, in evidence in chief, the Appellant stated that
           the payments  into  his  personal;  RBS  account  number  ending
           xxxx398 came from his brother Mr Iqbal Arain, and were available
           for investment in the  business.  We  looked  at  the  RBS  bank
           statements. The entries are cited on the RBS bank statements  as
           being from "Queens News", his brother's business. The  appellant
           said that the payments were in instalments because  his  brother
           did not have the funds  to  provide  him  with  �50,000  in  one
           tranche."


   8. At  paragraph 47 of her determination the judge said this:


           "Having searched the documents provided to me, I  am  unable  to
           find any  clear  unequivocal  documentary  evidence  of  a  loan
           agreement between the appellant and Lifestyle  Express  Limited;
           nor a loan referred to in the company's accounts;  nor  evidence
           of bank transactions  or  bank  transfers  where  the  Appellant
           and/or Lifestyle Express can  be  seen  to  have  received  sums
           totalling at  least  �50,000.  There  were  no  bank  statements
           provided for Nat West bank showing the instalments  set  out  at
           table 3a1 of the application form."


      And, having reproduced the schedule  of  payments  into  the  National
      Westminster Bank account set out in the application form, as  for  the
      RBS account the judge said:


           "There are no receipts entered in the "paid in  "column  in  the
           RBS statements between the above mentioned dates,  corresponding
           to the above listed investment funds... There  was  no  evidence
           before me of the above mentioned funds being received."


      The judge then observed that there was no copy of  a  director's  loan
      agreement in the documents before her and that  it  was  not  for  the
      Tribunal "to try and cross reference  payments  and  receipts  between
      various bank statements to establish his claims are  correct  or  not.
      This led  her  to  conclude  that  the  appellant's  evidence  "lacked
      transparency and as a result his evidence lacked  credibility".  As  a
      consequence, she did not accept that  the  appellant  had  established
      that which was required and so dismissed his appeal. Having  done  so,
      she did not go on to consider the third reason giving for refusing the
      application, presumably because, in the light of her decision that the
      appeal failed on the basis of the second reason for  refusal,  it  was
      unnecessary to do so.


   9. In his oral submissions, Mr Tufan pointed to the evident  difficulties
      with the case being advanced by this appellant and submitted that  the
      decision to  dismiss  the  appeal  was  one  open  to  the  judge.  He
      emphasised that  the  appellant's  brother  did  not  attend  to  give
      evidence before the judge;  that  the  contradictory  account  of  the
      source of the  funds  goes  unexplained  and  that  the  undated  loan
      agreement  now  produced  by  the  appellant  was  not,  as  had  been
      suggested, between the provider of those finds  and  the  company  but
      between himself and the company. Certainly, each of those maters  call
      for an explanation and may well prove to be formidable  obstacles  for
      the appellant.   However, I am persuaded by the  submissions  advanced
      by Mr Gilbert that the judge arrived at her conclusions and determined
      the appeal on the basis of three significant errors:


        a. The judge was wrong to consider that there had not been receipts
           of at least �50,000 into the RBS account  because  the  receipts
           from Queens News, the company owned by the appellant's  brother,
           did indeed exceed �50,000. If she reached that conclusion simply
           on the basis that there were no such receipts matching precisely
           the date and amounts stated in the application  form,  then  she
           was wrong to do so, given the nature of the appellant's evidence
           before her;


        b. The judge was wrong to hold against the appellant the absence of
           a director's loan agreement without raising that matter with him
           so that he had an opportunity to address that in evidence;


        c. The judge was simply wrong also to say, at paragraph 58  of  her
           decision, that the appellant had resigned from  AS  Stores  Ltd,
           the company referred to in his evidence recorded earlier at para
           23 to establish that his business interests were expanding.

  10. Those three misapprehensions were at the core of the reasoning leading
      to the adverse credibility findings arrived at by the judge and  I  am
      unable to say that the outcome would necessarily have been the same if
      not for those errors.  It follows that the judge has made an error  of
      law material to the outcome of the appeal so that her decision  cannot
      stand.


Summary of decision:

        i) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a  material  error  of
           law error of law and the decision of the judge  to  dismiss  the
           appeal shall be set aside.

       ii) The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed to the  extent  that
           the  appeal  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
           determined afresh.
