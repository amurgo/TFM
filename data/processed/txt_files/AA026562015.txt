For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014. I continue that order.
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. The Appellant, a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of State of  3rd  February
    2015 to refuse his application for asylum.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Callow accepted the core of the Appellant's claim that he  is  gay  but
    concluded that the Appellant  would  be  able  to  live  discreetly  in
    Pakistan by choice and because of social pressure and  therefore  would
    be at no risk on return to his home area or elsewhere in  Pakistan  and
    dismissed the appeal.

 2. Following a grant of permission to appeal the appeal  came  before  the
    Upper Tribunal and, in a decision dated 17th November  2015,  an  Upper
    Tribunal panel comprised of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Storey  and  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Rintoul found errors in the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's
    decision and set it aside.

 3. In summary the panel found that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred  in
    that his finding of fact were not sufficiently reasoned and that, given
    that the judge found the Appellant credible, it is not clear why he did
    not accept his evidence that he has a fear of being killed and of being
    persecuted  in  Pakistan.  The  panel   considered   that   there   was
    insufficient evidence as to the relevant background country  conditions
    relating to risks to homosexuals in Pakistan and that there was  not  a
    full set of findings of fact relevant to the assessment  that  must  be
    made in line with the guidance given in HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31 and  Y
    and Z [2013] WLR (D) 427, [2013] EUECJ C-199/1.

 4. Having found that there was a material error of law the panel therefore
    set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  aside  and  adjourned  the
    consideration of the appeal for a hearing to be conducted in  light  of
    the following directions:
    "(a) This case will be set down for a  further  hearing  in  the  Upper
         Tribunal.  The Appellant will be required to  give  oral  evidence.
         It is open to him to call witnesses if he notifies the Tribunal  of
         his intention  to  do  so  in  accordance  with  standard  Tribunal
         directions to follow.
    (b)  The next  Tribunal  will  take  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
         findings of fact as a starting point but as no more than  that  and
         it will be open to the Respondent to seek to displace those through
         cross examination, including questions seeking an  explanation  for
         discrepancies in the Appellant's  evidence  as  identified  in  the
         reasons for refusal letter.  In light  of  the  procedure  as  just
         outlined, it will then be a matter for the next Tribunal to  decide
         whether to preserve and build on the First-tier Tribunal's findings
         of fact or to substitute findings of their own based on an  overall
         assessment of the further and earlier evidence."

    The Resumed Hearing

 5. As a starting point I set out the background facts which the First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  considered  had  been  established  as  summarised  at
    paragraph 5 of the panel's decision, which states as follows:
         "5.  Those 'facts'  were  in  summary  that  the  appellant  was  a
             homosexual whose home area was [M-].   He  had  found  himself
             attracted to other males at school but  did  not  act  on  his
             attraction to men of the same sex until he came to the  UK  in
             November 2010 as a student.  He did not reveal  his  sexuality
             to his local  community  in  the  UK,  only  to  two  friends.
             However in early 2012 when he contacted his parents to provide
             him with further funds, his father told him he  should  return
             to finalise an arranged marriage with a cousin.  The appellant
             then told his family he was gay and did not wish to marry  the
             cousin.  His  father  and  brother  became  very  abusive  and
             threatened to kill him.  By this time the appellant had  begun
             a gay relationship in the UK with  a  man  called  A.   In  an
             affidavit dated 3 May 2014 the appellant's father stated  that
             he had disowned the appellant by reason of his sexuality.  The
             appellant could not return to [M-] as his potential parents-in-
             law were well-connected politically.  The  appellant  conceded
             that he might be able to live  in  other  areas  if  he  lived
             discreetly, for example in Peshawar.  In finding  these  facts
             the judge noted that the appellant's evidence was supported by
             a friend, FM, who gave evidence."

 6. In advance of the hearing before me the Appellant submitted  a  further
    bundle of evidence.  The material elements of this bundle are an up-to-
    date witness statement from the Appellant dated 9th February 2016 and a
    supporting witness statement from a friend made on the same date.

 7. At the hearing before me Mr Walker confirmed that he intended to cross-
    examine the Appellant in relation to the  affidavit  from  his  father,
    this being a matter raised in the reasons for refusal  letter,  and  in
    relation to the question as to how he would conduct  himself  upon  his
    return to Pakistan.  Both parties agreed that the  background  evidence
    remained the same as that which  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge and set out at paragraph 2 of the panel's decision, which is that
    paragraph 2.2.2 of the Pakistan penal code criminalises  homosexuality.
    Mr Walker also  submitted  Home  Office  country  information  guidance
    entitled "Pakistan: Sexual orientation and gender identity" from  2014.
    Mr Walker accepted that, if the Appellant  establishes  his  claim,  he
    would be at risk on return in Pakistan.

 8. The Appellant gave  oral  evidence  and,  in  examination-in-chief,  he
    confirmed the contents of his witness statement.  He also said that  he
    received the affidavit from his father around the end of May  2012  and
    this was because he had informed his father that he was gay.   He  said
    that he believed that his father had sent the affidavit to him to prove
    that he had disowned him.  He said that there were a lot of fights back
    home, that he had been threatened and he had been  thrown  out  of  the
    family.  He also said that in his affidavit his father had deprived him
    of all of his rights including rights to family property and his  right
    to use the family name and he said that the affidavit  meant  that  the
    family did not want to keep its relationship with him.

 9. When asked what he would do if he were to be returned  to  Pakistan  he
    said he could not live there because all of  his  family  members  knew
    about him and if he went there they would find out where he was living.
     When asked why he could not live there without  telling  anyone  about
    his sexual orientation he said that he is a human being with  feelings,
    that he wanted to establish a relationship with someone  and  he  would
    prefer it to be someone who was like him and that he could not hide his
    sexuality from anyone.

10. When asked what would happen if he lived openly  in  Pakistan  he  said
    that it is an Islamic country, that there is no  legal  protection  for
    gay people and that if he informed anyone about himself they would lash
    him and hurt him. He said that he would not be in a position to find  a
    house because a landlord would not let him a property and that he would
    not be able to find a job because  people  would  find  out  about  his
    sexuality through himself and through his family.

11. In cross-examination the  Appellant  said  that  he  had  received  the
    affidavit from his father through the post.  He said that he was  first
    informed by his father on the  phone  that  he  had  disowned  him  and
    afterwards he received  the  affidavit  by  post.   He  said  that  the
    conversation with his father on  the  phone  was  before  he  made  the
    application in March 2012 and he  thinks  that  the  conversation  took
    place in around February or March 2012.  He said that he  received  the
    letter containing the affidavit by post after he made the  application.
    He no longer had the envelope in which it came.

12. He said that when family members came to know about him they threatened
    him by telephone and that there was a  dispute  going  on  between  his
    family and the family of the  girl  he  was  meant  to  marry  as  that
    marriage had been arranged during his childhood.  He said  he  received
    threatening phone calls from  his  family  during  that  time  and  was
    informed about the arguments.  He received phone calls from his  family
    and then from members of  the  girl's  family  as  well  including  her
    brothers.

13. He did not know whether it was his father or mother but  he  knew  that
    his family had told other family members about his  sexual  orientation
    because the marriage had been arranged and they had to inform them that
    he was gay.  He said that his friends in the UK know that  he  is  gay.
    He shares a house and he does not have much contact with  the  landlord
    of the house.  He said that he does not attend the  local  mosque.   He
    accepted that the population of Pakistan is around  120,000,000  people
    but he said that he could not live his life in hiding there.   He  said
    that he has certain feelings and wants more in his life.  He said  that
    he believed that wherever he would go some of his family members  would
    be there and they would know where he was.

14. He said that in Pakistan all of the population are Muslims and that  he
    would not get any protection.  If anyone did anything to him  he  could
    not be protected or saved.  He said that he currently lives in  the  UK
    in a Muslim community and he wants to get out of that community but  in
    any event in the UK he can be protected, he can live an open  life  and
    he can select his life partner.  He cannot move to another area at  the
    minute because of financial restrictions.  He is not working.  Some  of
    his friends who are working help him financially.

15. In re-examination the Appellant  said  that  he  arranged  his  current
    accommodation through his friend who knows the landlord.   He  believes
    that he would be known in Pakistan if he went to seek accommodation.

16. I asked the Appellant a number of questions by way of clarification and
    he said that he shares a room in a house in  the  UK,  that  two  other
    people live there and that they know about his sexual orientation.   In
    response to questions from Mr Walker the Appellant confirmed  that  the
    other people he shares a house with are from  Pakistan  and  that  they
    know about and accept his sexuality.

17. In submissions Mr Walker relied on the reasons for refusal letter dated
    3rd February 2015.  He relied on paragraph  43,  which  indicated  that
    there was contradictory evidence as to when the affidavit was received.
     The affidavit from the Appellant's father is dated May 2012 but  there
    is evidence that it was received before that.  He  submitted  that  the
    Appellant has lived in the UK discreetly  in  relation  to  his  sexual
    orientation because that is what he wants to do.  He submitted that the
    Appellant says that everyone would find out in Pakistan  and  he  could
    not live safely but  he  could  live  within  a  large  city  and  work
    discreetly as he has chosen to do in the UK and that would be a  matter
    for him. He submitted that the  Secretary  of  State  has  doubted  the
    Appellant's sexuality, believing that it was a vehicle  used  to  claim
    asylum when his further leave to remain application was  refused.   The
    Secretary of State maintains that none of the evidence  indicates  that
    the Appellant would be in danger in Pakistan.  Mr Walker submitted that
    the Appellant would be able to live in Pakistan the way he  lives  here
    and that would not give rise to fear of persecution.

18. Mr Khan submitted that  the  Secretary  of  State  has  not  shown  any
    contradictory evidence put forward by the Appellant in relation to when
    he obtained his father's affidavit.  He submitted that a  copy  of  the
    Appellant's father's passport is attached to  the  affidavit  and  this
    indicates that it was not fraudulently  obtained.   He  also  submitted
    that in a strict social and cultural environment such as Pakistan it is
    more likely that the Appellant's father would make an affidavit such as
    this disowning the Appellant in these circumstances. He submitted  that
    there is no conflict in the Appellant's evidence  in  relation  to  the
    timing of receipt of the affidavit from his father. He  submitted  that
    in his oral evidence the Appellant  said  that  he  received  telephone
    calls and threats from February or March of 2012 and there  is  nothing
    to support the assertion in paragraph 43 of  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    letter that the Appellant said that the affidavit was sent  to  him  in
    April 2012 and there is therefore no inconsistency.  In  any  event  he
    submitted that at paragraph 18 the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that
    the core of the Appellant's claim was credible.

19. Mr Khan submitted that the test in HJ (Iran) is not simply whether  the
    Appellant would live discreetly but it is necessary to go on to ask why
    he would live  discreetly.   He  submitted  that  the  Appellant  lives
    discreetly in the UK but friends and people he lives with are aware  of
    his sexuality and that the Appellant benefits from equal rights in  the
    UK.  He submitted that the Appellant's oral evidence  was  that  if  he
    returns to Pakistan he wants to have relationships, that he cannot hide
    and that he wants to live openly. He  submitted  the  Appellant's  oral
    evidence that he could not live freely because of  the  strict  Islamic
    laws and there was no law to protect him and that he believes  that  he
    would have difficulties and would be  prosecuted  or  persecuted.   The
    Appellant may hide initially but when  he  forms  relationships  people
    would come to know.  If he sought accommodation a landlord would  know.
    If he applied for a job it is likely that  those  employing  him  would
    know and if he was subject to discrimination there would be no  law  to
    protect him.  He therefore submitted that the second limb of  the  test
    in HJ (Iran) is met.

20. Mr Khan referred to the panel's directions and submitted that there was
    nothing in cross-examination  to  contradict  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's finding that the Appellant is gay.  He submitted that,  looking
    at the situation in the round, the Appellant's account is credible, the
    core of his story still stands and that if he is returned he would  not
    live discreetly, he wants to live openly and HJ (Iran) applies.

    Findings

21. I have considered all of the oral and documentary evidence  before  me.
    In relation to the directions made by the panel I note  that  Direction
    (b) indicated that  I  should  take  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    findings of fact as a starting point and that it would be open  to  the
    Respondent to seek to displace those through cross-examination.   I  am
    satisfied that cross-examination did not displace the finding  made  by
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge that the core details of the  Appellant's
    claim are credible.

22. Mr Walker cross-examined the Appellant  in  relation  to  his  father's
    affidavit.  I find that there is no contradiction  in  the  Appellant's
    evidence in relation to when and how he received that affidavit  and  I
    also take account of the fact that the affidavit was accompanied  by  a
    copy of the Appellant's father's passport.  I therefore do  not  accept
    that there is  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  the  affidavit  is
    fraudulent and I take it into account in the round along with the other
    evidence.

23. I am satisfied on the basis of all of the evidence that  the  Appellant
    has established that he is gay as claimed and that he has been disowned
    by his family. He has been consistent in his account and I  accept  the
    Appellant's evidence that his family  and  the  family  of  his  former
    fianc�e are aware of his sexual orientation  and  I  accept  that  this
    would mean that people in his home area would know about his sexuality.
    I accept that  he  has  been  disowned  by  his  family  and  has  been
    threatened by his father  and  by  his  former  fianc�e's  family.  The
    Appellant would therefore be unable to  live  discreetly  in  his  home
    area.

24. In light of the finding that the Appellant  is  gay  the  issue  to  be
    determined is whether the Appellant would live discreetly  upon  return
    to Pakistan and, if so, why he would do so.

25. It is clear from his evidence that the Appellant lives discreetly to  a
    certain extent in the UK.  However, those with whom he  lives  and  his
    friends know that he is gay. Whilst he lives fairly discreetly  in  the
    UK he has been involved in a relationship here and he also was clear in
    his evidence that he wishes to develop relationships in the future  and
    that he values the legal protection he enjoys in the UK.

26. I take account of the  Appellant's  oral  evidence  that  it  would  be
    difficult for him to live  discreetly  elsewhere  in  Pakistan  in  the
    longer term.  I accept that if he were to find accommodation and a  job
    and develop relationships that he believes that it is likely  that  his
    sexual orientation would become apparent.

27. In any event I take account of the Appellant's evidence that if he were
    to live discreetly in Pakistan, even in the short term, the reason  for
    him doing  so  would  be  because  of  a  fear  of  discrimination  and
    persecution whereas the reason for him living  somewhat  discreetly  in
    the UK is more about social  and  cultural  pressures.   Whilst  it  is
    apparent that social pressures would be relevant to how he  would  live
    upon return to Pakistan I accept on the basis of his oral evidence that
    a material reason for his living discreetly on return would be  a  fear
    of persecution which would follow if he were to live openly  as  a  gay
    man.

28. I have considered the guidance in HJ (Iran). Lord Hope set out the test
    as follows:
         "35. This brings me to the test that should be adopted by the fact-
         finding tribunals in this country. As Lord  Walker  points  out  in
         para 98, this involves what is essentially an individual and  fact-
         specific inquiry. Lord Rodger has described the  approach  in  para
         82, but I would like to set it out in my own words. It is necessary
         to proceed in stages.
             (a)  The first stage, of course, is to  consider  whether  the
             applicant is indeed gay. Unless he can establish that he is of
             that orientation he will not be entitled to be  treated  as  a
             member of the particular social group. But I would regard this
             part of the test as having been satisfied if  the  applicant's
             case is that he is  at  risk  of  persecution  because  he  is
             suspected of being gay, if his past history shows that this is
             in fact the case.
             (b)  The next stage is to examine a group of  questions  which
             are directed to what his situation will  be  on  return.  This
             part of the inquiry is directed to what  will  happen  in  the
             future. The  Home  Office's  Country  of  Origin  report  will
             provide the background. There will  be  little  difficulty  in
             holding that in countries such as Iran and  Cameroon  gays  or
             persons who are believed to be gay  are  persecuted  and  that
             persecution is something that may reasonably  be  feared.  The
             question is how each applicant, looked at  individually,  will
             conduct himself if returned and how others will react to  what
             he does. Those others will include everyone with whom he  will
             come in contact, in private as well as in public. The  way  he
             conducts himself may vary from one situation to another,  with
             varying degrees of  risk.  But  he  cannot  and  must  not  be
             expected to conceal aspects of his sexual orientation which he
             is unwilling to conceal, even from those  whom  he  knows  may
             disapprove of it. If he fears persecution as a result and that
             fear is well-founded, he will be entitled  to  asylum  however
             unreasonable his refusal to resort to concealment may be.  The
             question what is reasonably tolerable  has  no  part  in  this
             inquiry.
             (c)  On the other hand, the fact that the applicant  will  not
             be able to do in the country  of  his  nationality  everything
             that he can do openly in the country whose protection he seeks
             is not the  test.  As  I  said  earlier  (see  para  15),  the
             Convention was not directed to reforming the level  of  rights
             in the country of origin. So it would be wrong to approach the
             issue on the basis that the purpose of the  Convention  is  to
             guarantee to an applicant who is  gay  that  he  can  live  as
             freely and as openly as a gay person as he would be able to do
             if he were not returned. It does not guarantee to everyone the
             human rights standards  that  are  applied  by  the  receiving
             country within its own territory. The focus throughout must be
             on what will happen in the country of origin.
             (d)  The next stage, if it is found that the applicant will in
             fact conceal aspects of his sexual orientation if returned, is
             to consider why he will do so.  If  this  will  simply  be  in
             response to social pressures  or  for  cultural  or  religious
             reasons of his own choosing and  not  because  of  a  fear  of
             persecution, his claim for asylum must be rejected. But if the
             reason why he will resort to concealment is that he  genuinely
             fears that  otherwise  he  will  be  persecuted,  it  will  be
             necessary to consider whether that fear is well founded.
             (e)  This is the final and conclusive question: does he have a
             well-founded fear that he will be persecuted? If he  has,  the
             causative condition that Lord Bingham referred to in Januzi  v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006]  2  AC  426,
             para 5 will have  been  established.  The  applicant  will  be
             entitled to asylum.
         36.  It should always  be  remembered  that  the  purpose  of  this
         exercise is to separate out those who are  entitled  to  protection
         because their fear of persecution is well founded  from  those  who
         are not. The causative condition is central to  the  inquiry.  This
         makes it necessary to concentrate on what  is  actually  likely  to
         happen to the applicant. As  Lord  Walker  says  in  para  88,  the
         inquiry is directed to what  will  happen  in  the  future  if  the
         applicant is  returned  to  his  own  country.  An  approach  which
         disregards what is in fact likely to occur there in the case of the
         particular applicant is wrong and should not be adopted."

29. I take into account the fact that it was accepted that if the Appellant
    were  to  return  to  Pakistan  the  penal  code  at  paragraph   2.2.2
    criminalises homosexuality and I note from the country information  and
    guidance submitted by Mr Walker that in Pakistan there is no  effective
    protection from the state for those from the LGBT  community.   I  note
    that the background evidence demonstrates that a person in the position
    of the Appellant is likely to be in fear of persecution in Pakistan.

30. I accept on the basis of the Appellant's evidence as set out above that
    if he was returned to Pakistan he would be at risk of  persecution  and
    physical harm in his home area. I accept that if he relocated away from
    his home area he may live discreetly in the  short  term  but  that  he
    would be unable to conceal his sexuality in the longer term.  I  accept
    his evidence that if he were to live discreetly it would be because  of
    the fear of physical harm and persecution. The evidence before me shows
    that such fear is well-founded. In these circumstances the Appellant is
    entitled to protection.

31.  I  therefore  remake  the  decision  in  this  case  by  allowing  the
    Appellant's appeal.
