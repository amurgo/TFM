                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Spencer Counsel instructed by Huneewoth
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. It is alleged that the First-tier Tribunal  made  a  procedural  error
      amounting to an error of law because it proceeded with the hearing  in
      the absence of the appellant on 20 August 2019, not realising that  he
      could not attend because he was in custody and had not been brought.

   2. At the hearing before me there were  several  matters  that  supported
      that claim but no evidence directly on the point. I  decided  that  it
      was of such importance that the appellant should be given a chance  to
      remedy the deficiency and I gave directions.

   3. In compliance with those directions the appellant's solicitors sent  a
      "Release Date  Notification  Slip"  showing  that  the  appellant  was
      expected to be released on 23 August 2019 and Mr  Kotas  sent  a  note
      confirming that the respondent's records showed that the appellant was
      in custody on 20 August 2019.

   4. I thank both parties for complying with directions.

   5. The appellant clearly was in custody. There clearly was  a  procedural
      error amounting to an error of law.

   6. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and I direct  that
      the appeal be heard again in the First-tier Tribunal.
