Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellants and to the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of the  United  States  of  America.   WK's
    date of birth is [ ]  1976.   She  is  the  mother  of  the  two  child
    appellants, AW and ZW.   AW's date of birth is [ ] 2009. ZW's  date  of
    birth is [ ] 2012. They were at the date of the hearing aged 8  and  5.
    Both children were born in the US.  They travelled  to  the  UK  on  11
    August 2014 having  been  granted  visit  visas  which  expired  on  11
    February 2015.  Prior to the expiry of their visit visas they  made  an
    application  to  remain  on  family  and  private  life  grounds.   The
    applications  were  refused.   They  appealed  and  their  appeal   was
    dismissed on 1 April 2015 by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Ghaffar
    in a decision promulgated on  5  August  2016.   Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Plimmer granted permission on 9 March.

2.   The matter came before me on 8 May 2017. I decided  that  the  FtT  had
    materially erred and set aside the decision. The judge  concluded  that
    there was family life between the appellants and their  relatives  here
    in the UK (WK's sister (AK) and her husband (FA) and  their  children).
    They were dependent on the family and they  all  lived  together  here.
    The judge however, went on to conclude that there was  no  interference
    with family life should they be  removed  to  the  US.   However,  this
    conclusion was inadequately reasoned considering  the  relationship  as
    found by the judge between the  child  appellants  and  their  extended
    family.  The matter came before me on 4 December 2017 for a re-hearing.



3.   I heard evidence from WK, SA and AK.

WK's Evidence

4.       WK gave oral evidence adopting her statement of  evidence  dated  6
    June 2016 as evidence-in-chief. She was born in Pakistan. She married a
    US citizen on 7 January 2004 in an arranged marriage.  She travelled to
    the US on a fianc�e visa in December 2004. Her husband was abusive  and
    violent to her.  His family verbally and mentally abused  her  treating
    her like a slave from Pakistan.

5.       Her sister (AK) in the UK was the only support she had. In 2005  AK
    sponsored her to travel to the UK on a visit visa.   She  spent  almost
    three months here.  Her husband would not let her return to the US. She
    returned without his knowledge and stayed with her sister's friend  who
    took pity on her and allowed her to stay with her  for  a  month.   She
    then contacted various women's agencies and told them that she was  the
    victim of domestic violence and that she had nowhere to live.  New York
    Asian Women Shelter arranged for English classes and provided temporary
    accommodation where she felt safe for approximately six months.

6.   WK got a green card in 2007 (on the basis that  she  was  a  victim  of
    domestic violence).  She applied for a divorce in the US.  However, her
    ex-husband and his family were very angry with her  and  he  would  not
    cooperate with the  divorce  in  the  US,  having  divorced  her  under
    Pakistani law. Her family wanted her to re-marry and  she  returned  to
    Pakistan in order to do so.  She returned to  the  US  in  2008  having
    remarried in Pakistan, but there were problems regarding the lawfulness
    of the divorce under US law.  Her husband could not get a visa to enter
    the US and remained in Pakistan.

7.   Her husband was diagnosed with aplastic  anaemia.   He  needed  a  bone
    marrow transplant.     WK  became  an  American  citizen  in  2011.   A
    further application  for  her  husband  to  join  her  in  the  US  was
    unsuccessful because the authorities there were not satisfied that  she
    was divorced. WK remained in the US (her husband remained in  Pakistan)
    in temporary accommodation, between 2006 and 2013.

8.   Her ex-husband's family continued to abuse her. AW  was  born  in  2009
    and WK came to visit her for four weeks to help her.   When  AW  was  6
    months old she started attending the New York  City  Benefit  Programme
    for job searchers and she put him into day care because  there  was  no
    one else to take care of him.  He was healthy up until this point.   He
    stopped gaining weight.  Life was very difficult and stressful at  this
    time because she had no family and was intimidated by  her  ex-husband.
    Her husband was critically ill in Pakistan.  She was depressed and  she
    could not cope.

9.       ZW was born in 2012 and her sister came to help her again. At  that
    time the AW had fractured her foot and was unable to walk.  It  was  at
    this stage she realised it would  be  totally  impossible  for  her  to
    manage.  She could not stay in the US  because  of  the  difficulty  of
    looking after her children without any family support.  She returned to
    Pakistan to live with her husband in September 2013.  However, he  died
    following chemotherapy on  22  November  2013  in  the  Islamabad  Army
    Hospital.

10.  Her husband died as a result of negligent treatment, on which they  had
    spent a lot of money. If he had been treated in the US  he  would  have
    survived.  After his death her in-laws behaviour  towards  her  changed
    following inheritance issues and they took a lot of property  belonging
    to WK and her husband. After the funeral they kicked her out  of  their
    home.

11.  WK went to  live  with  her  married  brother  who  is  unemployed  and
    mentally unwell.  He lives with their widowed mother.   She  is  partly
    blind and lives on a small income from her father.   She  stayed  there
    for a  year.   During  this  time  she  stayed  indoors  and  was  very
    depressed.  She was unable to access any of her belongings  which  were
    at her in-laws' house. Her in-laws continued to threaten  her  and  ask
    for money and life insurance documents that her husband left for  their
    children.  Her husband's brother filed a petition in Azad Kashmir Court
    and produced a statement which had been purportedly made by her husband
    indicating that his property should go to him rather  than  to  WK  and
    children. It became impossible for her  to  live  in  Pakistan  with  a
    continuous threat from her in-laws and she was  unable  to  obtain  her
    husband's assets.  She came to the UK to visit her brother and her  two
    sisters here with a view to return to the US.

12.   When he was  aged  2  years  and  11  months  AW  was  diagnosed  with
    developmental delays and autism. He has motor skills problems as  well.
    He received speech therapy in the US.  He attended a special school and
    two ladies attended the home to give therapy. He needs extra  attention
    that the WK cannot give him. He is very disturbed by the death  of  his
    father.   In her view removal would have a profound effect on him.   He
    behaves like a 2 year old.  He cries about little things.  He wants  to
    remain here and live as a family with his aunt and uncle  and  cousins.
    She decided to go back to the US after three weeks of being here but he
    cried and stated that he wanted to  stay  living  with  his  aunts  and
    cousins.  They are now settled  here.   The  children  attend  ordinary
    school here. Whenever she is not well and depressed  the  children  are
    looked after by their aunt.    The children are very happy here.   They
    were always getting ill in Pakistan and yet here they remain  well.  AW
    is now eating properly.   He needs to be with his family here.

13.  WK does not have a house or a job to enable her to raise  her  children
    in US.  They are provided for by her family here.  She accepts that the
    state will support her in the US but because of the  difficulties  that
    she faces she would require emotional and moral support from her family
    which would not be available to her there.   She suffers from  anxiety,
    depression and has panic attacks.  She  finds  it  difficult  to  erase
    things from her mind about what has  happened  to  her  over  the  last
    twelve years.  She has been on medication since 2004.  She is currently
    taking citalopram for  depression  and  co-codamol  for  pain  to  help
    alleviate pain from  headaches.   She  pays  for  medication  here  but
    receives medical assistance on the NHS.  She is  worried  that  if  she
    returns to US she will have to look for a job and there will be no  one
    to take care of her children.  Her oral evidence  was  that  she  still
    fears the family of her first husband in the US.  Her brother-in-law is
    a police officer.

14.  Prior to her first marriage the WK worked as a  teacher.  She  resigned
    because her ex-husband and his family did not want her to work.

FA's Evidence

15.  FA (WK's brother-  in-  law  and  uncle  to  the  children)  gave  oral
    evidence adopting his witness statements of 14 December  2014,  18  May
    2016 and 21 June 2017 (which is a joint statement signed by both FA and
    his wife (AK)) as evidence-in-chief.

16.      The appellants live with FA, his wife and their two children.  They
    live together as a family and he and  his  wife  help  parent  all  the
    children.  WK is very depressed about  her  life.  Her  first  marriage
    breakdown as a  result  of  domestic  abuse  and  then  there  was  the
    traumatic death of her second  husband  as  a  result  of  bone  marrow
    failure.  She suffers from depression and has panic attacks.   She  has
    not been able to properly grieve because she has had the constant  need
    to be a mother to her children. This has had a damaging impact  on  her
    personality and character.

17.  The pressure of having to raise two young children  one  of  which  has
    severe behavioural problems makes it impossible for her to take care of
    her children alone.  She is unable to deal with the  responsibility  of
    being a single mother.  She views it as an impossible burden and FA and
    his wife provide day to day support for her.

18.      WK is very fearful of going back to the  US  and  being  alone  and
    this is the main reason for her poor mental condition  and  depression.
    FA and his wife are there all the time  to  support  her  and  the  two
    children. They provide accommodation, food, clothes and their  expenses
    generally including the cost of their immigration matters.   Should she
    return to the US WK is in real danger of falling  into  a  more  severe
    depression.  Her first husband and his family are there and they harass
    her from time to time through family friends.

19.   The children are very close to FA and his wife.  They consider him  to
    be their father.  FA stated in evidence that every couple of  weeks  he
    and his wife and their two children visit his parents in Leicester.  AW
    becomes very tearful and upset and does not  eat  properly  until  they
    return.  He will contact him and his wife on the phone.  Both  children
    have called him 'dad' on a few occasions.  He tries to discourage  this
    because he does not want them to become over reliant on him because  of
    the uncertainty of their status here.  FA is acutely aware that  if  he
    has to leave it will be particularly difficult for him.   AW  tries  to
    impress him, as he would a father, and wants to spend  time  with  him.
    In his view AW would become very depressed  if  he  has  to  leave  the
    family unit.  He cries a lot and has tantrums and appears like  someone
    who cannot cope.  He looks on AK as an older mother and he also  relies
    on his cousins with whom he plays and  eats.   FA's  view  is  that  WK
    cannot give AW what he needs because of her own issues.  In his view WK
    would not be able to cope in the US on her own.   When  she  was  there
    previously she found it very hard to look after the  children  and  his
    wife had to travel there on two occasions in order to assist her

20.  FA works full-time but on a Friday he works from home in  order  to  do
    the school run.  During the week  the  family  eat  together.   At  the
    weekend he normally makes breakfast, talks to the children, takes  them
    to the library, plays games with them and takes the boys  shopping.  He
    stated that the boys as distinct from the girls needed to go out of the
    house and he takes them out at the weekend.  He is the only male in the
    house and he is considered the only male  role  model  as  far  as  the
    children are concerned.

21.   FA earns �135,000 gross per annum and whilst he  can  accommodate  and
    look after the needs of WK and the children at present within their own
    home, it would be difficult for him to continue to do  this  should  he
    have to pay for accommodation and other needs whilst  in  the  US.   WK
    would find it very difficult to have to find a job and  to  cope.   She
    has a first degree in Pakistan but in FA's views this has no  value  in
    New York.  He has some knowledge of the job market in New  York  having
    employed people there.  She has not registered her degree  at  a  local
    college.  She was looking for employment at the time  she  was  in  New
    York but it would be a challenge for her.  She would only  be  able  to
    get lower skilled jobs as a house cleaner or something of that  nature.



AK's Evidence

22.  AK gave oral evidence adopting her witness statement of  21  June  2017
    (a joint statement with her husband, FA) as  evidence  in  chief.   Her
    evidence mirrors that of her husband. AW becomes  "mentally  disturbed"
    when she and her husband and their children go away at the weekends  to
    Leicester to visit her in-laws.

Medical Evidence

23.      The appellants rely on a psychiatric report from Dr S N Mohamed,  a
    Consultant Psychiatrist of 8 June 2017 and two  addendums  of  21  July
    2017 and 31 October 2017.  The report of 12 June 2017 indicates that Dr
    Mohamed made a record of WK's background information and  personal  and
    family history documenting domestic violence from her first husband and
    her second marriage and the death of her husband  and  mistreatment  by
    her in-laws.

24.      It is  recorded  that  WK  started  developing  panic  attacks  and
    depression  during  her  first  marriage.  Her   condition   has   been
    deteriorating over the last few years. She sought medical help  in  the
    US, Pakistan and in the UK.  A clinical assessment was carried  out  by
    Dr Mohamed. He concludes that that the  WK   has  been  suffering  from
    symptoms of depression and anxiety including  disturbed  sleep,  varied
    appetite, lack of concentration and affected memory,  irritability  and
    anhedonia, low self esteem and worrying.  She  has  had  regular  panic
    attacks and feels "trapped and incapable" at times.

25.  In Dr Mohamed's opinion WK is suffering  from  depression  (F32.1)  and
    panic disorder (episodic paroxysmal anxiety) (F41.0), as classified  by
    the International Statistical Classification of  Diseases  and  Related
    Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10).  Dr Mohamed indicated that  it
    would be difficult to offer a precise prognosis  at  this  stage,  that
    psychological symptoms started during  WK's  first  marriage  and  have
    deteriorated since then following  perceived  negative  events  in  her
    life.  She seems to have extensive support and care from family members
    here and feels able to raise her children with the care and support she
    needs.  The uncertainty of her status is exacerbating her psychological
    symptoms.  She would benefit from the  prescription of  antidepressants
    such as citalopram as well as well as  propranolol  to  deal  with  her
    anxiety and medication to help with sleep disturbance.  She should also
    be  considered  for  a  course  of  culturally  appropriate   cognitive
    behavioural therapy.

26.  Dr Mohamed records that AW started to have developmental issues  during
    infant years and concerns were raised by his mother when  she  realised
    he would not put on weight as normal.  He started walking  aged  1  but
    did not fully communicate through talking until he  was  over  3  years
    old.  Medical records indicate that he was having developmental  issues
    and he was offered and underwent speech therapy at the age  of  2.   He
    was assessed to have "variable attention span in concentration levels".
     He displayed "low levels of frustration tolerance and was observed  to
    give up almost immediately when challenged".  He was reported to "anger
    easily" and have "difficulty sitting still" and to  be  "distractible".
    AW was reported to have become close to his father after  he  moved  to
    Pakistan to be with him during the last few months of his life  and  he
    remembers his father as being a kind man.  After  his  death  he  lived
    with his mother, her brother, his maternal uncle and grandmother.   His
    mother would spend most of her time with the children  indoors  and  he
    remembers this time as "very bad" and that he did not "like it  there".
    AW has a better memory of coming to the UK and living with his aunt and
    uncle.  He enjoys school and playing with his friends and  cousins  and
    he has on more than one occasion referred to his aunt's husband as  his
    own "father".

27.    Much the of the above information came from  information  taken  from
    WK and from a document which is  attached  to  the  psychiatric  report
    which is an Individualised Education Programme (IEP)  relating  to  AW.
    Dr Mohamed has made reference to this.  This document indicates that AW
    has been classified as autistic and that he is functioning  within  the
    mildly impaired range of cognitive ability with both  verbal  and  non-
    verbal skills falling within the borderline range.  He has  significant
    delays in his expressive, receptive and pragmatic language skills.   He
    is  reported  to  be  impulsive  with  high  distractibility;  he   has
    difficulty sitting still and refused to follow directions.  He exhibits
    hand flapping behaviours and is easily upset,  angered  and  frustrated
    and tantrums frequently.  Whilst  his  social  skills  are  delayed  he
    demonstrates adequate motor and daily living skills.  He has difficulty
    participating in interactive play involving initiating, turn taking and
    sharing.  The document reports on  a  variety  of  recommended  special
    education programmes and services.  I am not sure of the  date  of  the
    assessment but must predate the 2013 when they left the US. .
.
28.   Dr  Mohamed  examined   AW.   From   this   he   reached   conclusions
    independently. He found interaction with him was difficult as a  result
    of his "varied concentration and irritability".   He  is  smaller  than
    average, lacks focus and becomes irritated quickly.  He seemed to  have
    a good relationship with both his mother and aunt but  they  found  his
    behaviour challenging most times.  He clung to his mother most  of  the
    time and reverted back to her in sight of any difficulty.  He  demanded
    attention and took up a lot of his mother's  and  his  aunt's  time  to
    control him.  He seemed to have had some developmental issues including
    delayed speech and he has been assessed  to  be  suffering  from  motor
    skills problems.  He lacked  normal  attention  and  concentration  and
    became irritable quickly and demanded a great deal  of  attention.   It
    appeared that he is developing some behavioural  problems  which  could
    well have emanated from  his  adverse  past  experience  of  living  in
    Pakistan and the loss of his father as well as a general lack of family
    cohesion.  Dr Mohamed  is  of  the  opinion  that  "he  could  well  be
    suffering from some form  of  attention  deficiency  and  hyperactivity
    which needs to be explored further".  He concluded:

         "74. "He seems to be adjusting well to his new life in the  UK  and
             enjoys the family life.  He receives help and support from the
             family here which would  not  be  directly  available  to  him
             living with his parent either in Pakistan or in the US.

         7.5. Furthermore his sole parent and carer, his mother is certainly
             enjoying the family cohesion and support and a better  quality
             of life here living among and close to her family  in  such  a
             convivial environment.  It  is  in  my  opinion  important  to
             reiterate that [AW's] mother's mental health and peace of mind
             will be intrinsically connected to [AW's] wellbeing and future
             mental health.  The recommendation in the report is that  [AW]
             should  be  fully  assessed  by   a   child   and   adolescent
             psychologist."


29.  The  addendum  of  21  July  2017  is  concerned  with  the  effect  of
    separation in relation to the  children  from  their  aunt,  uncle  and
    cousins.  Dr Mohamed states as follows:

         "It was quite obvious during the assessment  that  he  [AW]  has  a
         close relationship with his aunt and listens to her  when  directed
         by her.  I was told that he maintains a good relationship with  his
         cousins although older but he regards  them  as  part  of  his  own
         family, seeing  them  every  day  and  spending  time  together  as
         'siblings'."

     The report goes on to state:

         "... [AW] seems to have  developed  a  close  relationship  to  his
         aunt's  husband  (usually  called  uncle).   His  uncle  has   been
         receptive and supporting filling a much needed  father  figure  for
         [AW].  I was told that [AW] regards him as a 'father' and  on  more
         than one occasion has actually called him 'father'."

30.  Dr Mohamed states that WK  is  heavily  dependent  on  her  sister  for
    support and care and regards the help and support as  the  only  reason
    she is able to continue.  There is a more recent addendum of 31 October
    2017 where the doctor considered the  effect  of  long-term  separation
    from the children's only male role  model  and  the  doctor  states  as
    follows:

        "I am of the opinion that [WK] and her children [AW] and [ZW]  have
        become 'integrated' into her sister's lives  to  such  degree  that
        they regard them as members of their own family.  Their  separation
        could  implicate  serious  psychological  problems  for  all  three
        individuals to the extent of  affecting  much  deteriorated  mental
        health issues including depression and anxiety for [WK] and further
        behavioural and psychological complications for [AW].

         Presently [AW] is going  through  formative  stages  of  his  life.
         These  years  are  regarded  psychologically  important   and   are
         considered the formation of many foundations  of  the  individual's
         future mental health.  [AW] clearly understands that  he  does  not
         have a 'father' and considering  the  greater  importance  of  this
         issue within the  culture  and  tradition  he  is  brought  up,  he
         subconsciously  and  quite  automatically  has   formed   a   close
         relationship with his 'uncle' considering him as a 'father' and  by
         extension the cousins as 'siblings'.  It should be noted  that  the
         already close relationship between  [AW]  and  his  aunt,  whom  he
         regards as a second 'mother'  has  helped  to  reinforce  the  said
         relationship between [AW] and his uncle.

         I am therefore of the  opinion  that  [AW's]  separation  from  his
         adopted family, and particularly his only father figure, will  have
         direct psychological consequences; leaving him  with  a  void  that
         could result in  serious  psychological  problems  both  in  short,
         medium and long term.  The most prominent effect will be on  [AW's]
         behaviour which will deteriorate as a result  of  such  separation.
         Consequently there is  a  strong  possibility  that  [AW's]  mental
         health will be affected in later years.

         As outlined above [WK] has also developed strong psychological  and
         emotional attachment to her sister and her family.  She has  had  a
         very difficult life managing it all on her own over  the  last  few
         years.  She found respite in her hectic and chaotic life  with  her
         sister and  her  family  in  the  UK.   She  has  become  gradually
         dependent on the care and support she receives from her sister  and
         her husband as well as the nieces.  I am of  the  opinion  that  if
         [WK] is forced to leave the safety and care of this  newfound  life
         her mental health will be affected and seriously deteriorated.  She
         will then have difficulty to look after herself  and  her  children
         effectively which in turn will have a  direct  effect  on  her  two
         sons' wellbeing."


31.  The appellants relied on a letter from Plumbridge Medical Centre of  28
    June 2017 from Dr Hashim which indicates that they  are  registered  as
    NHS patients and have been in the practice since September 2015.  WK is
    suffering from stress, anxiety and  depression  due  to  an  "unsettled
    life".  She lived alone in the  US  with  her  children  and  this  has
    impacted on her mentally.  The GP states that she is under  observation
    of a psychiatrist in the UK.  Her children are well-settled  in  school
    here with their family.  The concluding paragraph reads as follows:

         "She really needs company and will not be  able  to  cope  mentally
         alone and children will be vulnerable of being neglected."

32.      Dr Sharpe,  Consultant  Community  Paediatrician  from  Oxleas  NHS
    Foundation Trust,   reviewed  AW  following  a  referral  from  his  GP
    regarding abnormal  behaviour,  hyperactivity,  sweating,  bad  temper,
    crying without reason and delay at school. He was under the  review  of
    the community paediatric team  but  was  discharged  in  February  2017
    following a review by Dr Choudhury on mutual agreement due to  improved
    symptoms.  He was referred back to the community paediatric team in May
    2017.   The  appellants  rely  on  a  letter  from  Dr  Sharpe  to  the
    appellant's  GP  18  September  2017.   Dr  Sharpe  concludes  that  AW
    presented social communication and interaction difficulties.  She noted
    concerns regarding his  level  of  learning  which  has  not  yet  been
    formally assessed within the school setting.  A care  plan  was  agreed
    with the WK.  The  school  has  recommended  obtaining  an  educational
    psychology assessment and other matters culminating in the need  for  a
    review in six months' time.    The  problems  that  she  highlights  in
    respect of AW are as follows:

         . social communication and interaction difficulties;

         . inattentiveness;

         . concerns of learning difficulties;

         . joint mobility and flat feet;

         . improved gross motor skills, and

         . A diagnosis of autism in US in 2013.

Submissions

33.  The appellants rely on the case of R  (on  the  application  of)  RK  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (Section 117B (6); "parental
    relationship") IJR [2016] UKUT 31.  The respondent relies on  the  case
    of Rajendran (Section 117B - family life) [2016] UKUT 00138.

34.    Mr Bramble made submissions relying on the decision of the  Secretary
    of State on 1 April 2015. The starting point is  that  the  aAppellants
    cannot meet the requirements of the Rules and he  referred  me  to  the
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal at paragraphs 27 to 30.  There  are
    no very significant obstacles in the context of  paragraph  276ADE  (1)
    (VI).  Mr Bramble referred me  to  the  WK's  witness  statement  which
    indicated that she had worked in the US  and  has  benefited  from  the
    welfare system there.  It is not arguable that she is at risk from  her
    ex-husband's family. She left America in  2013.   The  appellants  came
    here as visitors. Mr Bramble submitted that it was not in dispute  that
    there was family life which potentially engages Article 8 of  the  1950
    Convention.

35.   The  medical  evidence  does  not  assist  the  appellants.    It   is
    speculative.  FA does not have qualifications in child psychology.  The
    children could return to the US and continue their  lives  there.   The
    eldest child  has  lived  longer  in  the  US  than  in  the  UK.   The
    appellants' status  is  precarious.   WK  has  received  NHS  treatment
    without paying for. It cannot  be  said  that  the  appellants  do  not
    present a financial burden on the state.

36.  Mr Murphy submitted that matters  have  moved  on  since  the  original
    decision of the Secretary of State three and  a  half  years  ago.  The
    evidence establishes that WK could not cope  on  her  own  in  the  US.
    Whether or not the fear from her ex-husband's family is  subjective  or
    objective, it is a relevant consideration to take into account.  Should
    she be returned AW's behaviour will deteriorate.  AW looks on his uncle
    as his father and the only male role model that he  has.   There  is  a
    parental relationship.  Removal would be to the detriment  of  the  two
    children who are blameless as far as the precariousness of  their  stay
    here or their immigration history generally is concerned.  The decision
    would remove the children from  a  stable  family  and  this  would  be
    disproportionate.

Conclusions

The Best Interests of the Children

 37. The Supreme Court in Zoumbas v SSHD [2013]  UKSC  74  formulated  seven
    principles which are as follows:

    (1)  The best interests  of  a  child  are  an  integral  part  of  the
         proportionality assessment under article 8 ECHR;

    (2)  In making that assessment, the best interests of a child must be a
         primary  consideration,  although  not  always  the  only   primary
         consideration; and the child's best interests do not of  themselves
         have the status of the paramount consideration;

    (3)  Although the best interests of a child can be  outweighed  by  the
         cumulative effect of other considerations, no  other  consideration
         can be treated as inherently more significant;

    (4)  While different judges might approach the  question  of  the  best
         interests of a child in different ways,  it  is  important  to  ask
         oneself the right questions in an orderly manner in order to  avoid
         the risk that the best interests of a child  might  be  undervalued
         when other important considerations were in play;

    (5)  It is important to have a clear idea of  a  child's  circumstances
         and of what is in a child's best interests before one asks  oneself
         whether those interests  are  outweighed  by  the  force  of  other
         considerations;

    (6)  To that end there is no substitute for a  careful  examination  of
         all relevant factors when the interests of a child are involved  in
         an Article 8 assessment;

    (7)  A child must not be blamed for matters for such as the conduct  of
         a parent.

38.  Zoumbas was preceded by ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC where  Baroness  Hale
    stated the following, at [33]:

         "33. We now have a much greater understanding of the importance  of
             these issues in assessing the overall well-being of the child.
             In making the proportionality assessment under Article 8,  the
             best interests of the child must be a  primary  consideration.
             This means that they must be considered first.  They  can,  of
             course, be  outweighed  by  the  cumulative  effect  of  other
             considerations.   In    this    case,    the    countervailing
             considerations  were  the  need  to  maintain  firm  and  fair
             immigration  control,  coupled  with  the  mother's  appalling
             immigration history and the  precariousness  of  her  position
             when family life was created. But,  as  the  Tribunal  rightly
             pointed out, the children were not to be blamed for that.  And
             the inevitable result of removing their primary carer would be
             that they had to leave with her. On the facts, it is as  least
             as strong a case as Edore v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
             Department [2003] 1 WLR 2979, where Simon Brown LJ  held  that
             'there really is only room for one view' (para 26).  In  those
             circumstances, the Secretary of State  was  clearly  right  to
             concede that there could be only one answer."

39.  The two children involved in the case of  ZH  (Tanzania)  were  British
    citizens by virtue of having been born  to  a  British  citizen  father
    whereas Zoumbas concerned two  foreign  national  parents  and  foreign
    national children aged 7, 4 and 6 months who had been  here  unlawfully
    throughout the entirety of their short lives.

40.  The assessment of a child's best interests  must  focus  on  the  child
    whilst simultaneously  evaluating  the  reality  of  the  child's  life
    situation and circumstances.   Factors  such  as  parental  immigration
    misconduct must not intrude at this stage.  The child's best  interests
    once assessed are an important component to the overall proportionality
    balancing exercise.

41.      AW was aged five when he came here. He is now 8. ZW is  now  5.  He
    was aged 2 when he came here. Both boys have been here for  3  �  years
    (over half of ZW's life and almost half of AW's).  I  have  taken  into
    account that whilst both children have been here for a relatively short
    period of time in the life of an adult,  and  significantly  less  than
    seven years, it does amounts to a considerable period  of  their  young
    lives to date.

42.  I found the witnesses credible. There was no significant  challenge  to
    their evidence. I have attached significant weight to the evidence  the
    relationship between FA and his two nephews, in particular AW.  I  have
    also taken into account their family history to date. AW remembers  his
    biological father and his death.  He was diagnosed in 2013 with autism.
    He has displayed behavioural problems as evidenced by his uncle, mother
    and his aunt and supported by the evidence of the assessment  that  was
    conducted whilst in the US, Dr Mohamed and Dr Lisa-Renee Shaw.

43.      AW has formed a parental relationship with his uncle. He  sees  him
    as his "father". I find that FA has assumed parental responsibility  in
    the literal sense. I accept  that  he  does  not  have  legal  parental
    responsibility. (It is not necessary for an individual to have parental
    responsibility in law for there to exist a parental relationship see  R
    (RK) v SSHD [2016]).   There  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship between FA and AW. If FA has any reservations  about  this
    they arise from the uncertainty  of  AW's  status  and  the  impact  of
    separation if his appeal is dismissed. I accept Dr Mohamed's opinion in
    respect of the adverse effect of separation.   I  have  no  doubt  that
    separation would also adversely affect ZW, however; the effects  on  AW
    would be more profound because of  his  age,  the  attachments  he  has
    formed, life experiences and development problems.  In this case  I  do
    not hesitate to conclude that it would be in the best interests of both
    children, particularly AW, to remain here in the UK with their  mother,
    aunt, cousins and their uncle (who they consider as a father to them).



Para 276 ADE

44.  All the evidence points to  a  likely  deterioration  in  WK  and  AW's
    mental health should they have to return to the US and  I  accept  this
    would be the case. However, the appellants have  not  established  that
    there would be very significant obstacles to integration in the context
    of 276ADE (1) (vi).  Life would no doubt be very difficult for them  on
    return.  However it is unarguable that they would not, as US  citizens,
    receive welfare support,  education  and  medical  treatment.   In  any
    event, I find that FA and KA would be able to give them financial help.

Proportionality

 45.  WK is depressed and has experienced trauma. She  would  without  doubt
    find it extremely difficult to manage, as she has  done  in  the  past,
    without the help of her family. I accept the evidence of FA and  KA  in
    respect of her inability to properly cope on her  own  in  the  US  (as
    witnessed by them when visiting her there). She has genuine  difficulty
    in looking after her children, particularly AW, in the absence of their
    support. She is highly dependent on her sister and brother-in-law here.
     The fact that she would be without the  day-to-day  emotional  support
    from her family would have an impact on her ability as a parent and  to
    function generally which in turn would have an adverse effect  on  her.
    Whilst there would  be   sufficient  practical  and  financial  support
    available to her in the US (in addition to any  financial  support  she
    would be receive from her family here) she would  not  have  the  daily
    practical and significant emotional support of her family on which  she
    heavily relies.  I find that there is no objective threat from her  ex-
    husband's family. I accept however, that there is  a  subjective  fear.
    However, none of this, in itself is sufficient to outweigh  the  public
    interest.

46.  Since they cannot meet the requirements of  the  Rules  the  appellants
    have to show a compelling reasons to require the grant of leave outside
    of the Rules: R (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin), [29]; SS Congo)
    v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387; [2016] 1 All ER 706 [33].

47.      I must consider article 8 through the prism of section 117B of  the
    2002 Act[1]. The maintenance of effective immigration control is in the
    public interest. WK's immigration history is precarious.  The  strength
    of  the  public  interest  in  maintaining  immigration   control   was
    emphasised by the Supreme Court in R (Agyarko) v SSHD [2017]  UKSC  11.
    Where the immigration status of the family or some  members  of  it  is
    such that the persistence of family life within the  host  state  would
    from the outset be unlawful or as in this case precarious it was stated
    at [49] that particularly where individuals know this, and  absent  any
    protracted delay by the immigration authorities (which  there  has  not
    been in  this  case),  "  it  is  likely  only  to  be  in  exceptional
    circumstances" that the removal of a non-national  family  member  will
    constitute a violation of article 8.

48.   The child appellants cannot be blamed  for  their  precarious  status.
    However, it is a factor to  consider  when  assessing  proportionality.
    Whilst Section 117B (4) (a) and (5) of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 are confined to private life established by a person at
    a time when their immigration status is  unlawful  and  precarious,  it
    does not mean when answering the public interest question the  Tribunal
    should not have regard "precarious family life"  criteria  set  out  in
    established  Article  8  jurisprudence.   However,  the  judgement   in
    Jeunesse v Netherlands (2015) 60 EHRR 17 shows that it may be  possible
    to find in an exceptional case that even a non-settled  migrant  has  a
    sufficiently strong right to remain under article 8 such that it  would
    be disproportionate to remove them.

49.      When considering the phrase "financially  independent"  in  section
    117B (3) the Court in Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803 stated "this  is  an
    ordinary English phrase, and the FTT gave it its  natural  meaning,  as
    indicating someone who is financially independent of  others.  This  is
    the  correct  interpretation."   The  appellants  are  not  financially
    independent. This is a factor which counts against them in the  article
    8 balancing exercise. Whilst they are not at present  receiving  income
    support or any other benefit and FA's earnings are more than sufficient
    to take care of the family, the appellants are and will continue to  be
    a significant burden on the state in terms of at  least  education  and
    health provision and this factor weighs very heavily  against  them.  I
    accept that the  burden  is  less  than  it  might  be  because  FA  is
    unarguably able and willing to accommodate and maintain them.

50.   Reasonableness is not the issue here. The children are not  qualifying
    children. They are not British citizens and they have not been here for
    seven years. However, the facts are unusual because they each  enjoy  a
    relationship with their uncle, a British citizen, which is akin to that
    of father and son and the consequences of separation and return to  the
    US (or Pakistan) must be considered in that context.

51.  I attach appropriate weight to the assessment of  the  children's  best
    interests. It is not paramount, but  it  is  a  primary  consideration.
    Should AW  have to return with his mother and brother  to  the  US  (or
    Pakistan), he would be forced to separate from the uncle he now sees as
    his father and effectively experience the loss  of  a  father  for  the
    second time in his short life.  The loss would be compounded by his own
    developmental problems and significantly the  inevitable  deterioration
    in his mother's mental  health  and  her  poor  coping  strategies.   I
    conclude in favour of the appellants.  If it were not for the children,
    particularly AW and the relationship he enjoys with  his  family  here,
    particularly FA, I would have dismissed this appeal.  The unusual facts
    as  they  apply  to  AW  give  rise  to  compelling   and   exceptional
    circumstances outweighing the strong factors  that  count  against  the
    appellants and the public interest in removal.

[1]Section  117B  Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in
all cases
(1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
interest.
(2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the
economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter
or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons
who can speak English-
(a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
(b) are better able to integrate into society.
(3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the
economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter
or remain in the United Kingdom are financially  independent, because such
persons-
(a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
(b) are better able to integrate into society.
(4) Little weight should be given to-
(a) a private life, or
(b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the United
Kingdom unlawfully.
(5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a person
at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the public
interest does not require the person's  removal  where-
(a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a
qualifying child, and
(b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United
Kingdom.
