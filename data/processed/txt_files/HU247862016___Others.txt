Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms U Dirie, Counsel, instructed by J McCarthy
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are each citizens of the Gambia  whose  dates  of  birth
    respectively are recorded as 20th June 1980,  30th  August  2003,  11th
    October 1998 and 15th August 1998.  The First Appellant is  the  mother
    of the Second and Third Appellants  who  submitted  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal that she was also the adoptive parent of the Fourth Appellant.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. Application was made for the  family  to  join  the  First  Appellant's
    husband, a British citizen, in the United Kingdom. On 2nd February 2017
    decisions were made to refuse the application.   The  principal  reason
    for refusal in respect of the First, Second and  Third  Appellants  was
    that it was said that the requisite evidence pursuant to Appendix FM-SE
    had not been submitted in order to demonstrate the required  income  of
    �27,200 or more. It was the First, Second and  Third  Appellants'  case
    that the evidence had been submitted with the application.

 3. As to the Fourth Appellant it was said that  there  was  no  sufficient
    evidence of the adoption contended for.  The basis upon  which  it  was
    said that there was an adoption was a "de facto" adoption as set out in
    the final sentence of paragraph 5 of the Decision and Reasons of  Judge
    of the First-tier Head-Rapson who heard the appeal of  this  matter  on
    15th September 2017 when sitting at North Shields.  She  dismissed  the
    appeal on all grounds.

 4. Not content with that decision, by  Notice  dated  9th  November  2017,
    application for permission to appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    made, accompanied by grounds drafted by Counsel who appears  before  me
    today.  Those grounds assert that it was in the best interests  of  the
    Second, Third and Fourth Appellants that the family was to be  reunited
    but the grounds did not engage with the issue of de facto adoption  and
    the negative finding made by the judge on that issue.

 5. On 14th May  2018  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Boyes  refused
    permission.

 6. By Notice dated 12th June 2018 a renewed application was  made  to  the
    Upper Tribunal. Again, the renewed grounds were drafted by Counsel  who
    appears before me.  Those grounds were again silent on the issue of  de
    facto adoption.  However, on 20th September 2018, Upper Tribunal Judge
    Plimmer  granted  permission  on  the  grounds  which  related  to  the
    financial requirements not being met.  All other grounds were  said  to
    be arguable so permission was granted on them but that did not include,
    because it was not submitted, any  ground  to  do  with  the  de  facto
    adoption.

 7. The matter came before me and Ms Dirie, as a preliminary matter  sought
    permission to amend the grounds and have me grant  permission  for  the
    issue of the  de  facto  adoption  to  be  heard  in  this  appeal.   I
    considered that application by reference to  the  case  of  R  (on  the
    application of Onowu) -v- First-tier Tribunal (IAC) (extension of  time
    for appealing: principles) IJR [2016] UKUT 00185  (IAC).   That  was  a
    decision of the Vice President, Judge Ockelton, sitting  with  the  now
    Principal Resident Judge, Judge O'Connor, in what was a judicial review
    case.

 8. The guidance taken from the case of Mitchell -v- News Group  Newspapers
    Limited [2013] EWCA Civ 1537; Denton and White [2014] EWCA Civ 906  and
    the Crown (Hysaj) -v- Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]
    EWCA Civ 1663 was in short that there were three stages  that  a  judge
    should address in an application for relief in  circumstances  such  as
    these.  They are

      i) to identify and assess  the  seriousness  or  significance  of  the
         failure to comply with the Rules.  The focus should be  on  whether
         the breach has been serious or significant.  If a  judge  concludes
         that a breach is not  serious  or  significant,  then  relief  will
         usually be granted and it will usually be unnecessary to spend much
         time on the second or third stages, but if the judge  decides  that
         the breach is serious or significant  then  the  second  and  third
         stage is assumed greater importance;

     ii) to consider why the failure occurred.  That is to say whether there
         is good reason for it.  It was stated in Mitchell at  paragraph  41
         that if there is a good reason for the default, the court  will  be
         likely to decide that relief  should  be  granted.   The  important
         point made in Denton was that if there is a serious or  significant
         breach and no good reason for the breach this does  not  mean  that
         the  application  for  relief  will  automatically  fail.   It   is
         necessary in every case to move to the third stage;

    iii) to evaluate all the circumstances of the case, so as to enable  the
         court to deal justly with the application.

 9. The two factors specifically mentioned in Civil Procedure Rule 3.9 were
    said to be of particular importance and were  to  be  given  particular
    weight.  That is

      a) the  need  for  litigation  to  be  conducted  efficiently  and  at
         proportion of cost; and

      b) the need to enforce compliance with Rules, Practice Directions  and
         the court orders.

10. In this case the application is made just over a year out of time.   On
    any view the delay is significant.  Ms Dirie  quite  properly  did  not
    seek to persuade me otherwise.

11. The second question then is to consider why the failure occurred and Ms
    Dirie "held her hands up".  She overlooked the issue. She felt that  in
    drawing  attention  to  the  failure  of  the  judge  to  have   regard
    sufficiently to the best interests of the children she had captured the
    point, but she acknowledges, quite properly, that she had not done  so.



12. There were however opportunities for her to deal with the  point  on  a
    number of occasions. The first was in the drafting of the  grounds  for
    permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. That  opportunity  was
    overlooked. There was a second opportunity.  After refusal by the First-
    tier Tribunal, renewed grounds were drafted again by Ms Dirie when  she
    would have had an opportunity to look again at the file and the grounds
    which were being submitted.  Even then, in advance of  the  hearing  in
    preparation for today's appeal, there would have been an opportunity to
    raise the matter.  Only today at the hearing, before me, was the matter
    raised.

13. It may be some comfort to Ms Dirie and the litigants today that  having
    been shown the quality of the evidence that was being  relied  upon  in
    support of the de facto adoption, which speaks of the  First  Appellant
    being a recognised guardian of the Fourth Appellant and the like, in my
    judgment such was not sufficient evidence in any  event.   I  say  that
    because although the case was being advanced on the  basis  of  the  de
    facto adoption, there was little evidence on the point. There  was  the
    evidence in the various documents at Annex 11 onwards, but my principal
    concern was, as I have indicated,  the  evidence  was  not  sufficient,
    particularly against the necessity to protect young people  from  being
    trafficked.

14. In SK ("Adoption" not recognised in UK) India [2006]  UKAIT  00068  the
    Tribunal  said  that  the  restrictions  on  the  notion  of   adoption
    (paragraphs 6 and 310(vi)(a) and de facto adoption (paragraphs 309A and
    310(vi)(b)) are not shown to be contrary to Article 8, disproportionate
    or irrational. The point I would make is that in any  event  there  did
    not appear to be sufficient evidence to show that the finding  made  by
    the Judge in the first-tier was not one that was open to her.

15. Further although I cannot say this with any degree of certainty what  I
    would have done had an  error  of  law  been  identified,  it  is  most
    unlikely that had I dealt  with  the  case  I  would  have  come  to  a
    different view on the basis of the  evidence  that  I have  seen.   Of
    course, I have not heard submissions on the matter  because  I  refused
    permission for the matter to be dealt with at this late stage but as  I
    have said, I hope it is some comfort to everyone to  know  that  had  I
    granted permission it is unlikely to have made no difference.

16. I turn then to the substance of the appeal.  Some inquiries  were  made
    to see whether certain documents, which appeared to be missing from the
    bundle, which appears to have been  before  the  judge,  were  in  fact
    available to be produced to me.  So far as it was  necessary  to  grant
    permission for additional documentation to be produced I grant it.

17. If those various documents (a number of bank statements) could not have
    been produced, then I would have come to the  view  that  the  relevant
    documentation was not produced to the Secretary of State at the time of
    the application.  That necessarily follows  because  if  that  evidence
    could not be produced to me they could  not  have  produced  it  at  an
    earlier stage.

18. On the other hand given the large bundle of documents that  was  before
    the judge with which she does not appear properly to  have  engaged,  I
    come to the view that there would have  been  no  reason  not  to  have
    submitted that documentation with the application.  Mr Avery  does  not
    seek to persuade me otherwise.

19. As it was the documentation was  produced.  In  the  circumstances  the
    decisions in respect of the First, Second and Third Appellants are  set
    aside because there was an error of law by reason of the failure of the
    judge to engage  with  the  issue  of  whether  the  documentation  was
    submitted.

20. I  find  the  evidence  that  was  available  and  submitted  with  the
    application. I am able to remake the decision in respect of the  First,
    Second and Third Appellants on that basis such that their  appeals  are
    allowed.

21. As to the Fourth Appellant given that permission to appeal has not been
    granted and given that I have not granted permission for the grounds to
    be amended, for the reasons which  I  have  given,  the  decision  with
    respect to the Fourth Appellant remains.  Whether  in  due  course  the
    Fourth Appellant seeks to make application to the Secretary of State on
    the basis of better evidence will be a matter for the Fourth  Appellant
    and those giving advice.  What the Secretary of State does with that is
    entirely a matter for  the  Secretary  of  State.   It  should  not  be
    inferred from my observations that I am suggesting that  the  Secretary
    of State should grant relief one way or the  other.   I  am  not  doing
    that.  I am simply saying that the door is not necessarily firmly shut.



Notice of Decision

The appeals of the First, Second and Third Appellants to the Upper  Tribunal
are allowed. Their decisions are  set  aside  and  remade  such  that  their
appeals in the First-tier Tribunal are allowed.

The Fourth Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeals  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, I have considered making a fee award and have  decided  to  make  a
full fee award of �80 in each of the three appeals which have been  allowed.
I make no fee award in respect of the Fourth Appellant  as  the  Appeal  was
dismissed.
