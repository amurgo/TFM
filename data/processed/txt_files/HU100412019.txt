Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Dar, Archbold Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is appealing against the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Shore promulgated on 25 July 2019 dismissing his human
    rights claim.

 2. Mr Jarvis conceded that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    contained an error of law and should be set aside on the basis that (a)
    further evidence was submitted to the Tribunal prior to promulgation
    that was not considered in the decision and (b) the decision contains
    insufficient reasoning.

 3. Given the concession, I make the following decision:

Notice of Decision

 4. I set aside the decision of the First-Tier Tribunal and remit the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh before a different
    judge.
