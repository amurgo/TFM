               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mrs M Ahammed of RMS Immigration Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order made  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
      Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither party  invited
      me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule 14  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).



Background

   2. The appellants were born respectively on 1 September 1979, 10  October
      1981 and 7 January 2005 and are citizens of Bangladesh.  The first and
      second appellants  are  married  and  the  third  appellant  is  their
      daughter.  On 5 May 2013, the first appellant made an application  for
      further leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).  He did so on the  basis  of
      being part of an "entrepreneurial team" with  "MR".   The  second  and
      third appellants also sought further leave as dependents of the  first
      appellant.  On 21 June 2013, the Secretary of State refused the  first
      appellant's application  for  further  leave  to  remain  and  made  a
      decision to remove  him  by  way  of  directions  under  s.47  of  the
      Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The applications  of  the
      second and third appellants were refused in  line  with  that  of  the
      first appellant and decisions made to remove each of them  under  s.47
      of the 2006 Act.

The Appeal

   3. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
      heard by Judge Harmes.  The sole issue  under  the  Immigration  Rules
      before Judge Harmes was whether the first  appellant  could  establish
      that he (and his entrepreneurial partner,  MR)  possessed  the  funds,
      namely �50,000 as required  by  para  245DD  and  Appendix  A  of  the
      Immigration Rules.  Before Judge Harmes, the  first  appellant  relied
      upon a mini-statement stamped 5 June 2013 in relation to  a  Santander
      Bank Account in the name of his entrepreneurial partner and also a one
      page statement for a Santander Bank Account covering the period 4  May
      2013 to 4  June  2013  in  the  first  appellant's  name.   The  first
      appellant gave evidence before  Judge  Harmes  that  these  statements
      related to the same joint account (the account number  and  sort  code
      were the same) and that the explanation as to why only  one  name  was
      shown  was  that  it  reflected  who  had  requested  the   particular
      statement.

   4. Judge Harmes was not satisfied that the two statements  satisfied  the
      requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Secondly,  Judge   Harmes
      concluded that there was no unfairness in the Secretary of  State  not
      requesting further documentation for the first appellant in  order  to
      provide him with an opportunity to meet the requirements of the Rules.
      Finally, Judge Harmes found that the Secretary of State's decision did
      not breach Article 8 of the ECHR.

   5. On 10 January 2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Blandy) granted the
      appellants permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   Thus,  the
      appeals came before me.

   6. On behalf of the appellants,  Mrs  Ahammed  accepted  that  the  first
      appellant could not meet the requirements of the  Rules  in  that  the
      Rules required that the bank  statements  showed  the  names  of  both
      account holders, namely the first appellant and MR who  comprised  the
      entrepreneurial team.  However,  she  submitted  that  the  statements
      engaged the  'evidential  flexibility'  rule  in  para  245AA  of  the
      Immigration Rules.  She submitted that it was  obvious  from  the  two
      documents that they related to the same bank account  and  that  there
      was therefore some prospect of the  first  appellant  submitting  bank
      statements which complied with the  Rules.   She  submitted  that  the
      first appellant's case fell within the 'wrong format' element of  para
      245AA which required that the first appellant have an  opportunity  to
      submit documents in the correct format.  Secondly, she submitted  that
      the appeal should have been allowed under Article 8 of the ECHR.

Discussion

   7. It was accepted before the Judge that the only issue under  the  Rules
      was whether the first appellant could establish that he (together with
      his entrepreneurial partner) had access to "not less than �50,000 (see
      Table 4 in Appendix A).  Paragraph 52 of Appendix A provided,  so  far
      as relevant, as follows:

           "Entrepreneurial teams: notes

             52. Two applicants may claim points for the same investment and
                 business  activity  in  Tables  4,  5  or  6  provided  the
                 following requirements are met.

           Requirements:

              a) The applicants have equal level of control over  the  funds
                 and/or the business or businesses in question;

              b) The applicants are both  shown  by  name  in  each  other's
                 applications and in the specified evidence required in  the
                 relevant tables; ..."

   8. The specified evidence, in this case bank statements, is  set  out  in
      para 41-SD(a)(ii) which at the date of decision was as follows:

           "(a)  The specified documents to show evidence  of  the  funding
                 available to invest  are  one  or  more  of  the  following
                 specified documents;

           .....

                   ii) For money held in the UK only, a recent personal bank
                       or building society statement for each  UK  financial
                       institution holding the  funds,  which  confirms  the
                       amount of money available to the  applicant  (or  the
                       entrepreneurial team if applying under the provisions
                       in paragraph 52 of this  Appendix).   The  statements
                       must satisfy the following requirements:

                           1. The statements must be original documents  and
                              not copies;

                           2. The bank or building society holding the money
                              must be based in the UK and regulated  by  the
                              Financial  Conduct  Authority  (FCA)  and  the
                              Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA);

                           3. The money must be in cash in the account,  not
                              Individual Savings Accounts or assets such  as
                              stocks and shares;

                           4. The account must be  in  the  applicant's  own
                              name   only   (or   both    names    for    an
                              entrepreneurial team), not in the  name  of  a
                              business or third party;

                           5. Each bank or building society  statement  must
                              be on the  institution's  official  stationery
                              and confirm the applicant's  name  and,  where
                              relevant, the applicant's entrepreneurial team
                              partner's name, the  account  number  and  the
                              date  of  the  statement,  and  the  financial
                              institution's name and logo,;

                           6. The Bank or building  society  statement  must
                              have been issued by an authorised official  of
                              that institution and be  produced  within  the
                              three months immediately before  the  date  of
                              the application; and

                           7. If the statements are printouts of  electronic
                              statements, from an online account, they  must
                              either be accompanied by a  supporting  letter
                              from  the  bank,  on  company  headed   paper,
                              confirming the authenticity of the statements,
                              or bear the official  stamp  of  the  bank  in
                              question   and   on   each   page    of    the
                              statement;..."

      (The relevant provision, with some modifications, is now found in para
      41-SD(c)(ii) of Appendix A.)

   9. As those provisions make plain, the first appellant  was  required  to
      show that both he and his entrepreneurial partner had an "equal  level
      of control" over the funds relied  upon  (para  52)  and  the  account
      relied upon must be in both the name of the first  appellant  and  his
      entrepreneurial partner (see para 41-SD(c)(ii)(4))  and  the  relevant
      bank statements must confirm both the appellant's name and that of his
      entrepreneurial team partner see para 41-SD(c)(ii)(5)).

  10. As Mrs Ahammed accepted before me, neither bank statement relied  upon
      by the first appellant met those requirements.

  11. As a consequence, Judge Harmes was correct to conclude that the  first
      appellant could not meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.
      Although the Judge referred to the provisions of para 41-SD(b)(i) that
      deals with "third party" funds at para 18  of  his  determination  (no
      doubt because the respondent also had wrongly done so in her  decision
      letter), he set out at para 17, para 41-SD(a)(ii) the  application  of
      which was fatal to the first appellant's claim under the Rules.

  12. Given her concession on the application of the Rules  (rightly  made),
      Mrs Ahammed relied upon para 245AA of the Rules which from 6 September
      2012 set  out  the  respondent's  so-called  'evidential  flexibility'
      policy.  As at the date of decision, namely 21 June  2013  para  245AA
      provided as follows:

           "245AA.     Documents not submitted with the application

                         a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to  in
                            Part 6A state that specified documents must  be
                            provided,  the  UK  Border  Agency  will   only
                            consider documents which  have  been  submitted
                            with the application, and  will  only  consider
                            documents submitted after the application where
                            they  are  submitted  in  accordance  with  sub
                            paragraph (b).

                         b) If the applicant has submitted

                               i) A sequence of documents and  some  of  the
                                  documents  in  the  sequence   have   been
                                  omitted  (for   example,   if   one   bank
                                  statement from a series is missing);

                              ii) A document is in the wrong format; or

                             iii) A document that  is  a  copy  and  not  an
                                  original document,

                                  The  UK  Border  Agency  may  contact  the
                                  applicant   or   his   representative   in
                                  writing,   and   request    the    correct
                                  documents.  The requested  documents  must
                                  be received by the UK Border Agency at the
                                  address specified in the request within  7
                                  working days of the date of the request.

                         c) The UK Border Agency will not request documents
                            where  a  specified  document  has   not   been
                            submitted  (for  example  an  English  language
                            certificate   is  missing),  or  where  the  UK
                            Border  Agency   does   not   anticipate   that
                            addressing the omission or error referred to in
                            sub paragraph (b) will lead to a grant  because
                            the  application  will  be  refused  for  other
                            reasons.

                         d) If the  applicant  has  submitted  a  specified
                            document:

                               i) in the wrong format, or

                              ii) that it is a  copy  and  not  an  original
                                  document,

                            The application  maybe  granted  exceptionally,
                            providing the UK  Border  Agency  is  satisfied
                            that the specified documents  are  genuine  and
                            the applicant meets all the other requirements.
                             The UK Border Agency  reserves  the  right  to
                            request the specified original documents in the
                            correct format in all cases where (b)  applies,
                            and to refuse applications if  these  documents
                            are not provided as set out in (b)."

  13. Paragraph 245AA  has  been  subject  to  amendment  subsequently.   In
      particular, paragraph 245AA(b) has been  subject  to  some  linguistic
      rearrangements and from 1 October 2013 (therefore after  the  date  of
      decision in this case) so as to add an additional "(iv)" to  paragraph
      245AA(b).  That adds an additional instance where the UK Border Agency
      may write to an applicant and request the correct  document.   From  1
      October 2013, para 245AA(b)(iv) provided:

           "A document does not contain all of the specified  information".



  14.  Initially,  Mrs  Ahammed  placed  reliance  upon  para  245AA(b)(iv).
      However, it is clear that that provision has no  application  to  this
      appeal as it was not in force at the time of the decision on  21  June
      2013.

  15. As a  result,  Mrs  Ahammed  focussed  her  attention  upon  paragraph
      245AA(b)(ii) and submitted that the first appellant's bank  statements
      were in the "wrong format" because they omitted the name of the  other
      account holder.

  16. Mr Richards, on behalf of the Secretary of State  submitted  that  the
      absence of both account holders' names was not a defect  in  "format".
      He submitted that the Secretary of State was not required  to  request
      additional documentation, in these circumstances, by  virtue  of  para
      245AA.

  17. It is, of course,  plain  that  as  from  1  October  2013,  paragraph
      245AA(b)(iv) provides for the precise situation  in  which  the  first
      appellant was placed, namely that the document  (bank  statements)  he
      submitted did not "contain all the specified  information".   However,
      that provision was not in  force  at  the  time  of  the  respondent's
      decision on 21 June 2013 and the only basis  upon  which  Mrs  Ahammed
      puts the first appellant's case on 'evidential flexibility'  was  that
      the document was in the "wrong format".

  18. As an evidential tool, it  is  difficult  to  take  into  account  the
      subsequent addition of para 245AA(b)(iv) to interpret the  meaning  of
      "wrong format" before the former's introduction into the  Rule.   Even
      before its inclusion, I am satisfied that a document cannot be said to
      be in the "wrong format" simply  because  the  joint  account  holders
      names were not both included.  The ordinary and natural meaning of the
      word "format" is that it has something to do with the  arrangement  or
      presentation of the information set out in, for example,  a  document.
      In other words, "format" essentially relates to how  the  document  is
      presented or arranged, i.e. its "look".  Generally,  the  omission  of
      information will not alter the "look" or format.    It  may  well  be,
      however, that an absence of information may change the format  of  the
      document, for example where  the  document  is  not  set  out  on  the
      institution's official stationery so that  it  does  not  include  the
      financial institutions' name and  logo  (see,  for  example  para  41-
      SD(a)(ii)(5)).  That said, the absence of one  or  two  joint  account
      holders' names on a bank statement cannot, in my judgment,  convert  a
      bank statement otherwise in the correct format into one  which  is  in
      the "wrong format".  In the future, para 245AA(b)(iv) will cover  this
      situation but, for the reasons I have  given,  it  cannot  assist  the
      first appellant in these appeals.

  19. For these reasons, para 245AA did not apply to the first appellant.

  20. Before the Judge, Mrs Ahammed also relied upon the  decisions  of  the
      Upper Tribunal in  Thakur  (PBS  Decision  -  Common  Law  Unfairness)
      Bangladesh [2011] UKUT 00151 (IAC) and Naved  (Student  -  Fairness  -
      Notice of Points) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 0014 (IAC).  Judge  Harmes  set
      out the relevant headnotes of these two decisions at paras 21  and  22
      of his determination.  At para 23 he  went  on  to  distinguish  those
      cases as  having  no  application  to  the  first  appellant  for  the
      following reasons:

           "In the context of  this  appeal  the  appellant  has  not  been
           prejudiced by any inherent unfairness outside  his  control,  as
           was the case  in  both  of  the  above  cases.   In  Thakur  the
           appellant had not had an opportunity because of factors  outside
           his control.  In Naved he  did  not  know  of  the  Grounds  for
           refusal that he faced.   Both  situations  required  an  overall
           consideration of fairness to redress the balance.  That  is  not
           the case here.  An obligation on the respondent to assist  every
           appellant who does not comply with  the  technicalities  of  the
           Immigration Rules is too onerous and unworkable.  I find that in
           the context of this decision and the particular circumstances of
           this appellant he has not been prejudiced by  having  to  comply
           without more assistance from the respondent."

  21. Although the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal did not refer to,
      or rely upon, the decisions in Thakur and Naved,  for  completeness  I
      should add that I am in complete agreement  with  Judge  Harmes'  view
      expressed in para 23  that  neither  decision  can  assist  the  first
      appellant.  There are undoubtedly complexities  in  the  Points  Based
      System and the requirements of the  Rules;  however,  the  requirement
      that both account holders'  names  should  be  included  on  any  bank
      statements is clearly set out in Appendix A and the basis upon  which,
      therefore, the first appellant could not succeed under the  Rules  was
      not something of which the first appellant could  have  no  knowledge.
      The omission was, therefore, of his own making and was not outside his
      control such that fairness required the Secretary of State  to  notify
      him of the omission..

  22. For these reasons, I reject the first  appellant's  reliance  on  para
      245AA and, to the extent that he continued to do so, upon  the  common
      law principle of fairness.

  23. Finally, Mrs Ahammed submitted that the Judge should have allowed  the
      appeal under Article 8 because he had  not  applied  the  decision  in
      Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL27.  That is a submission  which  is  without
      any merit.

  24. Judge Harmes dealt with Article 8 of the ECHR at paras 26, 40 and  43.
      At paragraph 27, he set out the five  stage  questions  identified  by
      Lord Bingham of Cornhill in Razgar at [17].  At paras  30-34,  he  set
      out the factors in favour of the appellants'  continued  residence  in
      the UK and at paras 35-38 the factors in favour  of  removal  and  the
      public interest.  At paras 39-40, he balanced the need  for  effective
      immigration control  against  the  appellants'  circumstances.   Judge
      Harmes concluded that the legitimate aims of the  economic  well-being
      of the country and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others
      outweighed any interference with the appellants'  family  life  (given
      that they would return to Bangladesh as a family)  and  their  private
      life in the UK.  In her  oral  submissions,  Mrs  Ahammed  offered  no
      reasoned basis upon which it could be argued that the Judge  erred  in
      law in carrying out that balancing exercise.  The grounds of appeal to
      the Upper Tribunal do not do so either simply stating that  the  Judge
      "totally failed to consider the claim for private life  under  Article
      8" in the light of the authorities of Razgar and Huang v  SSHD  [2007]
      UKHL 11.  The Judge simply did not fall into that  error  and,  in  my
      judgment, Judge Harmes was entitled to reach the conclusion  that  the
      appellants had failed to establish a breach of Article 8.







Decision

  25. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's decision to  dismiss  the
      appellant's appeal on all grounds did not involve  the  making  of  an
      error of law.   The decision stands.

  26. The appellants' appeals to the Upper Tribunal are dismissed.
