                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan born on 22nd February 1991.
     He first arrived in the UK on 17th October  2010  when  he  was  given
    leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student until 28th February  2011.
    Later the Appellant was granted discretionary leave to remain until 2nd
    November 2012.  On 20th  October  2012  the  Appellant  applied  for  a
    variation of that leave.  That application was refused for the  reasons
    given in the Respondent's letter of 27th November 2013.  The  Appellant
    appealed, and his appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Behan (the Judge) sitting at Richmond on 2nd March 2015.  He decided to
    dismiss the appeal  on  asylum  grounds  but  to  allow  it  under  the
    provisions of paragraph 276ADE(vi) of HC 395 for the reasons  given  in
    his Decision dated 20th May 2015.  Both parties sought leave to  appeal
    that decision, and such permission was granted to both parties on  12th
    August 2015.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. I need only to concern myself with  the  dismissal  of  the  appeal  on
    asylum grounds for reasons which will become  apparent  later  in  this
    Decision.

 4. The Judge found the Appellant to be credible.  He found  as  fact  that
    the Appellant left Sri Lanka at the age of 8 years after which he lived
    with his family in India where they were recognised as refugees.  Since
    coming to the UK, the Appellant became a member of the  British  Tamils
    Forum (BTF) in November 2014.  As  such  the  Appellant  attended  four
    demonstrations  protesting  about  the  actions  of  the   Sri   Lankan
    government.  The BTF is an organisation proscribed by  the  Sri  Lankan
    Government since the spring of 2014 when it was announced that  members
    of the BTF travelling to  Sri  Lanka  would  be  arrested  under  anti-
    terrorism  legislation.   Nevertheless,  the  Judge  found   that   the
    Appellant would not be  at  risk  on  return  because  the  Sri  Lankan
    Government had not arrested any returning members of the BTF, and using
    its sophisticated intelligence measures would know that the Appellant's
    involvement  with  that  group  was  slight.   The  Appellant  did  not
    therefore come within any of the risk categories identified in  GJ  and
    Others (post-civil war: returnees)  Sri  Lanka  CG  [2013]  UKUT  00319
    (IAC).

 5. At the hearing, Mr Azmi argued that the Judge had made an error of  law
    in coming to this conclusion.  The Judge had failed to  apply  properly
    the relevant Country Guidance case.

 6. In a brief submission in response,  Mr  Mills  said  that  the  Judge's
    decision was sustainable upon the facts found by the Judge.  It was for
    the Judge to interpret the decision in GJ and Others.

 7. I do find an error of law in the decision of the Judge to  dismiss  the
    appeal on asylum grounds.  There is no dispute as to  the  facts  which
    are that the Appellant is a member of an organisation proscribed  as  a
    terrorist group by the Sri Lankan authorities because its purpose is to
    "mobilise British Tamils to propagate, defend, promote  and  accomplish
    the Tamils' cause for an independent homeland and  self-determination".
    The Appellant has been active within that organisation to the extent of
    attending four demonstrations.  The Sri Lankan Government have made  it
    clear that any member of  the  BTF  returning  to  Sri  Lanka  will  be
    arrested.  It is optimistic in  the  extreme  and  for  that  reason  a
    perversity for the Judge to decide that the Sri Lankan authorities will
    take a lenient view of the Appellant on the basis  that  his  political
    activities  in  the  UK  have  amounted  to  little.   The  Appellant's
    circumstances  come  squarely  within  those  identified   as   placing
    returnees at risk in paragraph (7) of the head note to GJ and Others.

 8. For these reasons I find a material error of law in the decision of the
    Judge to dismiss the appeal on asylum grounds  and  that  part  of  his
    decision I set aside.

Remade Decision

 9. At the hearing I proceeded to remake the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  For that purpose it was not necessary for me to  hear  again
    from the representatives.

10. The remade decision is that the appeal is allowed  on  asylum  grounds.
    For the reasons given above, I find that on his return to Sri Lanka the
    Appellant would be arrested on account of his political  activities  in
    the UK.  This would lead to his persecution.

11. Having made that decision, it is unnecessary for  me  to  consider  the
    Appellant's position under paragraph 276ADE of HC 395.

Notice of Decision

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss  the
    Appellant's appeal on asylum grounds did involve the making of an error
    on a point of law.

    I set aside that decision.

    I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it on asylum grounds.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order for anonymity which I continue.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appeal  has  been  allowed  on  asylum  grounds  on  the  basis  of  the
Appellant's original case.  In that event I make a fee award  in  favour  of
the Appellant for the full amount of ï¿½140.
