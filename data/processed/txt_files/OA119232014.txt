Representation:

For the Respondent:    Ms Brocklesby-Weller, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 History of Appeal


   1. The Appellant, who was born on 7  February  1983,  is  a  national  of
      Bangladesh. On 13 June 2014 he applied  for  entry  clearance  as  the
      spouse of a British citizen. His application was refused on 20  August
      2014. He appealed against this decision on 23 September 2014  and  the
      Entry Clearance Manager maintained the refusal on 19 February 2015.


   2. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow on  14  March
      2016 and he dismissed the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
      Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights on 1 April 2016.


   3. The Appellant sought permission to appeal against this decision on  26
      April 2016 and First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever granted  permission  to
      appeal on 9 September 2016.

Error of Law Hearing

   4. I heard oral submissions by Mr.  Ahmed.  He  relied  on  his  skeleton
      argument and submitted that the  sponsor  did  have  an  annual  gross
      income of �19,000. He also  submitted  that  Devaseelan  [2002]  UKAIT
      00702 did not apply as the Appellant had made an application for leave
      to remain, which was different in nature and character. He also relied
      on the fact that the Judge had referred to  facts  which  appeared  to
      relate to a completely different appeal and that this amounted  to  an
      error of law.


   5. Ms Brocklesby-Weller made oral submissions in reply.  She  noted  that
      there was no evidence about the existence of a child and the degree of
      relationship he or she may have with the Appellant.


Decision

   6. In order to meet the  requirements  of  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  (a)  the
      Appellant had to show that his sponsor had a gross annual income of at
      least �18,600. (In paragraph 8 the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  noted
      that, if the Appellant and sponsor did have a child, he would have  to
      have shown that the sponsor had a gross  annual  income  of  at  least
      �22,400. This was not correct as paragraph E-ECP.3.1 stated  that  for
      the purposes of this paragraph a child means a dependent child of  the
      applicant who is (c) not a British citizen. As the  Appellant's  child
      is said to be a British citizen, the Appellant does not have  to  meet
      the higher financial threshold. However, as  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge did not make his decision on the basis that  the  Appellant  did
      have a child, this error was not a material one.


   7. In order to establish that the sponsor had a gross annual income of at
      least  �18,600,  the  Appellant  also  had  to  meet  the   evidential
      requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  A1.2(a)
      requires the Appellant to show payslips covering a period of 6  months
      prior to the date of application, which was  13  June  2014,  and  (c)
      personal bank statements corresponding  to  the  same  period  as  the
      payslips showing that the salary has been paid into an account in  the
      name of the sponsor.


   8. The Entry Clearance  Officer  asserted  that  the  Applicant  had  not
      complied with this requirement. In contrast, it  was  the  Applicant's
      case that  he  had  provided  this  evidence  when  he  submitted  his
      application. He  relied  on  the  fact  that  when  he  submitted  his
      application he had confirmed that he  had  provided  evidence  of  the
      monthly  income  stated  on  the  application  form,  such   as   bank
      statements. However, he had not listed the precise pay slips  or  bank
      statements which he had submitted and in Part  8  of  his  application
      form. He just said that his wife was earning around �19,000  and  also
      had sufficient savings in her account. The covering letter  said  that
      bank statements and payslips were being enclosed but did  not  specify
      which ones.


   9. There were payslips from Blue Heron Catering Ltd in  the  Respondent's
      Bundle for September, October, November and December 2013 and  January
      and May 2014. Therefore, the Appellant had provided six  payslips  but
      they were not for a six-month period prior  to  the  application.  The
      Appellant had submitted an additional  bundle  in  preparation  for  a
      previous hearing on 30 September 2015, which had to be  adjourned  and
      this was said to contain copies of documents  not  passed  on  by  the
      Entry Clearance  Officer.  However,  there  were  not  any  additional
      payslips in this bundle. There was a witness statement by the sponsor,
      which asserted that she had been working for Blue Heron  Catering  Ltd
      since June 2013 but did not explain the gaps in her run of pay slips.


  10. The Appellant also relied on copies of bank statements for an  account
      held by the sponsor. The Respondent's Bundle contained bank statements
      confirming salary going  into  her  account  for  September,  October,
      November  and  December  2013  and  January  and  February  2014.  The
      Appellant's additional bundle  contained  bank  statements  confirming
      salary paid in for May and June 2014. However, these  bank  statements
      could not have been  submitted  with  the  application  as  they  were
      generated after the application was made. It  also  remains  the  case
      that not all of the pay slips and bank statements cover the  requisite
      same months.


  11. The Entry Clearance Officer also found that the  last  bank  statement
      submitted was noted dated within  28  days  of  the  application.  The
      latest bank statement in the Respondent's Bundle gave the balance  for
      25 April 2014. The Appellant's Bundle contained documents  which  were
      said to have been omitted from  the  Bundle  by  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer. However, there was no statement for the period up to  25  May
      2014 and, as mentioned above, the two  statements  that  were  in  the
      bundle were generated after the application was made.


  12. The Appellant did not argue that evidential  flexibility  should  have
      been applied but merely argued that  the  correct  evidence  had  been
      supplied. As explained above, he has not shown that  he  was  able  to
      meet the necessary evidential requirements.


  13. I accept that the last two paragraphs on page 4 of  his  decision  and
      the first paragraph of page 5 of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Callow's
      decision included factual  material  which  was  not  related  to  the
      Appellant's appeal.  However,  he  did  not  directly  refer  to  this
      material when dismissing the Appellant's appeal and  the  findings  he
      had previously made about the sponsor's payslips and  bank  statements
      were sufficient to establish that the Appellant  could  not  meet  the
      necessary evidential requirements.  Therefore, there was  no  material
      error of fact which could amount to an error of law as described in  E
      & R [2004] EWCA Civ 49.


  14. Furthermore, First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow was  correct  to  remind
      himself that in the light of Devaseelan his starting point must be the
      findings  made  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hollingworth  in  the
      previous appeal hearing.  It was argued that the  current  appeal  was
      different  in  nature  and  character.   However,   they   were   both
      applications for leave to enter as the dependent of the  same  spouse.
      In addition, First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow reminded himself of  the
      details of the decision in Devaseelan. He  was  entitled  to  rely  on
      First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Hollingworth's  findings  in  relation  to
      Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in  paragraph  52
      of his decision.


  15. He then went on to draw  on  the  guidance  contained  in  R  (on  the
      application of Sunassee) v  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
      Chamber) [2015] EWHC 1604 (Admin). First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Callow
      referred to the most relevant parts of this judgement. In  particular,
      he noted that "if the Rules are not met, then the public  interest  is
      served unless a factor can be identified that was  not  covered  under
      the Rules".  The Appellant did not identify any such gap, which  would
      justify a grant of leave on Article 8 grounds outside the  Immigration
      Rules.


  16. The First-tier Tribunal Judge also noted that the Appellant  had  also
      not identified any factors of especially compelling force in favour of
      a grant, as found in Nagre. He also correctly referred to section 117B
      of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. As a consequence,
      the manner in which the Judge considered Article 8 was in keeping with
      the relevant and most up to date case law.


  17. It was also argued on behalf of the Appellant that First-tier Tribunal
      Judge Callow had failed  to  take  into  account  section  55  of  the
      Borders, Citizenship and Immigration 2009 and the  best  interests  of
      the Appellant's child. However,  in  answer  to  question  63  of  his
      application form,  the  Appellant  said  that  he  did  not  have  any
      dependent children. In addition, the letter from the  London  Training
      Centre, dated 19 May 2014, did not mention that any child  was  living
      with the sponsor and there was no other evidence relating to a  child.
      There was also no mention of a child in the grounds of appeal  against
      the Respondent's decision  and  the  record  of  proceedings  did  not
      indicate that any submissions about section 55 were made at the appeal
      hearing.






  18. For all of these reasons  I  find  that  the  decision  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Callow did not include any material errors of law.

Decision

  19. The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.


  20. First-tier Tribunal Judge Callow's decision is upheld.
