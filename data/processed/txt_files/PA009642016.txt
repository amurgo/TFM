                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Parkash Aujla), sitting at Taylor House on 10  January,
    to  an asylum and human rights appeal by a citizen of Iraq, born  1982.
    The appellant is a Sunni Muslim, but married to a Shi'a.

 2. The appellant's claim was based on an encounter he said he had had with
    some men in a caf� towards the end of July 2015. He said they had asked
    him whether he supported the Shi'a militia, or  the  [Sunni]  so-called
    'Islamic State', otherwise  known  as  Daesh.  The  appellant  said  he
    supported neither, as both killed innocent people. Three days later the
    appellant's father's house was raided by the Shi'a militia, looking for
    him; but he was at his uncle's at  the  time.  Then  on  4  August  the
    militia kidnapped and killed his brother; so he left by lorry for  this
    country on the 8th, and claimed asylum on arrival on the 18th.

 3. That account was supported, to an extent, by a  statement  obtained  by
    the appellant's solicitors over the phone from his  father-in-law,  who
    he had told about the incident  in  the  caf�.  His  father-in-law  had
    warned  the  appellant  about  the  danger   of   getting   into   such
    conversations, especially as both he  and  his  wife  had  already  had
    problems over their mixed marriage. The first-hand part of the  father-
    in-law's evidence involved his finding the appellant's  brother's  body
    dumped on the street with gunshot wounds.

 4. The judge gave considerable trouble and thought  to  his  decision.  At
    paragraphs 34 - 36, he expressed the view that the  appellant  was  not
    reasonably likely to have had the trouble he did over  simply  refusing
    to support either side; but he disbelieved his account of the  incident
    in evidence, on the basis of what were said to be contradictory answers
    he had given at interview. The judge said this at paragraph 35:

       "At one point [the appellant] stated that the men who asked  him  the
       question [about his allegiance] were not known to him  but  regularly
       visited the coffee house. He then stated that they  were  friends  of
       his. If they were strangers, it begs the question why  the  Appellant
       would engage in conversation with them about such a sensitive  issue,
       given  the  current  atmosphere  in  Iraq,  especially  the   capital
       Baghdad."

 5. The problem with that is that the appellant had made his position clear
    in answer to Q63 at his interview:

       "I was sitting with my 3 friends. The other 4 were sitting at a  sofa
       not far from us. These 4 knew my friends. They are  friends  with  my
       friends but I never spoke to them before. They started shouting to my
       friends.  I  noticed  their  conversation  became  argumentative  and
       political. I didn't engage with them and  then  they  asked  me  that
       question."

    If accepted, this explanation was clearly capable of dealing  with  the
    point raised by the judge at paragraph 35; but he did not consider it.

 6. As Mr Kandola pointed out, the judge sensibly went on at  paragraph  36
    to deal with the appellant's case on an 'even if' basis,  finding  that
    the conversation would not in any case have exposed  him  to  any  real
    risk on return. The problem with this finding is that it did  not  take
    account of the appellant's father-in-law's evidence that it had led  to
    very real trouble for the family, so that a valid  credibility  finding
    on that was also required.

 7. The judge dealt with the father-in-law's evidence at  paragraphs  32  -
    33. Contrary to what he said there, there can be no  criticism  of  the
    way it was obtained. Such statements are regularly taken over the phone
    by employees of an appellant's solicitors; and  much  better  that  way
    than being left to appellants  themselves  to  narrate.  One  can  well
    imagine the cross-examination of this appellant, if no attempt had been
    made to confirm his account.

 8. The judge was fully entitled to point out  that  the  identity  of  the
    speaker at the other end of the phone was not established by any  other
    evidence than the details the appellant had provided  himself;  but  he
    did not deal with the contents of the father-in-law's statement at all.
    It follows that his rejection of it is really based on  his  view  that
    statements taken in this way could not amount to significant  evidence.
    This is wrong, as explained at 7.



 9. The result is that, despite the great care taken by the judge over this
    case, there will have to be a fresh hearing before another judge.
