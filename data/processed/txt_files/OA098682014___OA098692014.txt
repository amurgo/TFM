Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr B Hawkin, instructed by Fisher Meredith
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants  appeal,  with  permission  from  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Kopieczek, against a decision of First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  their
    appeal against the refusal by the Entry Clearance Officer on 6th August
    2014 to  allow  them  entry  clearance  to  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    appellants are citizens of Nepal born on [ ] 1995 and [ ] 2000  and  on
    28th November 2013 they made an application for entry clearance to join
    their parents, one of whom is present and settled in the UK and one  of
    whom has limited leave to remain.  At the date of the  applications  in
    2013 it was stated in the applications that the father was British.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Adio  dismissed  the  appeals  making  his
    findings further to Appendix FM, stating that the appellants  were  not
    exempt from the financial requirements as defined  under  paragraph  E-
    ECP.3.3.1.  Judge Adio appeared to accept that  the  respondent  "noted
    that the sponsor needs a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum  or
    if applying with one child �22,400 and an additional  �2,400  for  each
    additional child".

 3. Permission to appeal was filed, stating that the issue of discretion in
    relation to the relevant specified documents that the  entry  clearance
    should have considered was not exercised by the Entry Clearance Officer
    and further the matter should have been considered under paragraph  297
    of the Immigration Rules and it was not.  Further  Article  8  was  not
    considered.

 4. It was apparent from the hearing that both  the  children  remained  in
    Nepal whilst both parents are in the  UK.   Mr  Hawkin  and  Mr  Walker
    agreed that the relevant Rule was  paragraph  297  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and not Appendix FM which was applied by both the Entry Clearance
    Officer and Judge Adio.  The relevant Rule would be Appendix 297(i)(f).

 5. Both of the decisions in relation to these children, one of whom was 15
    years old and one of whom was 13 years at the date of the  application,
    revealed that the Entry Clearance Officer had applied the  requirements
    further  to  EC-P.1.1(d) -  Section  E-ECP:  "eligibility  for  entry
    clearance as a partner".  That was the incorrect Rule applied  in  both
    cases and I find that the judge adopted this  error  in  his  decision.
    Paragraph 297 was not considered.  I therefore find an error of law and
    the matter should be returned as agreed by both representatives  before
    me at the hearing to the Entry Clearance Officer for decision under the
    appropriate Rule.  It would appear that the wrong  factual  matrix  has
    been applied. I note that further to CP (Section 86(3) and  (5);  wrong
    immigration rule) Dominica [2006]  UKAIT  00040  it  can  be  that  the
    Immigration Judge should apply the correct  rule  but  also  that  'The
    issue of fairness will most likely arise where  the  substance  of  the
    correct rule differs from that applied by the decision-maker' [18]. The
    rule to be applied here is not substantially the same rule.

 6. The appeal is allowed to that extent  set  out.   It  is  open  to  the
    appellant to submit further documentation in support of the application
    if the appellant so wishes.  That said it is clear that the  fact  that
    both parents of the appellants are in the UK and they  are  effectively
    without their parents would suggest compelling reasons for  considering
    them under paragraph 297(i)(f).  The necessary details of the sponsor's
    income and housing costs will be relevant  further  to  KA  and  Others
    (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan [2006]  UKIAT  0065  which  made  it
    clear that the yardstick to be used was an  objective  comparison  with
    the funds received by the family on income support  and  the  level  of
    income.  The sponsor now maintains that he is employed  by  New  Claire
    Wine Limited and produced evidence to that effect in the form  of  P60s
    from his employer.  No challenge was made to the P60s.  The sponsor had
    been employed by New Claire Wine on a full-time permanent  basis  since
    1st December 2013 with an annual salary of �19,000 and also worked for
    Wincanton from 2nd January 2014 with an annual income of �16,445.   His
    wife also has an annual salary of  �14,144.   The  documentation  would
    suggest that the sponsors have in excess of at least �30,000 per annum.
     No issue was taken in relation to the rented accommodation and I  have
    no doubt that information regarding the council tax and rent would need
    to be submitted but it would be surprising if  the  sponsor  could  not
    meet the objective requirements set out in relation to income  support.
    Clearly the relevant information would need to  be  submitted  but  the
    children applied in 2013.  I note the father and sponsor has a British
    passport dating from at least 1st August 2011.

 7. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.  I set aside the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision  under  section
    12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007.

Order

 8. The appeal is allowed to the extent set out above in that it should  be
    returned to the Entry Clearance Officer for a lawful decision.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of  court  proceedings.   The
decision involves minors.



Signed                                  Date 20th April 2016


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
because the appeal is only allowed in that it awaits a lawful decision.


Signed                                  Date 20th April 2016
