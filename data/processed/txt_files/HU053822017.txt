                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Muntasir Al Mustakim, a citizen  of  Bangladesh
       born 25 October 1985, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
       of 6 June 2018 to dismiss his  appeal,  itself  brought  against  the
       refusal of his human rights claim on 11 February 2017.








  Introduction


    2. The Appellant entered the UK on 26  August  2003,  with  leave  as  a
       student extended until 30 November 2009. During that leave he applied
       for a residence card as the spouse  of  a  Czech  national,  Katerina
       Tkadleckova, which was issued to him on 17 February 2015. On  30  May
       2013 he applied for a  permanent  residence  card,  that  application
       being refused on 4 March 2014 and the residence card  being  revoked,
       with a right of appeal.

    3. Although he brought an appeal against the  residence  card  decision,
       the Appellant subsequently  withdrew  it,  preferring  to  pursue  an
       application for indefinite leave  to  remain  under  the  Immigration
       Rules on long residence grounds. Given that he had lacked leave under
       the Rules for a  significant  period,  that  application's  viability
       depended on his contention that a significant period of his residence
       in the UK was nevertheless lawful as a matter  of  EEA  law,  as  the
       partner of an  EEA  national  exercising  Treaty  Rights  here.  That
       application was made on 17 February 2015 and upon its  determination,
       the refusal was treated as a human rights claim, and hence a right of
       appeal arose. Within that application the Appellant also  raised  his
       relationship with Eva Rezankova, a British citizen of Czech origin.

  The refusal and grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal


    4. Refusing the application, the Secretary of State did not accept  that
       the Appellant had  ever  been  in  a  genuine  relationship  with  Ms
       Tkadleckova. A home visit by the immigration service  of  5  November
       2013 in relation to his  outstanding  marriage  application  with  Ms
       Tkadleckova had resulted in an encounter with  Ms  Rezankova  at  the
       same address. The answers regarding his wife's absence given by  both
       her and the Appellant were thought inconsistent and implausible;  the
       decision maker concluded that the relationship  with  Ms  Tkadleckova
       had been  a  marriage  of  convenience  all  along.  Accordingly  the
       Appellant had not shown he had been living  in  the  UK  consistently
       with the EEA Regulations over the relevant period.  Additionally,  he
       had been convicted of driving with excess alcohol on 5 November 2013,
       which merited refusal of a settlement application under the  relevant
       suitability criteria. As to his present  circumstances,  it  was  not
       accepted that his relationship with Ms  Rezankova  was  genuine,  and
       even it was, it was  not  accepted  that  there  were  insurmountable
       obstacles to life together abroad.

    5. The Appellant appealed against that refusal. His case on  appeal  was
       essentially  that  there  were  insurmountable   obstacles   to   his
       relocation with Ms Rezankova to Bangladesh and/or that he would  face
       very significant obstacles to integration  there,  that  they  had  a
       viable claim under the Immigration Rules (immigration  status  apart)
       such that the Chikwamba principle should be applied  in  his  favour,
       and that the immigration decision was generally  disproportionate  to
       the public interest it sought to uphold. In its impressively detailed
       decision, the First-tier Tribunal noted that  it  was  not  suggested
       that the Appellant had any right  to  remain  in  the  UK  under  the
       Citizens Directive, nor that the long residence application under the
       Rules was viable.


  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal


    6. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the evidence of Ms Rezankova,  which
       it considered impressive  in  its  spontaneity,  and  not  reasonably
       capable of having been concocted. Accordingly the Judge accepted both
       that the Appellant  had  been  in  a  genuine  relationship  with  Ms
       Tkadleckova in the past, and  that  he  was  now  in  a  genuine  and
       subsisting relationship with Ms Rezankova now. It  accepted  that  he
       had met Ms Tkadleckova in 2005, and began to live with  her  in  June
       2006; they married on 22 March 2007, and ran a business  together  in
       the ATM market for some time. They visited Ms Tkadleckova's family in
       the  Czech  Republic  more  than  once.  Their  relationship  was  in
       difficulties by summer 2010 and Ms Tkadleckova  moved  out  of  their
       home to reside with friends  in  London;  he  learned  that  she  was
       pregnant with another man's child in December 2010. She had left  the
       UK in April 2011, and returned to the Czech Republic to have her baby
       there; subsequently she had only returned to the UK for  the  purpose
       of visits.

    7.  Accordingly  the  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted  that  the  history
       provided of the two relationships was a credible one.  The  Appellant
       had nevertheless been less than forthcoming in his dealings with  the
       Secretary of State. In particular he had not  disclosed  his  claimed
       Sponsor's departure from the UK for a significant period,  a  failure
       which had led to the Respondent's suspicions as to the possibility of
       his marriage being one of  convenience.  The  Judge  noted  that  the
       Suitability criteria that had been invoked regarding the  Appellant's
       conviction did not bite on a non-settlement case.

    8. The Tribunal then applied its mind to the  question  of  whether  the
       Appellant and his partner faced insurmountable obstacles and/or  very
       significant  obstacles  to  integration  were  they  to  relocate  to
       Bangladesh. The Judge noted  that  Mr  Turner  had  dealt  with  this
       subject relatively briefly, notwithstanding that to make such a  case
       required a party to surmount  a  high  threshold,  as  shown  by  the
       authorities such as Agyarko. Of course, Ms Rezankova had no ties with
       the country whatsoever and was not  familiar  with  its  language  or
       culture. However, that factor aside, they were a healthy young couple
       with only limited ties to the UK, and  their  circumstances  did  not
       begin to cross that threshold.

    9. As to their case outside the Immigration  Rules,  the  Appellant  had
       been present on a precarious basis, given that he was in domestic law
       an overstayer. His assertion of historic lawful  residence  here  was
       predicated on a marriage that had broken  down  some  years  ago  and
       where his EEA Sponsor had  subsequently  left  the  country.  He  had
       clearly had no EEA residence  rights  from  that  time  onwards;  his
       residence card may have indicated the contrary, but  he  was  clearly
       aware of the true circumstances, and had chosen not  to  advance  his
       relationship with Ms Rezankova as a basis for seeking recognition  of
       residence rights as an extended family member.

   10. Mr Turner focussed his arguments below on the  proposition  that  the
       Appellant had  been  poorly  advised  as  to  his  options  vis-ï¿½-vis
       regularising his immigration status. Thus he  had  lost  out  on  the
       opportunity to make a viable application. The First-tier Tribunal was
       unimpressed by this submission. The instructions he had  provided  to
       his former lawyers, Blavo and Co, in June 2013,  were  predicated  on
       his remaining married to Ms Tkadleckova (and on good terms with her).
       The Judge noted that  the  advice  the  firm  then  gave  was  wholly
       appropriate based on  the  information  received:  he  had  given  an
       account that suggested he remained the family member of  a  qualified
       person, and was thus entitled to a permanent residence card given the
       length of time over which this situation had endured.

   11. As the First-tier Tribunal observed, the Appellant had  not  informed
       Blavo and Co that Ms Tkadleckova had in fact departed the UK in April
       2011 and only returned for visits thereafter. Had they been aware  of
       this fact, they might well have considered  any  application  as  her
       family member rather differently: since they  had  married  in  2007,
       less than five years previously, he  would  not  at  that  time  have
       acquired permanent residence in  his  own  right,  and  her  loss  of
       "qualified  person"  status  following  her  departure  from  the  UK
       prevented him enjoying any enduring right of residence as her spouse.
       Had the true circumstances been explained, they might have gone on to
       investigate whether there was any  other  relevant  consideration  in
       play, such as his relationship with Ms Rezankova. But  this  did  not
       happen. Accordingly it was understandable that Blavo and Co had  made
       a permanent  residence  application  on  his  behalf,  based  on  the
       information provided to them, and it was understandable that they had
       not advised him to make an application on domestic law long residence
       grounds. Such an application would not have been viable on  the  true
       underlying  facts  (as  he  had  insufficient  residence  under   the
       Immigration  Rules  and  any  rights  of  EEA  residence  that  might
       potentially have plugged the gap would have lapsed  for  the  reasons
       just explained).


   12. Accordingly the First-tier Tribunal rejected the submission that  the
       Appellant had been materially disadvantaged by the advice of previous
       lawyers. This left the question of whether the Appellant should  join
       the queue to seek entry clearance as envisaged by the Rules. As shown
       by the line of authority in  Chikwamba,  Hayat  and  Tikka,  where  a
       relationship, if reiterated via a future entry clearance application,
       would foreseeably satisfy the criteria of the Immigration Rules as  a
       partner, it might  be  disproportionate  to  enforce  an  essentially
       procedural  requirement.   However,   as   those   authorities   also
       demonstrate, this was subject to the question of  whether  there  was
       any "sensible reason" to expect the Appellant  to  return  abroad  to
       meet the formal requirement of obtaining entry clearance.  The  Judge
       noted he had been  economical  with  the  truth  as  to  how  he  had
       presented his case to the Respondent in the past  (having  failed  to
       disclose Ms Tkadleckova's return abroad to Blavo and Co,  and  failed
       to  reveal  the  breakdown  of  his  relationship  with  her  to  the
       immigration officers who conducted the home visit). Accordingly there
       was a sensible reason, having regard to the  important  consideration
       of maintaining immigration control, for requiring the entry clearance
       route to be enforced.


  Onwards appeal


   13. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in
       law by


      a) Failing to take account of all relevant considerations in
         assessing the question of insurmountable obstacles, particularly
         those relevant to the difficulties that the Appellant and Sponsor
         would face in making a life for themselves in Bangladesh given
         they were a mixed race couple facing relocation to a strict
         Islamic country in which Ms Rezankova had never lived;



      b) Making a perverse decision as to the potential applicability of
         the Chikwamba principle given that the Tribunal had differed from
         the Secretary of State in its assessment of the asserted
         relationship between the Appellant and Ms Rezankova;



      c) Failing to take account of all relevant considerations in
         determining the appeal outside the Immigration Rules.

   14. Permission to appeal was granted without restriction, though  express
       attention was given to the arguability of the ground challenging  the
       consideration of insurmountable obstacles as unduly brief, bearing in
       mind  the  favourable  finding  on  the  evidence  of  Ms   Rezankova
       generally.


   15. Before me Mr Turner emphasised those factors of the case which in his
       submission amounted to insurmountable  obstacles  to  return  abroad.
       The relationship of Appellant and Sponsor would not be accepted in  a
       strict Muslim country such as Bangladesh: they  would  be  unable  to
       proclaim their relationship  as  a  couple  there.  The  Home  Office
       Guidance  on  Minority  Religious  Groups  recorded   evidence   that
       Christians were at the bottom of the social hierarchy; and  the  CPIN
       on Women fearing gender based violence set out problems such as those
       heralded in its title. If  inter-faith  marriages  provoked  violence
       then surely inter-faith cohabitation would surely foreseeably provoke
       adverse attention too. That Guidance had escaped the attention of the
       First-tier Tribunal, Mr Turner not having produced it, but it was his
       case that it had been the duty of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  put
       forward  such  material  if  wishing  to  advance  a  case  that  was
       inconsistent with it.

   16. Mr Turner contended that there was simply insufficient acknowledgment
       of the positive factors that had been found in the Appellant's favour
       in the First-tier Tribunal's decision. This  was  a  case  where  the
       First-tier Tribunal had accepted a significant change  of  background
       from that upon which the Home Office had determined  the  appeal.  It
       had accepted that each of the Appellant's asserted relationships  had
       been genuine at relevant times; the Judge should have  factored  that
       conclusion into the  proportionality  equation.  The  "insurmountable
       obstacles" aspect of the case had received minimal attention compared
       to the detail afforded to other issues.  Furthermore,  the  Appellant
       had changed his name by deed poll to Joshua Maal, which was itself  a
       strong indication of his degree of integration in the UK.

   17. Mr Walker submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had carried  out  an
       impeccable consideration of all relevant issues by reference  to  the
       appropriate legal principles.

Findings and reasons

   18. As can be seen from my summary of the reasoning below, the First-tier
       Tribunal   decision   is   detailed   and   impressively    reasoned.
       Nevertheless, this does not immunise it from the possibility of being
       flawed by legal error, and Mr Turner has permission to so argue.


   19. As noted by the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Turner primarily argued below
       on the basis that a failure in the legal advice previously  given  to
       his client amounted to the kind  of  exceptional  circumstances  that
       could show that his departure from the UK would be  disproportionate.
       Indeed, the lack of objective evidence before the Judge below  as  to
       the insurmountable obstacles said to be faced by the couple abroad is
       now highlighted by the indirect route by  which  supporting  material
       has now been sought to be adduced.

   20. It seems to me that the treatment of the argument of inadequate legal
       advice was impeccably dealt with by the First-tier  Tribunal;  indeed
       before  me  Mr  Turner  did  not  seriously  suggest  otherwise.  The
       Appellant had indeed been  less  than  forthcoming  as  to  his  true
       circumstances, both with his  former  legal  advisors  and  with  the
       Secretary of State. As noted by Judge Blundell,  the  departure  from
       the UK of Ms Tkadleckova removed any lawful basis from his own  stay.
       Any residence card represents only the official understanding of  the
       underlying legal reality.

   21. In her witness statement for the appeal hearing  below  Ms  Rezankova
       stated, of the Appellant, that "His  proposed  removal  from  the  UK
       would be not just a personal disaster for Joshua and myself but  also
       a huge loss for the many people who befriended him over  the  years."
       It is difficult to find very much else by way of evidence rather than
       assertion. Undoubtedly  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal  raise  numerous  issues  that  might,   if   addressed   by
       appropriately detailed independent evidence,  together  amount  to  a
       viable case of insurmountable obstacles. But the  material  emanating
       from the Appellant and Sponsor themselves was slight in the extreme.


   22. The first ground of appeal to the Upper Tribunal attacks  the  First-
       tier  Tribunal's  approach  to  the  assessment   of   insurmountable
       obstacles based on the cultural differences between life in  the  UK,
       as  opposed  to  life  in  Bangladesh,  for  a  couple  of  different
       ethnicities, where one is  of  Czech  origin.  This  ground  was  not
       advanced in  the  conventional  manner,  by  reference  to  objective
       evidence that was before  the  Judge  below.  Thus  the  Home  Office
       Guidance first entered the  proceedings  before  me  when  Mr  Turner
       referred  to  a  witness  statement  of  4  September  2018  from  Ms
       Rezankova. No Rule 15 application was made to adduce  that  evidence,
       and besides, as I pointed out at the time, it fell foul of the  self-
       evident necessity that an error of law be  established  via  material
       that was in evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.

   23. Mr Turner sought to bypass this objection to the way his case was put
       on the basis that the Secretary of State had been under  a  duty,  as
       identified by UB (Sri Lanka) [2017] EWCA Civ 85, to  put  it  forward
       this material of his own motion.

   24. However,  I  do  not  think  that  this  approach  to  litigation  is
       acceptable. It was readily apparent that the  Appellant  below  would
       need to demonstrate insurmountable obstacles to relocation abroad  if
       his fall-back argument, as to the  alleged  failings  of  past  legal
       advisors, was to fail. The insurmountable obstacles  argument  is  in
       principle the primary point, given it is  the  focus  of  the  Rules.
       Issues such as inadequate legal advice and  the  Chikwamba  principle
       are logically secondary in nature, arising only if the case under the
       Rules is not made out.

   25. The various pieces of Guidance referenced by Mr Turner are to my mind
       not sufficiently clear cut as to have raised  an  obligation  on  the
       Presenting Officer  to  draw  them  to  the  Judge's  attention.  For
       example,  the  Guidance  on  Minority  Religious  Groups  speaks   of
       Christians being at the  bottom  of  Bangladesh's  social  hierarchy,
       suffering  significant  discrimination  and  extortion,  for  example
       damaging their access to a livelihood by way of  rickshaw-driving  or
       their access to public wells. However it is very difficult to imagine
       that this state of affairs applies  to  a  returning  national  whose
       family have been able to finance his  UK  studies  and  who  must  be
       presumed  to  have  always  had   his   return   to   Bangladesh   in
       contemplation. He and his Sponsor would present to the outside  world
       as a relatively sophisticated couple and must  be  presumed  to  have
       something by way of social capital by way of his extended family  and
       friends to  draw  upon.  There  are  reports  of  occasional  violent
       incidents against Christians in particular parts of the country,  but
       I have seen no overt evidence that any such  risks  would  extend  to
       someone like Ms Rezankova, ie a person of European origin  who  would
       presumably be living in an urban environment.

   26. One organisation is recorded as stating this:


           "... disadvantaged groups of women and  girls,  including  Dalit
           women, women with disabilities, elderly women, Rohingya  refugee
           women and women of ethnic minorities face multiple  intersecting
           forms of discrimination due to their gender, health,  indigenous
           identity, caste and socio-economic status"

   27. Ms Rezankova clearly does not fall into any of those groups. So  once
       again, I do  not  think  that  one  can  fairly  conclude  that  this
       published Guidance, which of course is articulated in the context  of
       asylum rather than private and family life claims, was material  that
       was so incompatible with  the  Home  Office's  stated  case  that  it
       demanded disclosure to the First-tier Tribunal. I accept that had  it
       been available to the Judge below, it might have given rise to a more
       detailed examination of the question of insurmountable obstacles. But
       it is simply not the kind of material to which there is only a single
       response in the Appellant's favour, such that it should be allowed to
       undermine the otherwise lawful approach of a  Judge  whose  attention
       was not directed towards it.


   28. Mr Turner also argued that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to give
       sufficient weight to those  factors  of  the  couple's  circumstances
       where it had made favourable findings. As noted in  R  (Iran)  [2005]
       EWCA Civ 982 ï¿½20, within the appellate system allegations  of  errors
       in assessing proportionality must be identified via  the  traditional
       public law errors (contrary to the approach taken when reviewing  the
       proportionality  of  government  decision  making  directly,  as   on
       judicial review). So strictly speaking, criticisms based on  "weight"
       alone have no purchase in a statutory appeal.

   29. In any event, the positive features of the case were essentially that
       the relationship was a genuine and subsisting one. However, the Judge
       considered that the Appellant's residence in the UK  was  precarious,
       unsurprisingly  given  his  failure  to  seek   to   regularise   his
       application via an application on "durable relationship" grounds once
       Ms Tkadleckova had stopped exercising Treaty Rights in the UK. So the
       positive findings on the genuineness of the relationship  essentially
       amounted to the entry point to qualify for consideration  of  whether
       the couple faced insurmountable obstacles, which  is  the  test  both
       under the Rules and outside them too for a couple  without  children,
       see Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.

   30. The Judge was clearly aware that the Appellant would  have  a  strong
       case under the Immigration Rules to return to the UK - that  was  the
       premise which activated his consideration of the  Chikwamba  line  of
       authority. However, as recognised in one of the case he cited,  Hayat
       [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 ï¿½[30](b): "Where Article 8 is engaged,  it  will
       be a disproportionate interference with family  or  private  life  to
       enforce such a policy unless, to use the  language  of  Sullivan  LJ,
       there is a sensible reason for doing so." Given the findings  of  the
       Tribunal below as to the Appellant's  disingenuous  stance  vis-ï¿½-vis
       his residence rights under European Union law, it seems  to  me  that
       the conclusion that there was indeed such a "sensible reason" present
       here was one to which the Judge was perfectly entitled to come.

   31. Mr Turner did not direct my attention to any evidence that was before
       the First-tier Tribunal that would have shown the Appellant  to  face
       problems in Bangladesh because he had changed his name by deed  poll.
       Once again, this is essentially unevidenced speculation based  on  an
       invitation to assume that life in Bangladesh would be very harsh when
       contrasted with that in the UK. Doubtless there would be differences,
       leading to inconvenience and perhaps some degree of hardship.  But  I
       can see nothing that should have driven the Judge below  to  conclude
       that any such difficulties would reach the "insurmountable obstacles"
       threshold. One might equally well speculate that mixed  race  couples
       often relocate successfully to  one  of  their  respective  homelands
       notwithstanding the potential difficulties they face. But the  burden
       of proof is on the Appellant to make his case.

   32. In conclusion, I do not consider that the grounds of appeal are  made
       out. The First-tier Tribunal decision is not flawed by  any  material
       of law, and accordingly stands.

Decision:

    The appeal is dismissed.


Signed:                                            Date: 8 October 2018
