                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Aujla promulgated on the 27th June 2016,  in  which  he
      dismissed the Appellant's asylum appeal.

   2. The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan who was  born  on  the  15th
      March 1991.  Within the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Aujla,
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge summarised the Appellant's case  in  the
      following manner:

          "17.   The Appellant was employed by the Qalandar Khail Clinic as
          a security guard gatekeeper, having obtained this job  through  a
          doctor in his village.  He worked there for 5/6 days  before  his
          problems began.  On  1st  November  2014,  two  Taliban  soldiers
          arrived at the clinic in a doctor's car.   The  Appellant  opened
          the door to allow them in.  Approximately 15 minutes  later,  the
          police arrived at the clinic and began shooting  at  the  Taliban
          members.  The Appellant fled the scene when  the  fighting  began
          and ran home.  The same night the Appellant received a  telephone
          call from his cousin Khalid to warn him that he  had  heard  that
          the Taliban believed that the Appellant had been involved in  the
          incident and  that  he  had  informed  the  police  that  Taliban
          fighters were  being  treated  at  the  clinic.   He  warned  the
          Appellant that the Taliban were looking for him.

          18.    The Appellant then travelled to his uncle's house  in  the
          neighbouring village of Nasro Qala.  The following  morning,  his
          father informed him that the Taliban had visited his family  home
          searching for him and warned his family that the  Appellant  were
          to present himself to  the  Taliban.   They  also  presented  the
          family with a letter confirming that.  The  Appellant  then  left
          Afghanistan and travelled to Haji Camp in Pakistan  with  another
          uncle who was visiting the country on holiday.  Whilst he was  in
          Pakistan the Appellant learned that the Taliban had  visited  his
          family home on a number of occasions.   They  had  kidnapped  and
          later killed his brother Faridullah.  His body  was  returned  to
          his parents' family  home  between  10  and  12  days  after  the
          Appellant had left Afghanistan and travelled to Pakistan.".

   3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted at [22] that  the  Respondent  had
      stated in paragraph 27 of the  refusal  notice  that  the  Appellant's
      account of his experiences had been accepted and that it had also been
      accepted that his family were subsequently threatened, his brother was
      kidnapped and killed and a number of threatening letters were sent  to
      the family.  He said that it was further accepted that  the  Appellant
      had demonstrated a genuine subjective fear on return to his home area,
      but it was said that within the  refusal  letter  the  Respondent  had
      considered that the fear  was  not  objectively  well-founded  because
      there was sufficient protection available to the  Appellant  from  the
      authorities in Afghanistan and it was not accepted  that  the  Taliban
      would still have any adverse interest in him and  that  the  Appellant
      could safely relocate within Afghanistan.

   4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Aujla at [27] reminded himself that the only
      issue before him was whether or not the Appellant  could  relocate  to
      Kabul and whether there was a sufficiency of protection  available  to
      him.  The Judge went on to find at [29] that "The Appellant is not  in
      fear of the authorities on account of actual or imputed  opinion.   He
      is not seen as a member or supporter of the  Taliban.   Therefore,  as
      the Appellant is not wanted by the authorities, subject to  the  other
      criteria, the option of internal relocation to Kabul is  available  to
      him.".  The Judge went on to find at [31] that the Appellant  did  not
      have an anti-Taliban profile and he was working as  a  security  guard
      outside a clinic and suspected by the Taliban of informing the police,
      which gave rise to the shooting at the clinic  and  that  the  Taliban
      suspected him of having informed the authorities and  started  looking
      for him. He found that having not located the Appellant,  the  Taliban
      kidnapped his brother and then killed him.  The Judge found that  "the
      Taliban had therefore, to some extent, already taken  revenge  against
      the Appellant by kidnapping and killing a close member of his  family"
      at [31].

   5. The Judge went on to find that:

          "32.   The expert stated on page 17 of the report  that  for  the
          Taliban to target someone there was no need for  a  profile.   He
          stated  that  the  Taliban  had   killed   labourers,   cleaners,
          gardeners, chefs and watchmen who had  worked  for  the  foreign,
          civilian or  military  projects  in  Afghanistan.   However,  the
          Appellant's circumstances could not be equated with anyone in any
          of those categories.  The Appellant worked for a  local  civilian
          hospital for a few days.  An incident happened  as  a  result  of
          which the Taliban believed he had informed on them.  The incident
          happened well away from Kabul.

          33.    The Appellant is a 25-year-old young man.  He is  fit  and
          well.  He had family in Afghanistan whose assistance he can  rely
          upon in settling in Kabul.  The incident that he was involved  in
          was a one-off incident which happened nearly 2 years ago.   There
          is no reason to suggest that the Appellant would not be  able  to
          access a sufficiency of protection from the  authorities  in  the
          capital.  I reject the expert's generalised conclusions that  the
          Appellant would be viewed  by  suspicion  and  distrust  by  non-
          Pashtuns in Kabul and therefore he would be at  a  serious  risk.
          There must be hundreds if not thousands  of  Pashtuns  living  in
          Kabul.  There is no reason to suggest that  the  Appellant  would
          stick out as someone who could be wanted by the  Taliban.   There
          must be hundreds if not thousands of Pashtuns who  moved  to  the
          capital from rural areas to make a living there,  just  like  any
          other big city in any country.  Furthermore, I do  not  find  the
          Taliban would have the interest and resources to  put  in  motion
          specific efforts to trace the Appellant.

          33.    Having considered the evidence presented to me,  I  accept
          the Appellant may  still  be  at  risk  of  persecution  and  ill
          treatment at the hands of the Taliban if he returned to his  home
          area.  However, I find that the option of internal relocation  to
          Kabul is open to the Appellant, where he should be able to access
          the sufficiency of protection from the authorities.  It would  be
          reasonable to expect the Appellant to relocate to  Kabul  in  the
          circumstances.   I  therefore  find   the   Appellant   has   not
          established, on the lower standard of proof, that he had a  well-
          founded fear of persecution for a 1951 convention reason,  if  he
          were returned to Afghanistan.".

      The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  therefore  dismissed  the  Appellant's
      asylum claim.

   6. The Appellant has now sought to appeal against that decision  for  the
      reasons set out within the Grounds of Appeal.  This again is a  matter
      of record and is therefore not repeated in full here, but in  summary,
      it is argued by the Appellant that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  has
      not considered the opinion of the expert as set out within the  expert
      report properly.  It is said within the Grounds  of  Appeal  that  the
      expert made it clear why and how the Appellant would be at  risk  from
      the Taliban in Kabul and that the Judge rejected the expert's  opinion
      without good reason. It is argued that the expert had  also  mentioned
      how the Appellant could be found between the  Pashtuns  in  Kabul  and
      that the Respondent had not produced any counter-evidence.

   7. It is further argued that the Judge arguably erred in law in  ignoring
      the decision of the Upper Tribunal in the case  of  Sahibladah  v  The
      Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [AA/03421/2014]  and  the
      Tribunal Judge's decision  in  that  case  that  Kabul  could  not  be
      considered a safe option  considering  the  expert  evidence.   It  is
      further argued that the Judge erred in finding that the Appellant  was
      not wanted by the authorities,  when  the  Appellant  had  produced  a
      letter from the security headquarters Parwan Province Crime Department
      dated the 4th November 2014 which was included within the bundle.   It
      was argued that the Judge erred in finding that  relocation  to  Kabul
      was open and reasonable when the Appellant did not have family support
      and further it was argued that the Judge erred  in  finding  that  the
      Appellant's circumstances  could  not  be  equated  with  any  of  the
      categories in mentioned paragraph 17 when the Appellant was working as
      a guard at the clinic which was accepted by the Respondent.

   8.   It  was  further  argued  that  the  Judge  erred  in  finding  that
      sufficiency of protection would be available when  the  expert  report
      had  considered  why  and  how  sufficient  protection  would  not  be
      available.  It was further argued that  the  Appellant  only  lived  1
      hour, or 55 kilometres  away  from  Kabul,  and  that  the  Judge  had
      therefore erred in finding that the Appellant could relocate , when he
      found that the Appellant would be at risk in his home  area  and  just
      did not have proper regard to  the  expert  report.   It  was  further
      argued that the Judge had failed to deal with the Appellant's  Article
      8 Human Rights case in respect of his relationship  with  his  British
      fianc�.

   9. Permission to appeal has been granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Heynes on the 21st July 2016. He found that the documents stating that
      the Appellant was wanted by the authorities did not form part  of  the
      original claim , but arose from the documents within  the  Appellant's
      bundle and that therefore this was not part of the claim that had been
      accepted by the Respondent, and no presenting officer was  present  at
      the appeal hearing.  However, Judge Heynes found that it was  arguable
      that  the  Judge  although  mentioning  the  expert  report,  had  not
      adequately dealt with it and  not  given  reasons  for  rejecting  its
      contents, which he found amounted to an arguable error of law.

  10. Within the Rule 24 Reply dated the 1st September 2016, it is argued by
      the Respondent that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  properly  directed
      himself and that the Appellant's reliance upon an unreported  case  in
      the form of the case of Sahibladah was erroneous as the  Tribunal  had
      not given permission for reliance upon  an  unreported  case.   It  is
      argued that the Judge considered the evidence in  the  round  together
      with the contents of the expert report as identified at  paragraph  27
      of the judgement.  It is said that the Appellant's complaint that  the
      findings  at  paragraph  32  were  contradictory  on  account  of  the
      Appellant having worked as a security guard was without merit and that
      the grounds failed to recognised the report required the employment to
      be for a foreign, civilian or military project and that it was open to
      the Judge to find that the Appellant did not  fall  into  one  of  the
      categories of a person with a high profile who would  be  at  risk  in
      Kabul.  It is said that there  is  nothing  in  the  determination  to
      suggest that the contents of the report were  rejected  and  that  the
      findings  of  the  Judge  were  compliant  with  the  expert  report's
      contents.

  11. In his oral submissions to the Tribunal,  Mr  Iqbal  argued  that  the
      Judge had not given adequate reasons for disagreeing with  the  expert
      report.  He said that the expert report was not a generic report,  but
      was subjective to the risk faced by this Appellant and that  the  only
      reason given by the expert was at paragraph 33, when he said  that  he
      rejected the generalised  conclusions  that  the  Appellant  would  be
      viewed with suspicion and  distrust  by  non-Pashtuns  in  Kabul.   He
      argued  that  the  Judge's  findings  regarding  which  category   the
      Appellant fitted into at paragraph 32 were  irrelevant,  when  it  had
      been accepted by the Respondent that the Appellant had  been  targeted
      by the Taliban.  He argued that  although  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Aujla is a very experienced Judge, on this occasion he had  failed  to
      deal adequately with the expert opinion. He submitted that there was a
      letter at pages 48 and 49 of the bundle from the state authorities  in
      Afghanistan saying  the  Appellant  should  "attend  at  the  security
      headquarters in Bagram District". Mr Iqbal confirmed that he  was  not
      arguing that the Appellant was actually wanted by the authorities, but
      said that the letter from the authorities was a relevant part  of  the
      background. He further argued that the Judge had not  dealt  with  the
      Country Guidance cases adequately.

  12. Miss Fijiwala on behalf of  the  Respondent  argued  that  the  County
      Guidance case of HN had said that  the  situation  in  Kabul  was  not
      deteriorating and that the previous County Guidance  case  of  AK  was
      still relevant in respect of relocation to Kabul.  She argued that the
      Judge had properly considered the expert report and that there was  no
      material error.  She argued that the Appellant was a  simple  civilian
      and the Judge had properly found that the Appellant although  at  risk
      in his home area could safely relocate to Kabul and that  there  would
      be adequacy of protection.  She argued the incident occurred far  away
      from Kabul.  She further argued that the expert evidence was dated and
      historic and that although the Judge had not specifically  dealt  with
      the risk of recruitment referred to by the expert at page 72, she said
      that this was not a material error and that the weight to be  attached
      to the report was a matter for the Judge.

  13. Miss Fijiwala further argued that although the Article 8 claim had not
      been considered by the Judge, within the refusal letter  it  was  said
      that the Appellant had not cohabited with his partner for 2 years  and
      the partner had not attended as a  result  of  what  was  said  to  be
      illness, but she argued that the same decision would have been reached
      by the Judge, in rejecting the claim even if he had considered Article
      8 on the evidence before him and that any failure in that  regard  was
      not material.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

  14. It was relevant in this case that the Respondent had already  accepted
      the Appellant's account as to what happened to him in Afghanistan,  in
      terms of the fact that he had worked as a security guard at the clinic
      and that after the arrival of the members of  the  Taliban,  that  the
      police arrived at the clinic and that  shooting  began  and  that  the
      Taliban had been around to the Appellant's home searching for him  and
      had warned his family that the Appellant should present himself to the
      Taliban and that not only had the Taliban visited his home on a number
      of occasions, but they had kidnapped and killed his brother.   It  was
      against that background that the Judge was assessing  the  ability  of
      the Appellant to safely internally relocate to Kabul and the  adequacy
      of protection that could be provided to him by the Afghan authorities.



  15. The expert report in the case from Mr Jawad  Zadeh  was  to  be  found
      between pages 54 and 82 inclusive of the Appellant's bundle,  and  ran
      to some 28 pages.  Within that report the expert at  page  70  of  the
      Appellant's bundle had stated  in  giving  evidence  as  to  how  once
      present in Afghanistan, the Taliban would be able to track down  Mr  W
      with ease and how Kabul  Province  held  fragmented  communities  with
      districts that are populated by the Hazara, and districts populated by
      the Pashtuns.  He stated that there were very few mixed  areas  within
      the north  of  Kabul  and  central  Kabul  and  that  mixed  areas  in
      Afghanistan are not diverse areas.  It was stated that  the  north  of
      Kabul is where the affluent Tajiks and Uzbecks reside and that central
      Kabul was where the  majority  of  foreign  embassies  and  government
      ministries were located and that  some  of  the  warlords  resided  in
      central Kabul guards offices and houses with dozens of  heavily  armed
      guards. The expert stated that for Mr W to move to Kabul he would have
      to move to a place where there was an  establish  Pashtun  communities
      and that the Pashtuns use their Mosque as their community  hubs.   The
      expert stated that Mr W would not be able to avoid meeting Pashtun men
      in a Mosque a few times each day.   He  further  stated  that  Taliban
      members often appear like a  quotidian  citizen  in  public  and  that
      Taliban who are not armed can walk into any shop,  Mosque  and  market
      and go about their daily lives.  They can appear like a street vendor,
      taxi driver, a customer or shopkeeper, a beggar or a  passer-by.   The
      expert stated that the Taliban do not ply in the west of  Kabul  where
      approximately 1 million Hazara Shia Muslims reside and the expert went
      on to state that a Pashtun who takes revenge is seen  in  high  esteem
      and a person who does not take revenge  will  be  seen  as  a  coward,
      unmanly and not worthy of respect or trust in marriage  and  business.
      He stated that the Taliban members would seek to take revenge and that
      if the Taliban believe that the Appellant  had  been  a  spy  for  the
      Afghan government then his own life would be taken in revenge for  the
      Taliban members who were killed in the Afghan government raid and that
      the brothers and cousins of the slain Taliban members in the  hospital
      would also be bound by the Pashtunwali code, in regard to  honour  and
      valour, whereby these can be  restored  if  revenge  was  taken.   The
      expert had further stated that Mr W is a Pashtun from the Niazi  tribe
      and that in Afghanistan the majority of Pashtuns use the name of their
      tribe as a surname and that  Pashtuns  have  several  distinct  Pashtu
      accents.  The expert had further gone on to consider how even  if  the
      Appellant did return to Kabul even if the Taliban members who knew  Mr
      W could not locate  him,  he  may  still  remain  at  risk  of  forced
      recruitment by other Taliban groups.

  16. In this regard, I consider, that although a  very  experienced  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge, on this occasion, First-tier Tribunal Judge Aujla
      has not properly and adequately assessed the expert's report in coming
      to his conclusion that the Appellant would not be at risk upon  return
      to Kabul.  Although he states at paragraph 27 that he had  taken  into
      account the expert  report  and  in  particular  what  was  stated  in
      paragraph 17 and the conclusions on page 21, the Judge's  analysis  of
      the evidence at paragraph 33 was simply limited to his statement  that
      "I reject the expert's generalised conclusion that the Appellant would
      be viewed by suspicion and  distrust  by  non-Pashtuns  in  Kabul  and
      therefore he would be at serious risk.  There must be hundreds if  not
      thousands of Pashtuns living in Kabul.  There is no reason to  suggest
      that the Appellant would stick out as someone who could be  wanted  by
      the Taliban.  There must be hundreds if not thousands of Pashtuns  who
      move to the city from rural areas to make a living  there,  just  like
      any other big city in any country.  Furthermore I do not find that the
      Taliban would have  the  interest  and  resources  to  put  in  motion
      specific efforts to trace the Appellant.".

  17. However, in this regard, the Judge has not adequately  considered  how
      the Appellant could be identified as being  from  a  particular  tribe
      from his surname and also from his  accent,  and  has  not  adequately
      considered the expert evidence regarding the Taliban influence in  the
      areas of Kabul where the Appellant would be likely to reside  and  the
      risk that he may face as a result.  Further, the Judge appears to have
      relied upon the fact that the incident was  a  one-off  incident  that
      happened nearly 2 years ago at [33], but again in this regard has  not
      adequately considered the expert evidence that the family  members  of
      the Taliban who were killed in the incident would  be  bound  to  take
      revenge under their code of honour.

  18.  Further, the Judge appears to have wrongly relied upon  the  comments
      from the expert at page 17 that  the  Taliban  had  killed  labourers,
      cleaners, gardeners, chefs and watchmen that had worked  for  foreign,
      civilian or military projects in Afghanistan but from the  Appellant's
      circumstances he could not be equated with anyone in those categories.
       The Judge found that the Appellant  had  simply  worked  as  a  local
      civilian at a civilian hospital for a few days.   However,  the  point
      being made by the expert was that there was no need for a profile  for
      the Taliban to target someone, not that they needed to fall  within  a
      particular profile.  The Judge's reasoning in that regard, appears  to
      be a misreading of the expert report, in  presuming  that  the  expert
      required that someone would need to fall  within  a  certain  category
      before they would be at risk.  The expert stated specifically  someone
      did not need a profile. The Respondent had already accepted  that  the
      Appellant had previously been targeted and  accepted  his  version  of
      events.  This amounts to material error of  law,  in  that  the  Judge
      appears to have misinterpreted the expert report in this regard.

  19. Further, the Judge's  findings  that  having  killed  the  Appellant's
      brother, the Taliban had thereby to some extent already taken  revenge
      against the Appellant at [31] again, does not adequately consider  the
      expert evidence in that regard, that notwithstanding the  Taliban  had
      murdered his brother, the Appellant  in  the  expert's  opinion  would
      still personally be at risk.

  20. In my judgement, the failure of the Judge to fully and adequately deal
      with the expert report, does amount to a material error of law, as  it
      cannot be said that the decision of the Judge would necessarily be the
      same, had he fully and adequately dealt with that  expert  report  and
      considered the entire contents of the report, rather than  just  parts
      of it.

  21. Further, the Judge's findings regarding sufficiency of  protection  at
      [34] does not involve any analysis of any evidence  before  the  Judge
      came to his conclusion that there would be sufficiency  of  protection
      from the authorities in Kabul.

  22. Although the Grounds of Appeal make reference to  the  fact  that  the
      Judge failed to consider what is clearly an unreported case and  which
      was not a Country Guidance case, the Judge clearly would not be  bound
      to consider an unreported case which would not be binding upon him.

  23. Further, I find that the Judge has not dealt with the Article 8 claim,
      and it was clearly part of the Appellant's case before the  First-tier
      Tribunal  Judge  that  the  Appellant  did  have  fianc�  in  the  UK.
      Consideration should therefore have been given to that Article 8 case.
       This also amounts to an error of law.

  24. However, the Judge's failure to deal with the expert report adequately
      and failing to give sufficiently adequate reasons for  rejecting  that
      expert report and for his findings that  the  Appellant  could  safely
      internally relocate and would  have  adequacy  of  protection  in  the
      failure to consider the Article 8 claim, do mean that the decision  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Aujla does contain material  errors  of  law
      and is set aside.

Notice of Decision

The decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Aujla  does  contain  material
errors of law and is set aside.  The case is remitted  back  to  the  First-
tier Tribunal for rehearing, before  any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other
than First-tier Tribunal Judge Aujla.

The Appellant was granted anonymity at the First-tier,  and  I  consider  it
appropriate for that anonymity direction to continue.   Unless  or  until  a
Court or a Tribunal  orders  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is  hereby  granted
anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall refer to the  Appellant  or
any member of his family either directly or indirectly.  Failure  to  comply
with this direction may lead to contempt of court proceedings.
