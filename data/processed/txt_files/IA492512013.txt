Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Lane instructed by Rotherham & Co
For the Respondent:    Mrs K Heath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 9th December  1972.   She
    appealed against the Respondent's decision dated 7th November  2013  to
    issue removal directions under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum
    Act 1999 and to refuse further leave to remain on private life  grounds
    under Article 8.  Her appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Hawden-Beal on 19th March 2014.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted in the First-tier  Tribunal  by  Judge
    McDade on 29th April 2014.  Permission was granted on  the  basis  that
    Judge McDade considered it  arguable  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had
    failed to deal with the Immigration Rules and Article 8 in the light of
    the law that applied at the date of  application,  namely  23rd  August
    2011, but instead considered the matter as if the application had  been
    made on or after 9th July 2012.

 3. The Respondent's representative filed a Rule 24 response  on  16th  May
    2014.   The  response  argues  that   the   Appellant's   grounds   are
    disingenuous and misleading to the extent that her Article 8 claim does
    not fall for consideration under the old Immigration Rules.  An extract
    from the Respondent's refusal letter is then quoted which  sets  out  a
    chronology concluding with a letter from the Appellant dated 18th March
    2013 requesting a reconsideration of her case.  It is then stated  that
    having requested reconsideration the Appellant failed  to  comply  with
    her reporting conditions and the decision under appeal is in respect of
    her application for reconsideration dated 18th March 2013, which  would
    bring her appeal squarely under the new Immigration Rules  relating  to
    Article 8.  In those circumstances it is submitted that the  First-tier
    Judge made no arguable error of law.

 4. Thus the matter came before me in the Upper  Tribunal  on  18th  August
    2014.  The Appellant was present and representation  was  as  mentioned
    above.

 5. For the Appellant, Mr Lane submitted that there were three reasons  why
    the First-tier Judge had  erred  in  law  in  her  decision.   Mr  Lane
    submitted that the decision under appeal is  dated  7th  November  2013
    (which is accepted) and the application was made  when  the  old  Rules
    were in force.  Therefore, the First-tier Judge was wrong to  refer  to
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the current Rules.  The application
    should have been considered in accordance  with  established  case  law
    such  as  Huang  and  Razgar.   The  error  was  material  because  the
    Appellant's case is based on her relationship with her aunt and uncle.

 6. Secondly, Mr Lane  submitted  that  even  if  the  matter  were  to  be
    considered under the new Rules there had been no Article 8  assessment.
    Thirdly, Article 8 should have been considered on a "standalone" basis.



 7. For the Respondent, Mrs Heath relied upon the Rule 24 response to which
    I have already referred.  She pointed out that the Appellant has  still
    not been in the UK  for  fourteen  years  and  therefore  there  is  no
    material error of law in the  determination.   Mrs  Heath  referred  to
    paragraph 19 of the determination and submitted that the guidance given
    by the Upper Tribunal in Gulshan had  been  followed  correctly.   Even
    after the decision in MM Gulshan  remains  good  law.   The  First-tier
    Judge had made a detailed summary of the  evidence  from  paragraph  14
    onwards and at paragraph 19 had correctly  applied  the  relevant  law,
    including the guidance given in Gulshan.

 8. I am satisfied for  the  following  reasons  that  the  Respondent  was
    correct in considering the original application against Appendix FM and
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.   The  Respondent's  reasons
    for refusal letter states that on 1st February 2011 the  Appellant  was
    served with a notice advising her of her liability to removal.  On 10th
    May 2011 she submitted an application for further leave to remain which
    was refused with no right of appeal on 7th July 2011.  On  18th  August
    the Appellant requested a reconsideration and she then failed to report
    to East Midlands Reporting Centre on  24th  August  and  7th  September
    2011.  She was then sent a letter on 8th September 2011  reminding  her
    of her obligation to report as per  the  conditions  of  her  temporary
    admission.  A letter was then received from the Appellant on 18th March
    2013 requesting a  reconsideration  of  her  case.   That  request  was
    refused on 7th November 2013,  which  is  the  decision  under  appeal.
    Therefore, the Respondent was correct to apply the amended  version  of
    the Immigration Rules which came into force on 9th July 2012.

 9. The Respondent's reasons for refusal point out that the Appellant  came
    to the United Kingdom as a visitor in  2003,  was  given  an  extension
    until 2004 and had been an overstayer ever since.  She was noted to  be
    an absconder when she failed to maintain  her  reporting  condition  in
    2011.  There is no category within Appendix FM which  would  cover  the
    Appellant's relationship with her  aunt  and  extended  family  members
    unless she came to the UK in a dependent relative capacity and remained
    within that  category.   The  refusal  letter  also  explains  why  the
    Appellant failed to qualify under paragraph 276ADE.

10. The First-tier Judge found that the  material  facts  relevant  to  the
    appeal were that, at the date of decision, the Appellant was  a  single
    woman aged 40, who had applied for leave to remain in the  UK  to  help
    care for her aunt.  She lived with her aunt and her aunt's husband  and
    they gave her ï¿½150 per month for  her  personal  needs.   Applying  the
    relevant law to the established facts, the First-tier Judge found  that
    the Appellant could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM in respect
    of her family life or the requirements of paragraph 276ADE  in  respect
    of her private life, and that the Appellant and her representatives had
    conceded as much by making an application for leave to  remain  outside
    the Rules.  Therefore, following Gulshan, that should be the end of the
    matter unless there were arguably good grounds for going on to consider
    for Article 8 purposes whether there are compelling  circumstances  not
    sufficiently recognised under them.  This is dealt with at paragraph 19
    of the determination.  At paragraph 20 the First-tier Judge refers to a
    letter dated February 2014 from the  aunt's  consultant  physician  who
    confirms that, without the Appellant's help, the  aunt  would  have  to
    have a care package funded by Social Services.  A  grant  of  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules to save Social Services from having to pay for
    care for the aunt is not, the judge found, a reason to grant  leave  to
    remain outside the Rules.  The Appellant had known since 2004 that  she
    should not be in the UK and was told clearly that her last extension of
    leave was only to enable her to make alternative arrangements  for  her
    aunt's care.  The judge found that the Appellant had done nothing about
    that and had overstayed by ten years.

11. The First-tier Judge concluded that it would not be unjustifiably harsh
    for the  Appellant  to  return  to  Jamaica  or  that  there  were  any
    insurmountable obstacles in her way  to  prevent  her  from  doing  so.
    There was nothing particular  to  the  Appellant's  case  which  merits
    consideration of her Article 8 rights outside of the Immigration Rules.

12. I am satisfied that the judge's self  directions  as  to  the  law  are
    correct.  She has made findings which were clearly open to her  on  the
    evidence and which are supported by cogent reasons.  The  determination
    contains no material error of law.



DECISION

The making of the decision by the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error on a point of law.  I  uphold  the  determination
and dismiss the appeal.
