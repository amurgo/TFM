                            DECISION AND REASONS


      1. By a decision dated 17 March 2020 the Upper Tribunal set aside  the
         determination of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  on  the  basis  of  an
         accepted error of law. Directions were given for a remote rehearing
         of the matter and the Upper Tribunal is grateful to the parties for
         the flexibility of approach and  assistance  rendered  in  enabling
         this matter to proceed as a remote audio hearing. In particular for
         the manner in which the advocates have cooperated with  each  other
         and with the Tribunal to facilitate the exchange  of  evidence  and
         pleadings in an accessible manner ensuring the hearing was able  to
         proceed.


Background


      2. The Upper Tribunal found that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  findings
         relating to the nationality, date of  birth,  immigration  history,
         family  circumstances  and  health-related  issues  concerning  the
         appellant's wife shall be preserved findings.
      3. It was also recorded by the First-Tier Tribunal that  in  light  of
         further evidence provided by the appellant  it  was  no  longer  in
         dispute that the financial requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
         could be met. This too is a preserved finding.
      4. The two issues that remain at large relate  to  paragraphs  320(11)
         and S-EC.1.5 of the Immigration Rules.
      5. The appellant was  born  in  Pakistan  on  18  September  1974.  He
         initially entered the United Kingdom lawfully as a visitor in 2002.
         The appellant overstayed and applied for further leave to remain as
         a work permit holder on 8 December 2003 which was refused.
      6. The appellant met his wife, [Ms K], in 2009. She had  two  children
         from an earlier marriage and was separated but made  it  clear  she
         did not want a relationship for the sake of her children.  At  this
         time, the appellant was in a short-term relationship with  a  Czech
         national.
      7. In 2011 the appellant was introduced to [Ms  K]'s  children.  On  4
         September 2011 they undertook an Islamic marriage after  which  the
         appellant moved in with his new wife and her children. [Ms  K]  was
         granted a divorce from her first husband on  7  June  2012  in  the
         English courts.
      8. The appellant states he became very close to the  children,  became
         involved  in  their  lives,  including  helping  them  with   their
         schoolwork.
      9. On 12 March 2014, the appellant and [Ms K] married under UK law.
     10. The appellant's wife suffers health issues, detailed below, and the
         appellant claims to have provided support and  help  to  her  as  a
         result. The appellant's wife has, however,  continued  to  work  at
         Tesco. It is claimed they have been a supportive employer providing
         light duties and limited hours which she is able to cope with.
     11. The appellant states that whilst in the United Kingdom  he  applied
         on two occasions for permission to  remain  on  the  basis  of  the
         marriage. The applications were refused as the  appellant  did  not
         have status to remain, even though the  marriage  was  accepted  as
         being genuine.
     12. The appellant states he realised he should  have  left  the  United
         Kingdom to make an application to return which was suggested in  an
         earlier refusal and upholding of that refusal on appeal, but he did
         not for which he apologised.
     13. On 1 September 2018, the appellant  was  arrested  at  a  hotel  in
         London accused of working without permission. The appellant  claims
         he decided he did not wish to fight to remain anymore and therefore
         arranged  to  pay  for  his  own  ticket  and  requested  voluntary
         departure back to Pakistan from where he made  an  application  for
         entry clearance to return to the United Kingdom.
     14. The appellant states that since being in Pakistan he  speaks  every
         day to his wife and stepchildren.
     15. The appellant's wife  confirms  his  history  of  the  relationship
         adding in her own statement that as a result of a car  accident  in
         2009 she was injured and in 2011 began to suffer severe back  pain.
         An MRI scan later diagnosed bulging discs  that  were  causing  the
         pain, but she is unable to have surgery as a  result  of  potential
         complications. In 2007 Carpel Tunnel and De Quervains Tenosynovitis
         was diagnosed making work difficult. The appellant's wife has  more
         recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia.
     16. It is stated as a result of the difficulties the appellant has been
         "a huge part" of his wife's life  and  supported  her  through  the
         health problems as well as being a father to her son and daughter.
     17. [Ms K] states she realised her husband did not have status  in  the
         UK when she met him although they tried to  regularise  his  status
         having  made  two  applications  based  on  marriage,  which   were
         unsuccessful.
     18. Statements have also been provided by Mr [SK], the adult son of [Ms
         K], confirming the  chronology  of  the  relationship  between  the
         appellant and his mother. It is said the appellant 'looked out' for
         the whole family, cooking for them to make sure they had  food  and
         supporting them in their education especially at times  when  their
         mother was bedbound due to her chronic back problems.
     19. [SK] confirms the financial support he provides for the  family  as
         well as the more practical support given, adding at [15  -  16]  of
         his witness statement of 3 October 2019:

             "15.     When Zeeshan came into our life we were rewarded with
                  a father and a close friend  due  to  not  having  a  good
                  relationship with my biological father.


             16.  It has been over a year now since he has been in Pakistan
                  and life isn't the same without him."

     20. Witness statements have also  been  provided  by  [FK],  the  adult
         daughter of [Ms K], confirming the chronology and the  support  she
         received from the appellant in relation to  practical  care  and  a
         specific connection with her education, including at  undergraduate
         level.  The statement notes her mother has been very happy with the
         appellant and that she wishes that he could return.
     21. A further statement from [HK], the wife  of  [SK],  has  also  been
         provided dated 3 October 2019. This confirms that  all  the  family
         live in the same property in High  Wycombe  where  they  contribute
         towards the family expenses. This witness is employed as  a  Higher
         Executive Officer  in  the  Department  for  Business,  Energy  and
         Industrial Strategy in London.
     22. [HK] speaks of the support and assistance provided to  her  by  the
         appellant even before she arrived in the United  Kingdom,  when  he
         stayed in touch with her to prepare her for  the  culture  she  was
         about to face. The appellant provided support during the  time  she
         moved to and settled in the United Kingdom, in connection with  her
         own education achievements, and subsequent application for securing
         employment with the civil service under their graduate programme.
     23. At [9 - 15] this witness writes:

             "9.  In the two years we spent together, we  have  had  dinner
                  together every single night as a family, have travelled  a
                  lot - been to Wales, Cornwall and Scotland together,  have
                  celebrated birthdays and  anniversaries,  attended  family
                  occasions together like any other normal family  does  and
                  therefore it cannot be denied that he is an important part
                  of not only our family but my life.


             10.  I have been deeply involved  with  his  immigration  case
                  since 2016 as I do not want to lose him as a father figure
                  and someone I can always meet up to discuss any issues and
                  rely upon.


             11.  I have not only travelled to the detention  centre  every
                  other day to visit him after work but I have also been  to
                  the legal representatives dealing with  his  case  in  the
                  last 3 years and I have been to  his  court  hearing  last
                  year with him which shows how much he means to me.


             12.  I also visited Pakistan in August to see him.


             13.   His  voluntary  departure  has  massively  impacted   me
                  emotionally and I am still struggling to cope with it.


             14.  I try to stay in touch with him as much as I can and make
                  sure I share my life details with him.


             15.  I wish and hope that he will be with us soon  so  we  can
                  resume living like a complete family."

     24. The application for  entry  clearance  made  on  9  December  2018,
         following the  appellant's  voluntary  departure  from  the  United
         Kingdom, is under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules on the basis
         of his family life with his partner [Ms K] and  stepchildren.  This
         was refused on 22 February 2019.
     25. Pursuant to paragraph 320(11) the decision maker writes:

             "You  have  previously  breached  the  Immigration  Rules   by
             overstaying for a period in excess of  14  years.  I  am  also
             satisfied that there are  aggravating  circumstances  in  your
             case,  in  that  you  were  encountered  taking   unauthorised
             employment. Furthermore, you  did  not  make  any  attempt  to
             regularise your stay until 2013.


             I am  satisfied  that  your  actions  demonstrate  a  flagrant
             disregard for the Immigration Rules spanning over a decade.  I
             am therefore satisfied that you have previously contrived in a
             significant way to frustrate the intentions of the Immigration
             Rules. I am therefore refusing your application in  accordance
             with paragraph 320(11) of the Immigration Rules. This decision
             has been authorised by an Entry Clearance Manager. In reaching
             this decision, I confirm that I have exercised  my  discretion
             but for the reasons  outlined  above  I  am  not  prepared  to
             exercise discretion in your favour."

     26. In relation to the suitability aspects the decision maker writes:

             "Under paragraph EC - P.1.1.(c)  your  application  falls  for
             refusal on  grounds  of  suitability  under  Section  S-EC  of
             Appendix FM.


             The Immigration Rules state:


             S-EC.1.5. The exclusion  of  the  applicant  from  the  UK  is
             conducive  to  the  public  good  because,  for  example,  the
             applicant's conduct (including convictions which do  not  fall
             within paragraph S-EC.1.4.), character, associations, or other
             reasons, make it undesirable to grant them entry clearance."

     27. The reason it is said S-EC.1.5.  is  applicable  is  for  the  same
         reasons it is said paragraph 320(11) is engaged.
     28. As noted above, the refusal pursuant to the  Eligibility  financial
         requirements is no longer an issue. Eligibility in relation to  the
         English language requirement is also met.
     29. In relation to whether exceptional circumstances exist the decision
         maker writes:

             "We have considered, under paragraphs GEN.3.1. and GEN.3.2  of
             Appendix FM  as  applicable,  whether  there  are  exceptional
             circumstances in your case which could or would render refusal
             a breach of article 8 of the ECHR because it  could  or  would
             result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  you  or  your
             family.  In  doing  so  we  have  taken  into  account,  under
             paragraph GEN.3.3 of Appendix FM, the best  interests  of  any
             relevant child as a primary consideration.


             You have provided no information or evidence to establish that
             there are any exceptional circumstances in your case."

The written submissions


     30. In his skeleton argument prepared for the hearing before the First-
         Tier Tribunal by Mr Pipe he confirms the  respondent  had  conceded
         the suitability relationship requirement and that the appellant had
         shown he can satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
     31. It was submitted the appellant had not contrived in  a  significant
         way to frustrate the intention of the Immigration  Rules  and  that
         his exclusion was not conducive to the public good.
     32. In her written submission to the Upper Tribunal Mrs Aboni writes:

             "It is submitted that the  appellant's  application  fell  for
             consideration under Para 320(11) as he had previously remained
             in the UK as an overstayer and had worked in  the  UK  without
             ever being given permission to do so.


             The Respondent submits that the ECO considered the appellant's
             circumstances and whether there were aggravating factors which
             justified a refusal under 320(11) in line  with  the  guidance
             and the decision was upheld by the ECM.


             The  Respondent  submits  that   the   list   of   aggravating
             circumstances is not exhaustive and that the ECO was justified
             in refusing the application under Para 320(11).


             It  is  submitted  that  the  appellant  was  not  merely   an
             overstayer but remained in the UK for approximately  14  years
             without Leave, following the refusal of  his  application  for
             Leave to Remain on the basis  of  work  permit  employment  in
             2004.  This application was refused with no right  of  appeal,
             however the appellant remained in the UK in full knowledge  of
             the fact that he was unlawfully in the UK.  He failed to  make
             any attempt to regularise his status until  2013  and  made  2
             unsuccessful applications for LTR  on  Art  8  grounds  on  15
             November 2013 and  4  April  2014.   He  than  again  remained
             unlawfully in the UK until 2015,  submitting  a  Human  Rights
             claim on 21 October 2015 after being served a removal decision
             on 18 May 2015.  This application was refused  and  he  became
             Appeal Rights Exhausted on 15 September 2017.


             He then again remained unlawfully in the UK until  he  finally
             made a voluntary departure on 21 September 2018.  Although  it
             is claimed that the appellant considered returning to Pakistan
             to seek Entry Clearance, he made no attempt to do so prior  to
             his arrest on 1 September 2018 and has not  demonstrated  that
             he had any intention  of  leaving  the  UK  had  he  not  been
             arrested.


             Although it is claimed that the appellant made no preparations
             to leave the UK  because  of  his  wife's  ill-health,  it  is
             submitted that her health  was  not  sufficiently  serious  to
             prevent his departure.   Although  it  is  accepted  that  she
             suffers from a number of medical conditions, she was  able  to
             undertake employment and had the support of her  children  and
             daughter-in-law.


             The respondent submits that the appellant's flagrant disregard
             for  the  Immigration  Rules  spanning  over  a   decade   and
             persistence in remaining unlawfully in the UK  does  represent
             sufficiently aggravating circumstances to reach  a  conclusion
             that he previously contrived in a significant way to frustrate
             the intentions of the Immigration Rules.


             The Tribunal is therefore invited to uphold  the  decision  to
             refuse Entry Clearance under Para 320(11).


             The Respondent submits  that  the  decision  to  refuse  Entry
             Clearance is proportionate and  that  the  appellant  has  not
             established that it has unjustifiably harsh  consequences  for
             him or his wife and her family.


             The Appellant and Sponsor  religiously  married  in  2011  and
             underwent a civil marriage in 2014.  It is submitted that both
             parties were aware that the appellant had no lawful status  in
             the UK and that they may not be permitted  to  continue  their
             family life together in the UK.


             The  appellant  has  not  established  that  there  are   very
             significant obstacles to his wife  joining  him  in  Pakistan.
             She was born and spent her formative  years  in  Pakistan,  is
             familiar with the  culture  and  has  maintained  family  ties
             there, visiting Pakistan on a number of occasions and  staying
             with her parents when she visited the appellant.


             At the time of  the  FTT  hearing  it  was  claimed  that  the
             appellant was living with his parents, who did not accept  the
             sponsor.  It is now claimed that he lives  with  a  friend  in
             overcrowded  and   unsuitable   circumstances,   however   the
             appellant has provided no satisfactory evidence of his current
             circumstances or failed to establish why he is unable to  gain
             employment in  Pakistan  to  support  himself  and  his  wife,
             relocating to another area if  there  are  problems  with  his
             family.  The appellant's son and  daughter-in-law  could  also
             continue to provide financial support as they have done in the
             past.


             Although it is accepted that the sponsor suffers from a number
             of medical conditions  she  would  have  the  support  of  her
             husband and she has not established that she would  be  unable
             to access any medical treatment or support that she  requires.
             The sponsor's mental health problems/depression are attributed
             to her pain and exacerbated by the separation from her husband
             but it is open to her to reunite with her husband in Pakistan.










             CONCLUSION


             The  Tribunal  is  invited  to  find  that  refusal  of  Entry
             Clearance under Para 320(11) is justified and that  there  are
             no sufficiently compelling circumstances  which  outweigh  the
             public interest.


             The Tribunal is therefore invited to dismiss the appeal.

     33. On behalf of the appellant Mr Pipe, in his  skeleton  argument  for
         the Upper Tribunal, writes:

             SKELETON ARGUMENT


               1. This skeleton is prepared following the Directions (T)  of
                  UTJ Hanson.


               2. The decision of FTTJ Hobson was set aside  by  UTJ  Hanson
                  save for the preserved findings identified at �8(b) of his
                  Error of Law Finding and Reasons dated 17th March 2020.


               3. This is an appeal against a decision dated 19th June  2019
                  refusing entry clearance to the  Appellant  as  a  partner
                  (application date: 9th December 2018).


               4. The ECM upheld the decision on 26th June 2019.


               5.  The  application  was  refused  under  EC-P.1.1.(d)  with
                  reference to �320(11), S-EC.1.5 and E-ECP.3.1.


               6. It was accepted by the Respondent,  at  the  FTT  hearing,
                  that  the  financial  requirements  were  met  (�11).  The
                  relationship  and  English  language   requirements   were
                  already conceded in  the  refusal  letter.  The  Appellant
                  therefore satisfies the substantive partner rules.


               7.  The  decision  is  a  disproportionate  breach   of   the
                  Appellant's Article 8 private and family life rights.  The
                  substantive rules are met, the general/suitability grounds
                  do not apply and  there  are,  in  any  event,  compelling
                  circumstances.


               8. In TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) v The Secretary  of  State
                  for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 (17 May 2018)
                  Sir Ernest Ryder, Senior President said at �34, 'That  has
                  the benefit that  where  a  person  satisfies  the  Rules,
                  whether or not by  reference  to  an  article  8  informed
                  requirement, then this will be positively determinative of
                  that  person's  article  8  appeal,  provided  their  case
                  engages article 8(1), for the very reason  that  it  would
                  then be disproportionate for that person to be removed.'


               9. The Tribunal is referred  to  the  representations,  dated
                  19th December 2018 (pages A1-A5 bundle) and the grounds of
                  appeal dated 29th March 2019.


              10. The Appellant has not contrived in a  significant  way  to
                  frustrate the intentions of the rules (�320(11))  and  his
                  exclusion is not conducive to the public good (S-EC.1.5).


              11. �320(11) states:


                      (11) where the applicant has previously contrived  in
                      a significant way to frustrate the intentions of  the
                      Rules by:


                      (i) overstaying; or


                      (ii) breaching a condition attached to his leave; or


                      (iii) being an illegal entrant; or


                      (iv) using deception  in  an  application  for  entry
                      clearance, leave to enter or remain or  in  order  to
                      obtain documents from the Secretary  of  State  or  a
                      third party required in support  of  the  application
                      (whether successful or not);


                      and there are other aggravating  circumstances,  such
                      as     absconding,     not     meeting      temporary
                      admission/reporting restrictions or bail  conditions,
                      using an assumed  identity  or  multiple  identities,
                      switching nationality, making frivolous  applications
                      or not complying with the re-documentation process.


              12. S.EC.1.5 states:


                      S-EC.1.5. The exclusion of the applicant from the  UK
                      is conducive to the public good because, for example,
                      the applicant's conduct (including convictions  which
                      do not fall within paragraph  S-EC.1.4.),  character,
                      associations, or other reasons, make  it  undesirable
                      to grant them entry clearance


              13. The burden of proof, in respect of the general grounds, is
                  upon the Respondent: JC (Part 9 HC395 - burden  of  proof)
                  China [2007] UKAIT 00027.


              14. �320(11) is a discretionary provision:  Balajigari  v  The
                  Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ
                  673 (16 April 2019).


              15. In relation to �320(11), the Tribunal is  referred  to  PS
                  (paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed)  India  [2010]
                  UKUT 440 (IAC) (28 September 2010):


                      14.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  in  making  the
                      decision of refusal, refers nowhere to  the  guidance
                      under paragraph  320(11).   It  is  therefore  wholly
                      unclear  whether  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  has
                      addressed his mind to the relevant  question,  namely
                      whether in the circumstances  of  this  case  Mr  S's
                      breach  of  UK  immigration  law   was   sufficiently
                      aggravating so as to justify the refusal.   It  seems
                      to us that the Entry Clearance  Officer  should  have
                      specifically recognised that  Mr  S  had  voluntarily
                      left the United Kingdom more than 12 months ago  with
                      a view to regularising his immigration status.  There
                      was no question but that the marriage was  a  genuine
                      one.  If the aggravating circumstances are not  truly
                      aggravating there is in this context a  serious  risk
                      that those in  the  position  of  Mr  S  will  simply
                      continue to remain in the United  Kingdom  unlawfully
                      and will not seek to regularise their  status  as  he
                      has sought to do.  The effect then is  likely  to  be
                      counter-productive to the  general  purposes  of  the
                      relevant rules and to the maintenance of  a  coherent
                      system of immigration.  However,  as  explained,  the
                      Entry Clearance Officer in this case did not  address
                      the  correct  question  and  did  not  carry  out  an
                      adequate balancing  exercise  under  the  guidelines.
                      Furthermore, Mr S had made a claim  under  Article  8
                      which, standing alone, may not have been very strong.
                       Nonetheless the family circumstances  needed  to  be
                      evaluated carefully  in  the  balancing  exercise  to
                      which we have referred.


                      15.  The decision of the immigration judge in  effect
                      endorsed the approach of the Entry Clearance  Officer
                      to the application of paragraph 320(11), an  approach
                      that was not in accordance with law.   Therefore  his
                      decision was vitiated by the same legal error,  which
                      amounts to a material error of law.   Accordingly  we
                      set aside the decision of the immigration  judge.  He
                      should have allowed the appeal on the basis that  the
                      decision of the Entry Clearance Officer  was  not  in
                      accordance  with  law.   Therefore  we   remake   the
                      decision by allowing the appeal  on  this  basis  and
                      remitting the matter to the  primary  decision-maker,
                      with  a  direction  that  Mr   S's   application   be
                      considered in accordance with this determination.


              16. The Respondent has not followed the approach set out in PS
                  (India).


              17. The Appellant has not contrived in a  significant  way  to
                  frustrate the intentions of the Rules. In  any  event  the
                  Respondent   should   have   exercised   her    discretion
                  differently.


              18. The Appellant made a voluntary departure on 21st September
                  2018  in  order  to  make  the  proper  application.   The
                  Appellant had  become  Appeal  Rights  Exhausted  on  15th
                  September 2017 (see pages F23-F24 bundle).


              19. At F6 bundle the Respondent suggested that  the  Appellant
                  return and apply for entry clearance which is what he did.


              20. At F7 bundle the Respondent stated, 'It is noted that  you
                  have  been  compliant  with  reporting  and  Home   Office
                  processes (e.g. attending interviews)'.


              21. The Appellant and Sponsor religiously married in 2011  and
                  underwent a civil marriage in 2014.


              22. The Sponsor is  in  ill-health  and  suffers  from  carpel
                  tunnel   syndrome,   inflammation   of   the   hands   and
                  fibromyalgia/chronic pain. The Sponsor also  suffers  from
                  low mood and anxiety. The Sponsor needs the support of the
                  Appellant and his presence would improve  her  mental  and
                  physical wellbeing. See pages E1-E9  bundle.  The  medical
                  evidence states (see E5 bundle):


                      '[Ms] explained that she works around 20 hours a week
                      as a customer assistant in Tesco where her colleagues
                      are supportive. She explained that she would  ideally
                      like to work more as she enjoys it but her pain means
                      she can only work this much. [Ms] feels exhausted and
                      has so much pain when she finishes a shift  that  she
                      has to take painkillers for the rest of the day  when
                      she gets home.'


              23. The Sponsor's health has worsened, her condition has  been
                  re-assessed and she now  receives  a  higher  PIP  payment
                  (pages S5-S6; previous PIP documentation at  pages  C1-C11
                  bundle). The Sponsor has been referred  to  Healthy  Minds
                  and is receiving counselling (pages S2-S4 bundle).


              24.  The  Appellant  lives  with  a  friend   in   overcrowded
                  conditions and the Sponsor could not reside  with  him  in
                  Pakistan.


              25. The Sponsor left Pakistan in 2001 with  her  two  children
                  and was granted asylum in the United Kingdom (�2  page  B3
                  bundle).


              26. The Appellant has  a  very  close  relationship  with  the
                  Sponsor's adult children. The Sponsor's  children  are  in
                  employment and her son and daughter in law are expecting a
                  child in the near future.


              27. The Respondent has not shown that �320(11) is made out and
                  the S-EC.1.5 refusal is also flawed.


              28. The requirements of the Immigration Rules are satisfied.


              29. The matters cited above  apply  mutatis  mutandis  to  the
                  consideration of the claim outside of the rules.


              30. In entry clearance Article 8 cases there is an  obligation
                  to promote family life rather  than  maintain  the  status
                  quo: Mostafa (Article 8 in entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT
                  112 (IAC) (6 March  2015)  and  Shamin  Box  [2002]  UKIAT
                  02212.


              31. In Quila & Anor, R (on the application of) v Secretary  of
                  State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 45  (12  October
                  2011) Lord Wilson said:


                      43.   Having  duly  taken  account  of  the  decision
                      in Abdulaziz pursuant to section  2  of  the  Human
                      Rights Act 1998, we should  in  my  view  decline  to
                      follow it. It is an old decision. There  was  dissent
                      from it even at the time. More  recent  decisions  of
                      the ECtHR, in particular Boultif and Tuquabo-Tekle,
                      are inconsistent with it.  There  is  no  "clear  and
                      consistent jurisprudence"  of  the  ECtHR  which  our
                      courts ought to follow: see R (Alconbury Developments
                      Ltd)    v    Secretary    of    State     for     the
                      Environment, Transport and the Regions [2001]  UKHL
                      23, [2003] 2 AC 295 at para 26, per Lord Slynn. The
                      court in Abdulaziz was in particular exercised by the
                      fact that the asserted obligation was positive. Since
                      then, however, the  ECtHR  has  recognised  that  the
                      often  elusive  distinction  between   positive   and
                      negative obligations should  not,  in  this  context,
                      generate a different outcome. The area of  engagement
                      of article 8 - in  this  limited  context  -  is,  or
                      should be, wider now. In that  in Tuquabo-Tekle the
                      state's refusal to admit the 15-year-old daughter  of
                      the mother, in circumstances in which  they  had  not
                      seen each  other  for  seven  years,  represented  an
                      interference with respect for their family life,  the
                      refusals of the Secretary of  State  in  the  present
                      case to allow the foreign spouses to reside in the UK
                      with the British  citizens  with  whom  they  had  so
                      recently entered into a consensual  marriage  must  a
                      fortiori represent such  an  interference.  The  only
                      sensible enquiry can be  into  whether  the  refusals
                      were justified.


              32. The rights of  the  Appellant's  British  wife  and  step-
                  children weigh heavily in the balance and should be  given
                  detailed and anxious scrutiny by the Tribunal: Beoku-Betts
                  v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2008]  UKHL
                  39 (25 June 2008).


              33. The appeal should be allowed on Article 8 grounds.


              34. The Tribunal should make a full fee award.

The law

     34. Paragraph 320(11) is a  discretionary  provision  and  states  that
         applications should normally be refused:

             (11)  where  the  applicant  has  previously  contrived  in  a
             significant way to frustrate the intentions of the Rules by:


                  (i)  overstaying; or


                  (ii) breaching a condition attached to his leave; or


                  (iii)    being an illegal entrant; or


                  (iv)  using  deception  in  an   application   for   entry
                  clearance, leave to enter or remain or in order to  obtain
                  documents from the Secretary of State  or  a  third  party
                  required in support of the application (whether successful
                  or not);


             and  there  are  other  aggravating  circumstances,  such   as
             absconding,   not   meeting   temporary    admission/reporting
             restrictions or bail conditions, using an assumed identity  or
             multiple identities, switching nationality,  making  frivolous
             applications  or  not  complying  with  the   re-documentation
             process."

     35. In PS (paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed) India [2010] UKUT
         440  (IAC)  the  Tribunal  directed  itself  to  the  guidance   on
         considering Entry Clearance applications under Para 320(11):

             14.  The Entry Clearance Officer, in making  the  decision  of
                  refusal, refers nowhere to the  guidance  under  paragraph
                  320(11).  It is therefore wholly unclear whether the Entry
                  Clearance Officer has addressed his mind to  the  relevant
                  question, namely whether in the circumstances of this case
                  Mr S's breach  of  UK  immigration  law  was  sufficiently
                  aggravating so as to justify the refusal.  It seems to  us
                  that the Entry Clearance Officer should have  specifically
                  recognised that Mr  S  had  voluntarily  left  the  United
                  Kingdom  more  than  12  months  ago  with   a   view   to
                  regularising  his  immigration  status.   There   was   no
                  question but that the marriage was a genuine one.  If  the
                  aggravating circumstances are not truly aggravating  there
                  is in this context  a  serious  risk  that  those  in  the
                  position of Mr S will simply continue  to  remain  in  the
                  United Kingdom unlawfully and will not seek to  regularise
                  their status as he has sought to do.  The effect  then  is
                  likely to be counter-productive to the general purposes of
                  the relevant rules and to the maintenance  of  a  coherent
                  system of immigration.  However, as explained,  the  Entry
                  Clearance Officer in this case did not address the correct
                  question and did  not  carry  out  an  adequate  balancing
                  exercise under the guidelines.  Furthermore, Mr S had made
                  a claim under Article 8 which,  standing  alone,  may  not
                  have   been   very   strong.    Nonetheless   the   family
                  circumstances needed to  be  evaluated  carefully  in  the
                  balancing exercise to which we have referred.

     36. Home Office Guidance - General grounds for refusal - Section  2  of
         5: Considering entry clearance, states:

             This page contains guidance for entry  clearance  officers  on
             what to consider when an applicant  for  entry  clearance  has
             previously  breached  the  Immigration  Rules  and  there  are
             aggravating circumstances.


             This relates to general grounds for  refusal  under  paragraph
             320(11) of the rules when the person has previously  contrived
             in a significant  way  to  frustrate  the  intentions  of  the
             rules...


             When an applicant  has  previously  breached  the  Immigration
             Rules and/or received services or support to which  they  were
             not entitled you must consider refusing the application.  When
             these circumstances are also aggravated by other actions  with
             the intention to deliberately frustrate the  rules,  you  must
             refuse entry clearance under paragraph 320(11).


             This means when an applicant has  done  one  or  more  of  the
             following:


                . been an illegal entrant


                . overstayed


                . breached a condition attached to their leave


                . used deception in a previous application


                . obtaining:


                    o asylum benefits


                    o state benefits


                    o housing benefits


                    o tax credits


                    o employment


                    o goods or services


                    o National Health Service (NHS) care using  an  assumed
                      identity or  multiple  identities  or  to  which  not
                      entitled


             and there are aggravating circumstances, such as:


                . absconding


                . not meeting temporary admission/reporting restrictions  or
                  bail conditions


                . failing to meet the terms of removal directions after port
                  refusal of leave to enter or illegal entry


                . previous working in breach on  visitor  conditions  within
                  short time of  arrival  in  UK  (indicating  a  deliberate
                  intention to work)


                . receiving benefits, goods or services when not entitled


                . using an assumed identity or multiple identities


                . getting NHS care to which they are not entitled


                . attempting to prevent  removal  from  the  UK,  arrest  or
                  detention by Home Office or police


                . escaping from Home Office detention


                . switching nationality


                . troublesome or frivolous applications


                . not meeting the terms of the re-documentation process


                . taking part, attempting to take part, or facilitating,  in
                  a sham marriage or marriage of convenience


                . harbouring an immigration offender


                . people smuggling or helping in people smuggling


             This is not a complete list of offences. You must consider all
             cases on their merits and take into account family life in the
             UK  and,  if  the  applicant  is  a  child,   the   level   of
             responsibility for any breach. Before  you  decide  to  refuse
             under this paragraph, you must refer your decision to an entry
             clearance manager (ECM) to be authorised.

Discussion


     37. There is no dispute between the parties as to  the  relevant  legal
         provisions or that all cases such as this  must  be  considered  on
         their merits, the activities considered in the round to see whether
         they meet  the  threshold  under  paragraph  320(11),  taking  into
         account family life in the UK and the level of  responsibility  for
         the breach. It is accepted there is an  overlap  between  assessing
         the discretionary element of paragraph 320(11) and article  8  ECHR
         in relation to the proportionality of the decision.
     38. It is  not  disputed  the  appellant  remained  in  the  UK  for  a
         considerable number of years as an overstayer  once  his  leave  to
         enter expired. This element of the 320(11) test is met. The  second
         element  requires  it  to  be  established  that  there  are  other
         aggravating  circumstances.  This  is  an  additional  element  the
         wording of which shows, even if the overstaying is made out  as  it
         is in this case, that  is  not  sufficient  to  warrant  a  320(11)
         refusal, per se.
     39. It is accepted the respondent's  guidance  set  out  above  is  not
         exhaustive, but the refusal letter only refers to  the  aggravating
         circumstance being satisfied as a result  of  the  appellant  being
         encountered undertaking unauthorised employment. No other  elements
         are relied upon by the decision maker.
     40. The appellant's arrest at a hotel in London  working  illegally  is
         not disputed by the appellant in his witness statement and nor  did
         he challenge the assertion in any proceedings before  he  left  the
         UK. For the purposes of  this  hearing  the  Tribunal  accepts  the
         respondent's assertion the appellant has  worked  as  claimed.  The
         Reasons for Refusal letter reads "On 21  September  2018  you  were
         apprehended by the Enforcement Team  as  they  visited  the  Europa
         Hotel in London where you were working". In the Grounds  of  Appeal
         to the First-tier Tribunal it is written:

             "We  would  submit  that  while  the  appellant  has  a   poor
             immigration history having remained as  a  overstayer  in  the
             United Kingdom,  and  also  having  been  encountered  working
             illegally,  the  appellant  nevertheless  made  an   immediate
             voluntary departure from the UK as soon as encountered  (which
             he paid the costs for) in order to regularise  his  stay,  and
             further has no criminal record."

         in which there is no denial of the fact the appellant  was  working
         illegally. What is not made out on the evidence, however,  is  that
         the  appellants  working  was  in  breach  of  visitor   conditions
         undertaken within  short  time  of  arrival  in  UK,  indicating  a
         deliberate  intention  to  work,  and   disingenuous   visit   visa
         application, which is not alleged in the refusal.
     41. It is not made out that the applications made by the appellant on 8
         December 2003, 15 November 2013, 4 April 2014 or  21  October  2015
         were frivolous,  on  the  basis  of  that  term  being  defined  as
         applications with no serious purpose, as they were  to  enable  the
         appellant to regularise his status based  upon,  for  example,  the
         existence of the family unit.
     42. It was accepted by the respondent in the refusal of 12 January 2016
         that the appellant had  been  compliant  with  reporting  and  Home
         Office processes.
     43. Even though the appellant overstayed and worked illegally there  is
         still the need to properly  consider  the  proportionality  of  the
         decision as part of the correct exercise of  discretion,  as  these
         are not matters that lead to a mandatory refusal. As  noted  above,
         it was accepted  by  Mr  Pipe  there  is  an  overlap  between  the
         discretionary element and the proportionality of  the  decision,  a
         fact recognised in the respondent's  guidance  where  the  need  to
         consider all relevant  aspects  is  recognised.  It  is  into  this
         element that the  decision  in  PS  arises  and  therefore  remains
         relevant today.
     44. The most effective way in which to consider such issues is that set
         out in R (Razgar) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2004] UKHL 27 which found that in a case where removal is resisted
         in reliance on article 8, these questions are likely to be:

               1. Will the proposed removal be an interference by  a  public
                  authority with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to
                  respect for his private or (as the  case  may  be)  family
                  life?


               2. If so, will such interference have  consequences  of  such
                  gravity as potentially to engage the operation of  article
                  8?


               3. If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


               4. If so, is such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic
                  society in the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                  safety or the economic well-being of the country, for  the
                  prevention of disorder or crime,  for  the  protection  of
                  health or morals, or for the protection of the rights  and
                  freedoms of others?


               5.  If  so,  is  such  interference  proportionate   to   the
                  legitimate public end sought to be achieved?

     45. Although this is not a removal case the questions focus the mind on
         relevant issues.
     46. It is not disputed the appellant enjoys family life with his  wife,
         and she with him, and that the relationships with the other  family
         members will  form  part  of  his  and  their  private  lives.  The
         appellant  also  had  a  private  life  based  upon  his  home  and
         friendships/associates and connections in the UK.  The  quality  of
         these ties increased in quality and duration as  a  result  of  the
         time the appellant spent in the UK. The issue in this appeal is the
         proportionality of the decision in relation  to  the  discretionary
         element of paragraph 302(11) and Article 8 ECHR.
     47. In a human rights appeal 117B of the NIAA 2002 reads:

             117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in
             all cases


             (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in
             the public interest.


             (2)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-


                  (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and


                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.


             (3)  It is in the public interest, and in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-


                  (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and


                  (b)  are better able to integrate into society.


             (4)  Little weight should be given to-


                  (a)  a private life, or


                  (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,


             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.


             (5)   Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private   life
             established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when   the   person's
             immigration status is precarious.


             (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
             the public interest does  not  require  the  person's  removal
             where-


                  (a)  the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and


                  (b)  it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                  leave the United Kingdom.

     48. As noted above, it is not disputed the appellant has been in the UK
         unlawfully.
     49. It is not disputed the appellant speaks good English and  will  not
         be a burden on the public purse whilst recognising that in Rhuppiah
         [2018] UKSC 58 it was found the subsection does not say that it  is
         in the public interest that those who are able to speak English etc
         should remain in the UK.  It says that it is in the public interest
         that those who seek to remain in the UK should speak  English  etc.
         Speaking English and being financially independent may add  to  the
         strength of private/family life but that is different  from  saying
         that where the factors exist there is a public interest  in  favour
         of the claim.
     50. In relation to the weight to be given to  the  appellant's  private
         life it was also held in Rhuppiah  that  Section  117A(2)(a),  when
         read in conjunction with section 117B(5), indicated  that  although
         courts should have regard to the consideration that  little  weight
         should be given to private life established when immigration status
         was precarious, it  was  possible  to  override  such  guidance  in
         exceptional  cases  where  the  private  life  had  a  special  and
         compelling character.  Such  an  interpretation  was  necessary  to
         prevent  section  117B(5)  from  being  applied  incompatibly  with
         Article 8.
     51. It is also accepted the issues that led to [Ms K] being  recognised
         as a refugee in 2001 are no longer applicable and will not  prevent
         her return to Pakistan to join her husband per se. Mrs Aboni in her
         submissions refer to the lack of evidence of the housing  situation
         of the appellant in Pakistan and differing accounts of his  current
         domestic arrangements, which has merit. Mr Pipe also confirmed  [Ms
         K] had visited the appellant in Pakistan relatively recently.
     52. Mrs Aboni submits that this indicates no  insurmountable  obstacles
         are made out to [Ms K] joining her husband in Pakistan where  their
         family life may continue as a result of  which  there  will  be  no
         breach of  Article  8  on  this  basis.  The  term  'insurmountable
         obstacles' appears in the Immigration Rules in relation to  Article
         8  under  Appendix   FM.    Exceptions   to   certain   eligibility
         requirements for leave to remain as a partner or parent are  to  be
         found in EX.1 and EX.2, which are for  applications  for  leave  to
         remain  only  and  has  no  application  to  an   entry   clearance
         application.
     53. It is also stated there is no evidence [Ms K]  will  be  unable  to
         obtain medical treatment for her conditions in Pakistan and that if
         her mental health issues arise  as  a  result  of  the  appellant's
         absence this will be resolved as they will be  together.  This  has
         not been shown  not  to  be  factually  incorrect  but  has  to  be
         considered together with the strength of [Ms K]'s  connection  with
         the UK as she is now a British Citizen, the presence of her family,
         home and work in this country, right to  access  health  and  other
         services, and the human rights of all the  family  members  as  per
         Beoku-Betts v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2008]
         UKHL 39.
     54. There is also the positive obligation to be found in Article 8 ECHR
         but, as noted in SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA  Civ  387,  Lord
         Justice Richards drew a distinction in entry  clearance  cases,  on
         the one hand, involving someone  outside  the  United  Kingdom  who
         applies to come here to take up or resume family life  when  family
         life  was  originally  established  in  ordinary   and   legitimate
         circumstances at  some  time  in  the  past,  rather  than  in  the
         knowledge  of  its  precariousness  in  terms  of  United   Kingdom
         immigration controls and cases, on the other,  where  someone  from
         the United Kingdom marries a  foreign  national  or  establishes  a
         family life with them at a stage when they are contemplating trying
         to live together in the United Kingdom, but  when  they  know  that
         their partner does not have a right to come  here.  In  the  latter
         cases, the relationship will have been formed under  conditions  of
         known precariousness and it will be appropriate to apply a  similar
         test of exceptional circumstances before a violation of  Article  8
         will be found to arise in  relation  to  a  refusal  to  grant  LTE
         outside the Rules, although in MM  (Lebanon)  [2017]  UKSC  10  the
         Supreme Court allowed the appeal  of  the  appellant  SS  (from  SS
         (Congo)) on the particular facts and, although it did  not  analyse
         the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, made the general comment that
         the issue is always whether the  authorities  have  struck  a  fair
         balance between the individual and public interests (see  paras  44
         and 103 in particular).
     55. Mr Pipe relies upon the decision in Shamin Box [2002]  UKIAT  02212
         in which the Tribunal said that in entry cases, Adjudicators should
         not treat the Article 8 question as "one of whether there had  been
         an unjustified interference with the right to  private  and  family
         life", but  should consider whether there had been  an  unjustified
         lack of respect for private and family life;  and  that  the  focus
         should be on whether, in the light of the positive  obligations  on
         the UK to facilitate family reunion, there has been  a  failure  to
         act in the particular circumstances of the case.  Nonetheless,  the
         Tribunal said that, in interference  and  lack  of  respect  cases,
         similar principles applied. In conducting the  necessary  balancing
         exercise, it remains relevant that a State does not have a  general
         obligation  to  respect  an  immigrant's  choice  of   country   of
         residence. It also remains relevant to consider whether  there  are
         insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  family  enjoying  family   life
         elsewhere.
     56. In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  112  (IAC)
         (McCloskey J) it was held that the decision in  Shamin  Box  [2002]
         UKIAT 02212 is to be followed and that the  obligation  imposed  by
         Article 8 is to promote the family life of those  affected  by  the
         decision.
     57. In Huang and Kashmiri v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 the House of Lords said
         that  there  would  in  almost  any   case   be   certain   general
         considerations to bear  in  mind  concerning  the  desirability  of
         maintaining a fair and effective  system  of  immigration  control.
         The giving of weight to such factors was not  however  "deference".
         It was the performance of the ordinary judicial task of weighing up
         the  competing  considerations  on   both   sides   and   according
         appropriate weight to the judgement of a person with responsibility
         for a particular subject matter and with access to special  sources
         of knowledge and advice.
     58. The key question when assessing the proportionality of the decision
         is whether, balancing the severity of the measure's effects on  the
         rights of the appellant and family against the  importance  of  the
         objective, to the extent that the measure will  contribute  to  its
         achievement, the former outweighs the latter.
     59. In PS it was recognised the decision maker must exercise great care
         in assessing the aggravating circumstances said to justify  refusal
         and must have regard to the public interest  in  encouraging  those
         unlawfully in the United Kingdom to leave and  seek  to  regularise
         their status by an application for entry clearance.  It is arguably
         correct that the decision maker in this case did not undertake this
         aspect of the  discretionary  exercise  properly  as  there  is  no
         mention of how this factor has been incorporated into the  exercise
         of discretion in the refusal at all. It was accepted, however, that
         the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider this element for  itself.
         I find the voluntary return as suggested by the respondent warrants
         greater weight being attributed to it than it  has  been  given  to
         date  in  light  of  the  relevant  public  policy   considerations
         identified in PS.
     60. The appellant accepts his past conduct was wrong and Mrs Aboni puts
         up a strong case as to why the appeal should be dismissed. This has
         to be weighed against those factors in the appellants favour  which
         include the fact he did leave the UK voluntarily at his own expense
         for the purposes of making a proper application to  enter  lawfully
         as a spouse, that there  is  an  accepted  genuine  and  subsisting
         family life with  his  spouse,  that  his  spouse  although  having
         Pakistan heritage is now a British citizen who lives  in  a  family
         unit in the UK with her son and his  expectant  wife,  that  it  is
         accepted the appellant  meets  the  Immigration  Rules  that  would
         ordinarily entitle him to the  grant  of  entry  sought,  and  none
         section 117B factors have been shown to count against him. There is
         also the positive obligation in relation to family life referred to
         above. The genuine marriage and  relationship  with  his  wife  and
         between her  the  wider  family  is  demonstrated  in  the  witness
         statements too.
     61. This is a fact specific decision in which  the  competing  elements
         have been balanced against each other. Having done so  I  find  the
         scales just tip in favour of the appellant in that the exercise  of
         discretion  in  this  case  should  be  in  his  favour  to   avoid
         incompatibility with Article 8 ECHR.  I find it not made  out  that
         the appellant has contrived in a significant way to  frustrate  the
         intentions of the rules or it shown that his exclusion is conducive
         to the public good.
     62. Mr Pipe sought the making of a fee order as the First-tier Tribunal
         refused to make such an  order.  In  Singh  (fee  award:  ancillary
         decision) [2013] UKUT 179 (IAC) the Tribunal held  that  the  Upper
         Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider a  challenge  to  a
         decision of a First-tier Tribunal Judge to make, or not to make,  a
         fee award. A decision on a  fee  award  is  an  ancillary  decision
         within the meaning of the Appeals (Excluded decisions)  Order  2009
         and is therefore not appealable.   On  appeal  in  Sandip  Singh  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 438  the
         Court of  Appeal  agreed.  The  Upper  Tribunal  therefore  has  no
         jurisdiction to consider a challenge to that part of the decision.




Decision


     63. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is allowed.

Anonymity.


     64. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
         45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
         2005.


         I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson
