Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Smith, Counsel instructed by Wesley Gryk
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State.  However,
    it is convenient to refer to the parties as they were before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 2. Thus, the appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 22 May 1974.   She
    initially arrived in the UK on 2 August 2005  with  valid  leave  as  a
    student.  The further background to her appeal is set out below.

 3. On 13 November 2013 the  respondent  made  a  decision  to  remove  the
    appellant under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  Her
    appeal against that decision was heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Oliver on 12 August 2014, whereby he allowed the appeal on human rights
    grounds with reference to Article 8 of the ECHR.  Permission to  appeal
    having been granted against that decision, the appeal came before me.

 4. Judge Oliver's determination contains a comprehensive statement of  the
    appellant's immigration history, that history not having been  disputed
    by either party.  Taking the background  facts  as  set  out  by  Judge
    Oliver, it appears that on 7 June 2013 the appellant applied for  leave
    to remain on Article 8 grounds  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    application was returned on 11 June 2013 because an incorrect  fee  had
    been submitted.   A  further  application  with  the  correct  fee  was
    submitted on 14 June 2013.  In the letter accompanying the  application
    the appellant's solicitors explained that she was no  longer  qualified
    as a Tier 2 migrant because her employer  had  inadvertently  lost  his
    sponsorship licence, leading to the  curtailment  of  her  leave.   The
    renewed application was refused on 23 July 2013 with no right of appeal
    because the appellant's leave had expired on 12 June 2013.

 5. On 30 August 2013 a further application  was  made.   Accompanying  the
    application was a letter from  the  appellant's  solicitors  explaining
    that because of a clerical error the firm's cheque had been written out
    in the sum of �561 instead of the correct figure  of  �578,  for  which
    they took responsibility.   The  application  of  30  August  2013  was
    refused on 15 September 2013.  Given that her leave had expired  on  12
    June 2013, she did not have leave at the time of  her  application  and
    therefore had no right of appeal.

 6. Following a letter before (judicial  review)  action,  the  Section  10
    decision dated 13 November 2013 was issued.   After  some  disagreement
    between the appellant's solicitors and the  Secretary  of  State  about
    whether the appellant had an in-country right of appeal, it appears  to
    have been accepted that the appellant did have an in-country  right  of
    appeal.  It is not now suggested that Judge Oliver had no  jurisdiction
    to hear the appeal.

    The determination of the First-tier Tribunal

 7. At [11] Judge Oliver stated as follows:

         "The facts of the case are not in dispute.  The  appellant  arrived
         in the United Kingdom on 2 August 2005 with  leave  as  a  student.
         She was unable to complete her studies because her father developed
         cancer and she devoted herself to looking after him.  He died on  2
         November 2006.  She continued  to  live  with  her  mother  as  the
         dependant of her brother, Asif, who was married to  a  French  wife
         who was exercising treaty rights.  The appellant was granted  leave
         to remain to study for a Masters degree  in  marketing  with  leave
         valid to 23 June 2009, after which  she  was  granted  three  years
         discretionary leave to remain as a post-study worker.  In 2010  she
         was employed by Kappa Management as  a  Tier  2  general  sponsored
         migrant and on 17 July 2012 was  granted  leave  to  remain  to  15
         August 2015.  It was during the course of  this  period  of  leave,
         however, that Kappa Management, by  now  known  as  Khi  Management
         International, lost their sponsorship licence because  the  officer
         responsible for this left their employment and in error no one took
         over the role.  The  emails  from  the  respondent,  reminding  the
         company  of  the  need  for  renewal,  had  gone  unnoticed.    The
         sponsorship expired on  12  February  2013  and  it  was  in  these
         circumstances that the respondent took the decision to curtail  the
         appellant's leave, because she no longer met  the  requirements  of
         leave as a Tier 2 migrant.  She was given 60 days  grace  until  12
         June 2013."

 8. Judge Oliver made a number of findings of fact.  He concluded  at  [20]
    that the appellant and her family  were  honest  witnesses  upon  whose
    evidence he could rely.  At [22] he concluded that her family life with
    her close family members  in  the  UK  involved  more  than  the  usual
    dependency among adult siblings and  that  removal  to  Pakistan  would
    involve an interference with  her  family  life  sufficient  to  engage
    Article 8.  In the same paragraph he concluded that  her  private  life
    could not realistically be easily replicated in Pakistan.

 9. Judge Oliver found that the appellant has a good command of English, is
    not a burden on the taxpayer and has clearly  already  integrated  into
    society.  She is not relying on a relationship formed while her  status
    was precarious.  He found that her status has always been lawful  [23].



10. He dismissed the appeal on asylum and humanitarian protection  grounds,
    as well as under the Immigration Rules.  However the appeal was allowed
    on human rights grounds with reference to Article 8 of the ECHR.

    Submissions

11. At the start of the hearing Mr Jarvis made an application to amend  the
    grounds of appeal to include an  argument  to  the  effect  that  Judge
    Oliver had erred in law in treating the  appellant's  circumstances  as
    one involving a 'near miss'.  This was with reference to  [24]  of  the
    determination where he had said that although there is no place  for  a
    near-miss, the  re-application  was  a  continuation  of  the  original
    application, that it was in time and attracted an in-country  right  of
    appeal.  I refused the application, taking into account that permission
    to appeal was  granted  as  long  ago  as  16  December  2014  and  the
    respondent was notified soon thereafter.   I  considered  that  if  the
    point was thought to be of such importance  it  should  have  been  the
    subject of an application to amend the grounds before the  day  of  the
    hearing.  It is important that in an appeal  from  a  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, the parties know in advance of the hearing  before
    the Upper Tribunal what points are to be argued or relied on.  This was
    not an appropriate case in which  to  grant  permission  to  amend  the
    grounds.

12. Otherwise, Mr Jarvis relied on the written grounds.  It  was  submitted
    that although the First-tier Judge did refer to Sections 117A-B of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  as  amended  ("the  2002
    Act") those provisions had not been applied properly.  Section  117B(5)
    states that little weight should be given  to  private  life  where  an
    appellant's status is "precarious".   That  includes  a  case  where  a
    person only has a temporary form of leave.

13. In accordance with Nasim and others (Article 8)  Pakistan  [2014]  UKUT
    00025 (IAC) the only expectation that the appellant could have had  was
    to be given a further period of limited leave.   The  First-tier  Judge
    had dealt with the appeal outside the  Immigration  Rules  as  a  free-
    ranging exercise which was impermissible.

14. Mr Jarvis said that although perhaps surprising,  the  judge's  finding
    that the appellant has family life in the UK had not been challenged.

15. In reply Ms Smith submitted that the respondent had failed to  identify
    any error of law in relation  to  the  assessment  of  proportionality.
    Judge Oliver had considered the documentary and oral evidence  and  the
    respondent's arguments amount only to disagreements  with  the  judge's
    decision.  Paragraphs 2-6  of  the  grounds  are  simply  generic.  The
    application by the appellant was made outside the Article 8 Immigration
    Rules and therefore the judge was right to look at  Article  8  proper.
    The judge had considered relevant authorities.

16. If Section 117(B)(5) was meant to exclude  any  reliance  on  temporary
    leave, it was open to Parliament to have said so  in  the  legislation.
    Furthermore, the expression "little  weight"  does  not  mean  that  no
    weight should be given to private life established at a time  when  the
    person's immigration status is precarious.

17. This is not a case which is comparable to the decision in Nasim and  is
    not a near-miss case in terms of family or private life.  There  is  no
    challenge to the judge's other factual findings.  It was  no  fault  of
    the appellant that her leave was curtailed.  It was  an  administrative
    error by the management of the business that she worked  for  that  the
    sponsor licence was not renewed.  In addition,  there  was  a  clerical
    error by the appellant's solicitors in writing a cheque for  the  wrong
    amount in the earlier application.  But for  those  circumstances,  the
    appellant would have continued to enjoy lawful residence.  This reduces
    the weight to be attached to immigration control in her case.

18. In reply Mr Jarvis submitted that if the judge was  going  to  consider
    the matter outside the  Immigration  Rules  he  had  to  do  that  with
    reference to the fact that the appellant had failed to meet those rules
    under Appendix FM.  Immigration control is not lessened  by  reason  of
    the fact that there were matters outside the appellant's control.

    My assessment

19. As already pointed out, Judge Oliver's conclusion  that  the  appellant
    has family life in the UK has not been the subject  of  any  challenge,
    albeit that on one view it might have been.  Nevertheless, I proceed on
    the footing that there is no error of law in  his  assessment  in  that
    regard.

20.  Although  the  First-tier  Judge  who  granted  permission  to  appeal
    considered that Judge Oliver had failed to have regard  to  the  public
    interest considerations set out in Section 117B of the 2002 Act, in his
    assessment of proportionality,  that  is  not  correct.   Judge  Oliver
    expressly referred to Sections 117A-B and considered them, at  [23]  of
    the determination.

21. I do not consider that it could be said that Judge Oliver did not  have
    proper regard to the relevant  provisions  of  the  amended  2002  Act,
    contained in Sections 117A-B.  Aside, as I have already mentioned, from
    the fact that he referred specifically to those sections, he noted that
    the appellant has a good command of English, is not  a  burden  on  the
    taxpayer and has clearly already integrated into society.  He was  thus
    entitled to conclude, to use his words,  that  "the  appellant  emerges
    very well from the application  of  the  principles  set  out"  in  the
    amendments to the 2002 Act.

22. Mr Jarvis submitted that  the  word  "precarious"  in  Section  117B(5)
    includes persons with temporary leave.  Section 117B(5) provides that:

         "Little weight should be given to a private life established  by  a
         person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration   status   is
         precarious."

23. Ms Smith on the other hand contended that if it was intended that  this
    should include persons with temporary leave, the statute would say  so.
    There is some merit in that submission in my view, although it does not
    provide a complete answer to  the  question  of  whether  persons  with
    temporary leave are to be considered within Section 117B(5) as  persons
    whose "immigration status is precarious."

24. The Oxford English dictionary defines "precarious" as meaning 'held  at
    the pleasure of another; uncertain or dependent  on  chance;  insecure;
    unstable'.  Further meanings  are:  'assumed  gratuitously;  unfounded;
    doubtful'.  I note that S.117B(4) provides as follows:

         "Little weight should be given to -

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that  is
                  established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully."

25. Thus, the word "precarious" in sub-section (5) does not mean,  or  does
    not relate solely to, persons who are in the United Kingdom unlawfully.
     That is dealt with already in S.117B(4).  "Precarious" must  therefore
    mean something  either  different  from,  or  additional  to,  unlawful
    status.

26. I do not accept the proposition advanced by Mr  Jarvis  to  the  effect
    that it means persons who have temporary leave, insofar  as  Mr  Jarvis
    sought to suggest that all such persons are to be considered as persons
    whose immigration status is  precarious.   Some  individuals  who  have
    purely temporary leave may  be  in  a  more  precarious  position  than
    others.  Thus,  a  person  with  leave  to  remain  as  a  partner  who
    unquestionably is able to meet all the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules for indefinite leave to remain, is arguably not  a  person  whose
    immigration status is precarious.  To take another  example,  a  person
    who has accrued almost ten years' lawful residence  and  who  has  been
    granted another period of leave to bring them up to ten years,  without
    any countervailing considerations, again is not  someone  whose  status
    could be said to be precarious.  On the other hand, a student  who  has
    failed examinations and needs to re-take,  or  whose  place  on  a  new
    course is doubtful, could be  said  to  be  someone  whose  immigration
    status is precarious.

27. In my judgement the question of whether a person's  immigration  status
    is precarious is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis,  depending  on
    the circumstances.

28. Furthermore, in relation to this appeal, it is to  be  remembered  that
    S.117B(5) is limited to a private  life  established  when  a  person's
    immigration status is precarious.  It does not refer  to  family  life.
    Although Judge Oliver did base his decision on proportionality in  part
    on the appellant's private life, her family life in the UK seems to  me
    to have been the most significant feature of her Article 8 rights  that
    he took into account.

29. There has been no specific complaint on behalf  of  the  respondent  in
    relation to Judge Oliver's  conclusions  at  [23]  and  [24]  that  the
    appellant's status in the UK  has  always  been  lawful.   At  [23]  he
    expressed the view that the appellant's status had always  been  lawful
    "since I shall now go on to find  that  her  application  was  made  in
    time."  There then followed the reasoning at [24] where he said this:

         "Her initial application was made in time  on  7  June  2013.   The
         respondent's assertion that it was invalid because the fee paid  on
         her behalf by her solicitors was in the sum of �561 and not �578, a
         trivial mistake which the solicitors have conceded, and the further
         assertion that because the corrected application with a  cheque  in
         the correct sum was received 2 days after her leave had expired  is
         unworthy  of  any   properly-functioning   administrative   system.
         Although there is no place for a near miss  I  find  that  the  re-
         application was a continuation of the original application, that it
         was in time and attracted an in-country right of appeal against the
         subsequent refusal."

30. I do consider  that  Judge  Oliver  was  wrong  to  conclude  that  the
    appellant's status in the UK had always been lawful.  Regardless of the
    fact that the application made on 7 June 2013 was  invalid  through  no
    fault of hers, because her solicitors  sent  a  cheque  for  the  wrong
    amount, the application was correctly regarded  by  the  respondent  as
    invalid.  The requisite fee had not been  paid.   Her  leave  had  been
    curtailed to 12 June 2013, and thus the further  application  with  the
    correct fee made by her solicitors on 14 June 2013  was  out  of  time.
    From 12 June 2013 the appellant has had no leave to remain.

31. Although no complaint was made on behalf of the respondent in  relation
    to the judge's finding that the appellant had always had lawful  leave,
    I am nevertheless satisfied that he erred in law in his  conclusion  in
    this regard.

32. However, it could not be said that her private life, for the most part,
    was established at a time when she  was  in  the  UK  unlawfully.   Her
    private life was substantially established during her lawful residence.
     In any event, as I have already pointed out, the major focus for Judge
    Oliver's decision was the appellant's family life in the UK.  His error
    of law in terms of the finding that the appellant has always had lawful
    status in the UK is not material on the facts of this appeal.

33. Although the decision in Nasim and others was cited in argument  before
    me, it was specifically referred to by Judge Oliver at [21],  referring
    to [11] of Nasim and others which itself quotes from  the  decision  in
    Patel and Others v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2013]
    UKSC 72 as follows:

         "57. It is important to remember that article 8 is  not  a  general
             dispensing power. It is to be distinguished from the Secretary
             of State's discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the
             rules, which may be unrelated to any  protected  human  right.
             The merits of a decision not to depart from the rules are  not
             reviewable on appeal: section 86(6). One may  sympathise  with
             Sedley  LJ's  call  in  Pankina  for  'common  sense'  in  the
             application of the rules to graduates who have  been  studying
             in the UK for some years... However,  such  considerations  do
             not by themselves provide grounds of appeal under  article  8,
             which is concerned with private or family life, not  education
             as such. The opportunity for a promising student  to  complete
             his course in  this  country,  however  desirable  in  general
             terms, is not in itself a right protected under article 8."

34. Judge Oliver also referred to the decisions in Gulshan (Article 8 - new
    Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and Nagre v Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin).  He therefore
    recognised that the appellant  needed  to  establish  that  there  were
    exceptional circumstances not adequately addressed under the Article  8
    immigration rules in order to  be  able  to  succeed  under  Article  8
    proper.   He  then  went  on  to  make  an  assessment  of  what  those
    circumstances were.  I do not accept the submission made by  Mr  Jarvis
    to the effect that Judge Oliver had failed to take  into  account  that
    the appellant did not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.
    That he did take that matter into account is at least implicit in  [22]
    of the determination where he stated that the appellant's removal would
    be in accordance with  the  law  as  represented  by  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE, going on to  refer  to  the  need  for  there  to  be
    exceptional  circumstances  not  adequately  addressed  under  the  new
    Article 8 immigration rules.  At [25] he concluded that the appellant's
    circumstances had not been adequately addressed with reference  to  the
    Article 8 Immigration Rules.

35. He took into account, as he was entitled to do,  that  the  appellant's
    leave was curtailed through no fault of her own, she  no  longer  being
    qualified as a Tier 2 migrant because her  employer  had  inadvertently
    lost its sponsorship licence.  A further error, not of the  appellant's
    making, was that her solicitors sent a cheque for the wrong  amount  in
    respect of the application for leave to remain made  whilst  she  still
    had leave.  But for those errors the appellant would have  accrued  ten
    years' lawful residence by 15 August 2015 which was the date  on  which
    her leave originally expired, before it was curtailed  because  of  the
    loss of the sponsorship licence.  For the avoidance of doubt, I am  not
    satisfied that Judge Oliver considered this as a  near-miss  case.   He
    simply took into account the appellant's circumstances and  what  would
    have been likely to result had the errors not been made.

36. The legitimate aim in this case was, in shorthand, the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control.  Judge Oliver noted  at  [26]  that  the
    respondent was content to give the appellant  leave  which  would  have
    resulted in her having spent ten years lawfully in  the  UK,  a  matter
    which reflected on the issue of immigration control.  He concluded that
    the legitimate aim was weakened for that reason, but  he  did  not  say
    that it was extinguished.  He balanced the legitimate aim  against  the
    appellant's family and private life.

37. Whilst it could be said that there was room for a different outcome  in
    the proportionality assessment, I am not satisfied  that  it  could  be
    said that there is any error of law in  Judge  Oliver's  conclusion  in
    relation to proportionality,  excepting  the  error  to  which  I  have
    already referred.

38. In conclusion, I am not satisfied that there is any material  error  of
    law in Judge Oliver's decision.

    Decision

39. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law such as to require the decision  to  be  set
    aside.  The decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds therefore
    stands.



Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek  15/04/15
