Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Although an anonymity direction was not made by the First-tier Tribunal,  as
a protection claim, it is appropriate that a direction is made.  Unless  and
until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is  granted
anonymity. No report of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family.  This  direction  applies  amongst
others to all parties. Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to
contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The Appellant appeals against  a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
       Judge  Lambert  promulgated  on  27  April  2017  ("the   Decision")
       dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's
       decision dated 4 June 2016 refusing his protection and human  rights
       claims.


    2. The Appellant is a national of Iraq.   He left Iraq on 2  June  2014
       and travelled via Turkey and France before arriving illegally in the
       UK.  He claimed asylum on 11 December  2015.   The  Appellant  comes
       from Kirkuk.  As such, he says that he is entitled to succeed on the
       basis of Article 15(c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive  ("Article
       15(c)"), following the country guidance case of AA  (Article  15(c))
       CG [2015] UKUT 544 ("AA") as Kirkuk is found by that decision to  be
       a "contested area".  He says that  he  cannot  relocate  to  Baghdad
       because he has no documentation (CSID) or support network there  and
       it would be unduly harsh to require him to do so.  He also says that
       he cannot relocate to IKR because he does not come from that area.


    3. The Judge accepted that there were "no real credibility  issues"  in
       the appeal save possibly as to the whereabouts of his family members
       and whether the Appellant remains in contact with them ([9.2] of the
       Decision).  However, based on the Home Office's Country  Policy  and
       Information Note Iraq: Security and humanitarian situation  (Version
       4.0: March 2017) ("the Home Office guidance"),  the  Judge  rejected
       the Appellant's claim to be unable  to  return  to  his  home  area,
       finding that it was no longer a "contested area" following defeat of
       ISIL by the Iraqi authorities in that area.  The Judge therefore did
       not accept that Article  15(c)  continued  to  apply.  She  did  not
       therefore accept that the Appellant could not return to Kirkuk.


    4. The Appellant's grounds raise  one  issue.   Since  that  ground  is
       succinctly pleaded, it is convenient to set out what that says:-


            "3.  In SG (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
           [2012] EWCA Civ  940  the  court  stated  'decision  makers  and
           tribunal  judges  are  required   to   take   Country   Guidance
           determination into account,  and  to  follow  them  unless  very
           strong  grounds  supported  by  cogent  evidence,  are   adduced
           justifying their not doing so' (paragraph 47).
            4.   The Appellant contends  the  judge  erred  in  failing  to
           follow the Country Guidance case of AA (Article 15(c))  Iraq  CG
           [2015] UKUT 00544  (IAC)  in  finding  Kirkuk  is  no  longer  a
           contested area in Iraq.
            5.   The judge relied instead, solely  on  one  single  source,
           namely, Country Policy and Information Note - Iraq: Security and
           humanitarian situation (March 2017).
            6.   In the  circumstances,  the  Appellant  contends  was  not
           entitled to depart from the CG case of  AA  in  the  absence  of
           cogent evidence that the situation in Kirkuk had changed to  the
           extent that it was safe for the Appellant to return there."


    5. Permission to appeal was refused by Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Woodcraft on the basis that the Judge was entitled to rely  on
       the  Home  Office  guidance,  having  given  adequate  reasons   for
       departing from AA and that "the Appellant had nothing to counter  it
       (except it appears the head note to AA)".  Following renewal to this
       Tribunal, permission to appeal was granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge
       O'Connor in the following terms:-


           "It [is] arguable that the FtT erred in  failing  to  adequately
           reason its conclusion that there is not an Article 15(c) risk to
           the appellant in Kirkuk, given  the  conclusions  of  the  Upper
           Tribunal in AA (Iraq) CG [2015] UKUT 544"


    6. The Respondent filed a Rule 24 response which reads as  follows  (so
       far as relevant):-


           "2....the judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  directed  themself
           appropriately.  The judge was entitled to consider a  change  in
           circumstances since the promulgation  of  any  country  guidance
           case and is entitled to depart from aspects of that  case  where
           there is sufficient evidence to do so (R (Iran)  v  SSHD  [2005]
           EWCA Civ 982 at �26,27). This view is further supported in  Amin
           v SSHD [2017] EWHC 2417 at �62,63).
            3.   The grounds are attempting to re-argue  matters  that  the
           judge has adequately dealt with and given adequate  reasons  for
           rejecting the appellant's case.  The judge  had  regard  to  the
           arguments advanced by the appellant and  the  respondent  before
           concluding that the evidence  was  such  as  to  find  that  the
           appellant's home area was no longer a contested area."


    7. The matter comes before me to decide whether the Decision involves a
       material error of law and if so to either re-make  the  decision  or
       remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.

      Decision and Reasons


    8. The material part of the Decision is at [9.4] to [9.7] as follows:-


            "[9.4]     I turn to the issue of risk in the Appellant's  home
           area.  He has  never  maintained,  and  the  evidence  does  not
           disclose, that he is or has been at any individual risk in Iraq.
            So far as Article 15(c) is concerned, paragraph 2.3.21  of  the
           Home Office 14 March 2017 Policy and Information Note explicitly
           tells me that 'the security situation has  changed  since  April
           2015, the point up to which AA considered evidence.   Daesh  has
           suffered and continues to suffer significant territorial losses.
             Daesh now only control...  Hawija  and  surrounding  areas  in
           Kirkuk governorate'.  It was not challenged before me  that  the
           Appellant's village is not near Hawija and  is  not  within  the
           above areas in Kirkuk.
            [9.5]      Ms Faryl argued that the above information  was  not
           specifically referenced.  However the preface to the Policy note
           under 'Country Information' states that the COI within the  note
           has been compiled from a wide range of external sources and goes
           on to emphasise the attempts made to corroborate the information
           from independent sources to ensure accuracy.  Given that I  have
           no reason to doubt  this  statement  as  to  the  existence  and
           reliability of source material for the information contained  in
           the  policy  note,  and  given  the  evidential  limitations  on
           hearings at First Tier level that do not set  out  to  establish
           country guidance, I am not prepared to dismiss  the  content  of
           the policy note on this ground alone.
           [9.6] Ms Faryl referred me to the  current  FCO  travel  advice,
           which she argued conflicted with the policy note with the result
           that I should conclude the situation  Appellant's  home  village
           (sic) remained within Article 15(c).  The  FCO  include  'Kirkuk
           province' in the areas to which 'all travel' is advised against.
             Advice  against  travel  does  not  of  itself  establish  the
           conditions for Article 15(c) protection.  I find it  significant
           that a later paragraph (second paragraph p2) of the FCO  advice,
           which deals specifically with areas controlled  by  Daesh,  does
           not include Kirkuk.   Therefore,  on  the  issue  of  areas  now
           controlled by Daesh, there is in fact no conflict at all between
           the two documents.
            [9.7]      I conclude having  regard  to  the  above  that  the
           respondent has produced  reliable  and  consistent  up  to  date
           evidence  justifying  a  departure  from  AA  so  far  as   this
           Appellant's specific home area of Kirkuk province is  concerned.
           The situation in his village has changed since his departure  in
           June 2014 and since the decision in AA.  Daesh no longer control
           the area and there is no longer any evidence of circumstances in
           that village giving rise to Article 15(c) protection."


    9. Having heard oral submissions from  Ms  Faryl  and  Mr  Harrison,  I
       indicated at the hearing that I  was  satisfied  that  the  Decision
       discloses a material error of  law  and  that  I  would  provide  my
       reasons for that conclusion in writing which I now turn to do.


   10. I begin by recording the relevant parts of the headnote in AA:-


            "1.  There is at present a state of internal armed conflict  in
           certain parts of Iraq,  involving  government  security  forces,
           militias of various kinds, and the Islamist group knows as ISIL.
           The intensity of this armed conflict in the so-called "contested
           areas", comprising the governorates  of  Anbar,  Diyala,  Kirkuk
           (aka Ta'min), Ninewah and Salah  Al-din,  is  such  that,  as  a
           general matter, there are substantial grounds for believing that
           any civilian returned there, solely on account  of  his  or  her
           presence  there,  faces  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to
           indiscriminate violence amounting to  serious  harm  within  the
           scope of Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive.
            2.   The degree of armed  conflict  in  certain  parts  of  the
           "'Baghdad belts" (the urban environs  around  Baghdad  City)  is
           also of the intensity described in paragraph  1  above,  thereby
           giving rise to a generalised Article 15(c) risk.  The  parts  of
           the Baghdad Belts concerned are those forming the border between
           the Baghdad Governorate and the  contested  areas  described  in
           paragraph 1."


   11. I have included in that citation [2] of the headnote  to  show  that
       the issue whether ISIL remains in occupation of a particular area is
       not and cannot be decisive of  the  question  whether  there  is  an
       Article 15(c) risk in that area.  The Judge has conflated those  two
       issues in what she says at [9.4] of the Decision.  It  may  well  be
       relevant to the risk of indiscriminate violence that ISIL  has  been
       defeated in that area but that does not of itself mean that there is
       no longer such a risk.


   12. The second error disclosed in the Decision is the  Judge's  reliance
       on the Home Office guidance.  Although obviously the  Respondent  is
       one of the parties to the appeal, I have no difficulty in  accepting
       that the  Judge  is  entitled  to  have  regard  to  that  guidance,
       particularly having regard to its  methodology  and  sourcing.   The
       difficulty with the Judge's approach is that she appears to have had
       before her only the extracts which give an overview  of  the  issues
       and the Respondent's reply to them.  She has not  been  referred  to
       later sections of the Home Office  guidance  which  expand  on  that
       overview and which may be expected to bear reference by footnotes to
       the sources from  which  the  conclusions  are  drawn.   By  way  of
       example, although the passage expressly cited by the Judge does  not
       include  cross-references,  there  is  reference  in  the  following
       paragraph to a link to "Number of returnees and  places  of  return"
       associated with the statement that  "Returns  are  taking  place  to
       areas of the country that Daesh previously controlled".


   13. The Appellant also relies on what is said at [2.3.24]  of  the  Home
       Office guidance as follows:-


           "[2.3.24] In the six governorates  worst  affected  by  violence
           (Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala, Kirku, Ninewah and Salah  al-Din),  the
           number of security  incidents  has  either  remained  steady  or
           steadily declined since April 2015, when the Upper  Tribunal  in
           AA considered evidence.  The exception to this is Ninewah, where
           the number of security incidents is erratic, with high spikes in
           violence."
           [my emphasis]


   14. As the Appellant rightly points out, if it  is  the  case  that  the
       security incidents in Kirkuk have remained steady since April  2015,
       then based on AA, the Judge should have accepted that there  remains
       a risk which is sufficient to satisfy the Article 15(c) threshold.


   15. The other point to be made about this passage though is  that  there
       is  a  cross-reference  to  a  later  section   entitled   "Security
       Incidents".  The Judge did not refer to that section  which  expands
       on the proposition that the number of security  incidents  may  have
       stayed the same or declined and provides not only graphs showing the
       numbers of casualties which would allow comparison with the position
       at the date of AA but also cross-references the source of that data.


   16. The Judge was right to point out the difficulties for  a  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge seeking to, in effect, carry out a  country  guidance
       function in an  individual  case.   That  is  why  country  guidance
       exists.  There may be some clear cases where the evidence all points
       in one direction and does not require the sort of  cross-referencing
       and sourcing analysis to which I refer above but that  is  not  this
       case.


   17. Finally, there is a third error which is probably the more  obvious.
       The Judge was clearly entitled to give limited  weight  to  the  FCO
       travel advice.  That is not produced to inform immigration  appeals.
       However, the Appellant did not simply rely on that and the  headnote
       in AA as appears to be assumed in the First-tier Tribunal's  refusal
       of permission.  There was a bundle of background evidence running to
       198 pages before the Judge.  True it is  that  pages  1-60  are  the
       decision in AA.  However, the remainder is  evidence,  mostly  post-
       dating that considered in AA.  Some of that is at one with the  Home
       Office guidance (unsurprisingly since it also emanates from the Home
       Office albeit is earlier than March 2017).  However,  the  Appellant
       has included the whole of such reports which expands on the security
       situation in Kirkuk.  Other  of  that  documentation  emanates  from
       other  sources.   While  much  of  the  evidence  relates   to   the
       humanitarian situation, there is some evidence in this bundle  which
       relates to the security situation.  In  any  event,  the  Judge  has
       assumed that the findings in relation to Article 15(c) can simply be
       read across to humanitarian protection and no reference is  made  to
       this evidence.


   18. None of the above is intended to suggest that it is not  open  to  a
       Judge to decline to follow a country  guidance  case.   However,  as
       noted in the case to which the Appellant refers in his  grounds,  to
       do so requires "very strong grounds supported by  cogent  evidence".
       It may be that the Home Office guidance on which the  Judge  relied,
       if analysed in depth, may provide such  cogent  evidence.   However,
       the overview on which the Judge relied without any analysis  of  the
       underlying evidence did not.


   19. For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that the Decision includes
       a material error of law. I therefore set aside  the  Decision.   The
       Decision is based on the Judge's finding that the Appellant will not
       face an Article 15(c) risk and can therefore be returned to  Kirkuk.
       That  issue  requires  a   fresh   evaluation   on   the   evidence.
       Furthermore, based on that conclusion, the Judge has not gone on  to
       consider  the  issue  of  internal   relocation   and   humanitarian
       protection if it is subsequently found that the Appellant cannot  be
       returned to Kirkuk.  For those reasons, it is appropriate  for  this
       appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  hearing  by  a
       Judge other than Judge Lambert.


      DECISION
    I am satisfied that the Decision involves an error of law. The decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert promulgated on 27  April  2017  is
    set aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  re-
    hearing before a different Judge.
