                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appeal

 1.  This  is  an  appeal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer   against   a
    determination promulgated on 30 April 2015 of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    James which allowed  a  visit  visa  appeal  under  the  provisions  of
    paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.

 2. For the purposes of this decision,  I  refer  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer as the respondent and to Mr Osman as the appellant,  reflecting
    their positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a national of Sudan, born on 29 May 1980.

 4. The appellant applied for entry clearance to visit his brother in order
    to donate a kidney.

 5. The application was refused on 5 February  2014.  The  application  was
    refused as it was not found that the appellant had shown  that  he  was
    related as claimed to the sponsor.  The  evidence  of  the  appellant's
    employment was not found to be reliable. The sponsor's  bank  statement
    did not show  that  he  could  afford  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  the
    appellant's travel and maintenance in the UK. Paragraphs 41 (i),  (ii),
    (vi) and (vii) were not found to be met.

 6. Judge James allowed the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules,  finding
    that the appellant was the brother of  the  sponsor,  was  employed  in
    Sudan as claimed and that his brother could pay for his visit.

 7. It was common ground before me that this was an error  where  the  only
    permissible grounds of appeal are those at section 84(1)(b) and (c)  of
    the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  which  are  race
    discrimination or human rights grounds. The First-tier Tribunal had  no
    jurisdiction to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 8. Mr Chohan sought to defend the decision, maintaining that the error was
    not material where, given the findings of the First-tier Tribunal,  the
    appeal had to be allowed under Article 8. I could not agree  where,  in
    my judgement, there was nothing approaching  a  substantive  Article  8
    consideration here, not even an assessment of whether the appellant and
    sponsor had shown that they had a family life. It  could  not  be  said
    that the outcome of the appeal would have been the same had  the  judge
    decided the case correctly on an Article 8 ECHR basis only.

 9. I therefore set  aside  the  decision  and  re-made  it  after  hearing
    submissions from the parties. My approach to the Article  8  assessment
    remains that as set out in R (Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27 and Huang v
    SSHD [2007] UKHL 11 but with the provisions  of  section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  being  applied  in  any
    proportionality assessment.

10. I reminded myself that the case of Adjei  (visit  visas  -  Article  8)
    [2015] UKUT 0261 (IAC) states:

         "For a person who does not satisfy the requirements of para 41,  to
         succeed in an appeal there would have to be cogent  and  compelling
         reasons demanding that he should succeed."

11. It was common ground that the first key  issue  here  was  whether  the
    appellant and sponsor had shown that they had a  family  life  for  the
    purposes of Article 8 ECHR.

12. In the case of Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT  0261  (IAC)
    it was stated that it is likely to be only "infrequently"  that  family
    life can be made out in the context of a visit visa.

13. In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112  (IAC)  [24],
    the Presidential panel said as follows on the assessment of family life
    in the context of a visit visa application:

         "It  would  therefore  be  extremely  foolish  to  attempt  to   be
         prescriptive,  given   the   intensely   factual   and   contextual
         sensitivity of every case.  Thus we refrain from  suggesting  that,
         in this type of case, any particular  kind  of  relationship  would
         always attract the protection of Article 8(1) or that  other  kinds
         of relationship  would  never  come  within  its  scope.   We  are,
         however, prepared to say that it  will  only  be  in  very  unusual
         circumstances that a person other than a  close  relative  will  be
         able to show that refusal of entry clearance comes within the scope
         of Article 8(1).  In practical terms it is likely to be limited  to
         cases where the relationship is that of husband and wife  or  other
         close life partners or a parent and minor child and  even  then  it
         will not necessarily be extended to cases where, for  example,  the
         proposed visit is based on a whim or will not add significantly  to
         the time that the people involved spend together.  In  the  limited
         class of cases where Article 8(1) ECHR is engaged  the  refusal  of
         entry  clearance  must  be  in  accordance   with   the   law   and
         proportionate."

14. Both cases accord with the learning in Kugathas v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and Ghising (family  life  -
    adults - Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT  00160  (IAC)  that  a  finding  of
    family life is fact specific.

15. From the evidence before me it was entirely clear  that  the  appellant
    and sponsor are brothers. That is their consistent evidence, it is  the
    view of  the  transplant  team  at  the  Queen  Elizabeth  Hospital  in
    Birmingham and the reason why, after appropriate  tests,  he  has  been
    identified as the only viable kidney donor for the sponsor.

16. It is also my view that there is family  life  here.  In  the  ordinary
    course of things there may well not be a family between adult brothers,
    additionally so when they live in different  countries.  It  is  in  my
    judgement uncontentious, however, that when a sibling becomes very ill,
    as is undisputed here, that  can  be  a  time  when  relationships  and
    dependency become more intense such that adult siblings can be said  to
    have a family life. That is what has happened here. The relationship of
    the brothers is additionally close and more dependent  here  where  the
    appellant is the only person identified as a  suitable  donor  for  his
    brother.  On the particular and unusual facts of this case, I find  far
    more than usual emotional ties and dependency such that  there  can  be
    said to be family life that engages Article 8 ECHR, even in the context
    of a visit visa application.

17. The parties approached the case on the basis that if  family  life  was
    shown, the only remaining issue was proportionality.

18. I remind myself that  the  maintenance  of  immigration  control  is  a
    central and primary factor in the assessment of  proportionality.  This
    appellant's application under the Immigration Rules has  not  succeeded
    and that is a central, very weighty factor against him.

19. The provisions of section 117B  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 must also be applied:

         117B  Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
         cases

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.

         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

         ...

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that is
             established by a person at a time when the person is in the
             United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
             the United Kingdom.

20. I have dealt with the primacy and weight of the public  interest  above
    where the appellant has not succeeded under the Immigration Rules.

21. Nothing before me suggests that the appellant speaks  English  so  that
    must be weighed against him.

22. The funds provided by the  sponsor  to  pay  for  the  visit  were  not
    disputed before me. A sum of over �3,000 has been collected to pay  for
    his visit. Accommodation is to be provided for free by the sponsor.  It
    did not seem to me that the cost of  the  kidney  transplant  could  be
    weighed against the appellant where it arises  from  the  need  of  the
    sponsor, not the appellant, and that the NHS will only have to  provide
    intensive kidney dialysis for many years if  the  transplant  does  not
    take  place.  I  was  satisfied  that  the  appellant  is   financially
    independent such that he will not be a burden on the tax payer.

23. The other 117B factors are not readily applicable in the context of  an
    entry clearance made in these circumstances and where no  children  are
    concerned.

24. I also noted that  there  was  no  challenge  in  the  grounds  or  the
    submissions before me to the substantive findings of Judge  James  that
    the provisions of the Immigration Rules were met here. That appeared to
    me to be a correct approach on the part of the respondent, the evidence
    of  the  appellant  and  sponsor  being  consistent  and  supported  by
    documentary evidence, the  signatures  on  the  appellant's  employment
    letters being relatively similar in my view as they appeared  to  Judge
    James and not sufficient to show that the appellant was not employed in
    Sudan.

25. What impact does the fact of the Immigration Rules being found to  have
    been met have on the weight to be attributed to the public interest  in
    the proportionality assessment?

26. The head note of Mostafa states:

         "In the case of appeals brought against refusal of entry  clearance
         under Article  8  ECHR,  the  claimant's  ability  to  satisfy  the
         Immigration Rules is not the  question  to  be  determined  by  the
         Tribunal,  but  is  capable  of  being  a   weighty,   though   not
         determinative,  factor  when  deciding  whether  such  refusal   is
         proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  enforcing  immigration
         control (my emphasis)."

27. But Adjei says something different at paragraph 2 of the head note:

         "2. As compliance with para 41 of HC 395 is not a ground of  appeal
         to be decided by the Tribunal, any findings  concerning  that  will
         carry little weight, especially if based  upon  arguments  advanced
         only by the appellant. If  the  appellant  were  to  make  a  fresh
         application for entry clearance the ECO will, if  requested  to  do
         so, have regard to the assessment carried out by the judge but will
         not be bound by those findings to treat the appellant as  a  person
         who,  at  least  at  the  date  of  the  appeal  hearing,  met  the
         requirements of paragraph 41 (my emphasis)."

28. Adjei does not say that no weight arises  from  an  assessment  of  the
    Immigration Rules are met, however,

         "If Article 8 is engaged, the Tribunal may  need  to  look  at  the
         extent to which the claimant is said to have  failed  to  meet  the
         requirements  of   the   rule   because   that   may   inform   the
         proportionality  balancing  exercise  that  must  follow.   Mostafa
         (Article 8 in  entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  112  (IAC)  is  not
         authority for any contrary proposition."

    This seems to provide some scope, albeit limited by  the  reference  to
    "little weight" above, for a situation where there  is  no  failure  in
    fact to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rule.

29. It seems to me that some weight must attract to the appellant if he can
    show to my satisfaction that he did,  in  fact,  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules at the date of  the  decision.  The  Immigration  Rules  are  the
    respondent's expression of what constitutes the public interest by  way
    of effective immigration control. What I take from the case law is that
    an assessment that the Immigration Rules were,  in  fact,  met  cannot,
    without significantly or exceptionally more, lead to the decision being
    disproportionate.

30. It is my judgement that there is more here and  that  this  is  a  very
    compelling  situation  indeed.  The  appellant  is  the   only   person
    identified by the specialist team in the UK as a donor for his brother.
    Everything is ready for his visit in order to proceed to  a  transplant
    operation. His brother's quality of life will be significantly enhanced
    as a result. All those concerned indicate in their evidence,  including
    the medical team, that they are entirely aware of the  importance  that
    the procedure must be completed  within  the  6  month  period  of  the
    appellant's entry clearance and of the imperative that he return at the
    end of that period.

31.  For  those  reasons,  I  find  that  the   decision   amounts   to   a
    disproportionate interference with the family life of the appellant and
    sponsor and allow the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

Decision

32. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set aside.

33. I re-make the appeal, allowing it under Article 8 ECHR  to  the  extent
    that the appellant has shown that he was entitled to entry clearance as
    a family visitor.
