Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representation


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application  for  permission  to  appeal  was  made  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer but nonetheless for the purposes of this  decision  I
    shall refer to the parties as they were described before the First-tier
    Tribunal, that is Mrs Bayat as the appellant and  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer as the respondent.

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer challenges, with permission,  the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins who allowed the appellant's  appeal
    against a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer on 18th February 2015
    to reject her application for entry clearance to join her spouse.

 3. The appellant was refused entry clearance as the partner  of  a  person
    present and settled in the United Kingdom because the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that the application dated 7th November  2014
    met the financial requirements of Appendix FM,  this  was  because  the
    application was not evidenced in accordance with Appendix FM-SE,  which
    sets out the specified evidence the appellant would need to provide  to
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules.

 4. The Entry Clearance  Officer  recorded  that  the  appellant's  sponsor
    claimed he had been employed by Tesco Express as a  customer  assistant
    since June 2013 and was earning an annual gross income  before  tax  of
    �11,953.  The Entry Clearance Officer also noted that  the  appellant's
    sponsor had stated that he was employed by China  Gardens  since  April
    2014 and was earning an annual gross income before tax of �7,272.   The
    Entry Clearance Officer set out the requirements in respect of salaried
    employment such as the production of wage slips covering  a  six  month
    period prior to the date of the application, a letter from the employer
    and personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period  as  the
    wage slips  stating  that  these  documents  were  required  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  An Entry  Clearance  Manager's  decision  was  also
    submitted in response to the grounds of appeal  by  the  appellant  and
    this noted that the net salary payments from the sponsor's job at China
    Garden were not replicated on the sponsor's bank statements because the
    salary was paid in cash.  The Entry Clearance Officer  noted  that  the
    sponsor's salary from China Garden may have been paid in cash but  that
    should have been deposited in the bank  and  no  explanation  had  been
    given why it was not so.

 5. At this point it is convenient to set out relevant sections of Appendix
    FM-SE and in particular Appendix FM-SE.D. sets out as follows:

         "(a) In deciding an application in relation to which this  Appendix
             states that specified documents must be  provided,  the  Entry
             Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the  first  decision
             maker") will consider documents that had been  submitted  with
             the application, and will only  consider  documents  submitted
             after the application where subparagraph (b) or (e) applies:

         (b)  If the applicant -

             (i)  Has submitted:

                  (aa) A sequence of documents and some of the documents  in
                      the sequence have been  omitted  (e.g.  if  one  bank
                      statement from a series is missing);

                  (bb) A document in the wrong format  (for  example,  if  a
                      letter is not on letterhead paper as specified);

                  (cc) A document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                      document; or

                  (dd)  A  document  which  does  not  contain  all  of  the
                      specified information; or

             (ii) Has not submitted a specified document,

                  The  decision-maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
                  representative in writing or otherwise,  and  request  the
                  document(s)  or  the  correct  version(s).   The  material
                  requested must be received.... at the address specified in
                  the request within a reasonable timescale specified in the
                  request.

                  ...

         (e)  Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there  is  a  valid
             reason why a specified document(s) cannot  be  supplied,  e.g.
             because it is not issued in a particular country or  has  been
             permanently lost, he or she may  exercise  discretion  not  to
             apply the  requirement  for  the  document(s)  or  to  request
             alternative  or  additional  information  or  document(s)   be
             submitted by the applicant."

 6. In addition, inter alia, Appendix FM-SE. A.1..1.(k) (m) and  (n)  state
    that:

         "(k) where the gross (pre-tax)  amount  of  any  income  cannot  be
             properly evidenced, the net (post-tax) amount will be counted,
             including towards the gross income requirement...";

          ...

          (m) cash income, on which the correct tax has  been  paid  may  be
             counted as income under this Appendix, subject to the relevant
             evidential requirements of this Appendix...;

         (n)  the gross amount of any cash income may be counted  where  the
             person's specified bank statements show the net  amount  which
             relates to the gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the
             relevant  specified  evidence  provided  in  addition  to  the
             specified  bank  statements  in  relation  to   non-employment
             income).   Otherwise,  only  the  net  amount  shown  on   the
             specified bank statements may be counted."

 7. The grounds of appeal stated that at 9(d) of her decision the Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal found that the sponsor's  wages  from  his  job
    with China Garden were paid in cash and the sponsor used some  of  this
    cash for day-to-day expenses and rent, paying the  remainder  into  his
    bank account.  It was submitted by the Secretary  of  State  that  only
    wages paid into a bank account and appearing on the statements  may  be
    counted towards the sponsor's  gross  income  in  accordance  with  the
    evidence of financial requirement (1)(n) of  Appendix  FM-SE.   It  was
    specifically noted that the gross amount of any cash  income  could  be
    counted where the person's specified bank  statements  showed  the  net
    amount which related to the gross amount on their  payslips,  otherwise
    only the net amount shown on  the  specified  bank  statements  may  be
    counted.

 8. Evidential flexibility, according to the  grounds  of  appeal  did  not
    apply as the omission of evidence did not  fall  within  the  scope  of
    Appendix  FM-SE.D(c).   In  any  event,  FM-SE1(n)  was   a   mandatory
    requirement and the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had  no  discretion  to
    disregard it.

 9. It was not open to the judge to draw his or her own conclusion based on
    the credibility of the sponsor or  on  the  basis  of  other  documents
    provided such as a P60 in the absence of those specified documents.

10. Mr Bramble submitted the judge's findings at 9(g) of her decision  were
    in error as the salary slips needed to be shown.  This was not  a  case
    of evidential flexibility.  The appellant had submitted bank statements
    but the appellant could not comply with the Rules.

11. In allowing the appeal the judge stated the following in  her  decision
    at 9(d) to (h):

         "(d) I accept the appellant's evidence as to how  he  conducts  his
             financial affairs.  Understandably in my judgment, having cash
             in hand, from China Garden every month, he pays both his  rent
             and allocates sufficient cash  for  day-to-day  expenses  from
             this, paying the remainder into his bank  account  by  way  of
             savings.  This is I find, the most sensible modus  vivendi  in
             relation to cash: it would be pointless for the  appellant  to
             have to make a trip to his bank on his China Garden  pay  day,
             complete a paying-in slip and  accurately  count  quite  large
             sums of money to pay in to a cashier, only to  have  to  visit
             the  ATM  every  few  days  to  extract  cash  for  day-to-day
             expenses;

         (e)  I find that what was stated  in  the  appellant's  Grounds  of
             Appeal in relation to his treatment  of  his  pay  from  China
             Garden  (see  above)  does  constitute  an  'explanation'   as
             referred to by the ECM who had said (see  above)  'That  there
             was nothing to prevent the appellant from depositing the money
             in the bank' - indeed, there was nothing I find, save that  it
             would  have  been  a  pointless  and  time  wasting   exercise
             involving a lot of unnecessary trips to the bank to pay in and
             take out cash, when he had received this  from  China  Garden.
             The sensible procedure, would be to spend what  he  needed  on
             day-to-day living and then at the  end  of  the  month  having
             saved what he could, paid that  amount  in  and  this  is  the
             procedure the sponsor adopted and;

         (f)  I find that the sponsor's pay from China Garden is as shown in
             his payslips and that it was properly taxed;

         (g)   I  find  that  the   respondent's   Immigration   Directorate
             Instructions  make  provision  for  wages  paid  in  cash   in
             paragraph A.1.1(m).  Paragraph D(b)(ii) gives  the  respondent
             the following power in relation to applications which on their
             face, would not appear to supply sufficient  documentation  to
             allow the application; 'The  decision-maker  may  contact  the
             applicant or his representative  in  writing  to  request  the
             document'... and (e) of the same paragraph states:

                  'Where a decision-maker is satisfied that there is a valid
                  reason why a specified document(s) cannot  be  supplied...
                  he or  she  may  exercise  discretion  not  to  apply  the
                  requirement or the document or to request  alternative  or
                  additional information or document(s) be submitted by  the
                  applicant'.

             This I find, to be  determinative.   The  provisions  I  find,
             neatly  cover  the  appellant's  inability  to  produce   bank
             statements showing his pay from China Garden as stated in  his
             payslips, reaching his account intact for the valid reason  he
             gave; and would have enabled the decision-maker to  require  a
             P60 for the period in question.  Such would clearly have  been
             available as I have seen a P60 relating to  China  Garden  for
             the next tax year;

         (h)  Accordingly, I find that the fact that the respondent did  not
             avail herself of either of the above options,  to  render  the
             Decision made for the reasons given in the Notice of Decision,
             incorrect.  I find that:

             (i)  The respondent should either have been satisfied with the
                  compelling reason for the absence of  correlation  between
                  bank statement and wage slips  given  in  the  Grounds  of
                  Appeal; or

             (ii) Asked for a relevant P60.

         In the event, an application which but for  this  small  evidential
         point, should have  been  granted,  was  wrongly  in  my  judgment,
         refused."

12. The difficulty with the reasoning of the judge in  relation  to  D  (b)
    (ii) and (e) is that the appellant did  provide  documentation  in  the
    form of bank statements and pay slips and it  was  not  a  question  of
    missing documentation.  The omission did not fall within the  remit  of
    either Appendix  FM-  SE  D(b)  or  (e).   This  is  because  the  bank
    statements were provided. It was not a case as set out that there was a
    specified document not supplied and thus an explanation being  required
    or a further document provided.  The sponsor did  not  pay  his  salary
    into his bank account.  That, however, can be overcome if  the  sponsor
    complied with the requirements which I have identified above  at  FM.SE
    A1.1.

13. Cash income can be taken into account,  see A1.1 (m) but  this  appears
    to be subject to the relevant evidential requirements of  the  Appendix
    and hence, in line with (n), the gross amount of any cash income may be
    counted only where the person's specified bank statements show the  net
    amount which relates to the  gross  amount  shown  on  their  payslips.
    Otherwise only the net amount shown on the  specified  bank  statements
    may be counted.

14. It was  not  clear  that  the  net  amounts  on  the  appellant's  bank
    statements related to his payslips  and  on  this  the  judge  made  no
    findings.  Indeed it  would  appear  from  the  judge's  decision  that
    varying amounts were removed from the cash  prior  to  being  deposited
    into the account.

15. I therefore find an error of law and set aside the decision.

16. The difficult with the appellant's case is that a letter  was  produced
    from the sponsor's accountants,  namely  Accountancy  Services  Limited
    dated 13 October 2014 and prior to the  application  dated  7  November
    2014 confirming  that  the  sponsor's  total  annual  income  from  two
    employments included �11,953 from Tesco and �7,272  from  China  Garden
    but the bank statements cash deposits bore no relation to the  payslips
    from China Garden which were  provided  in  respect  of  China  Garden.
    There was no correlation between the net payments on the payslips which
    identified net payments of �485.47 (x2), �485.27 (x2), and �481.60, and
    the deposits of cash in the bank statements.  This, as I have found, is
    a requirement under (m) and (n), the parts of the Appendix FM-SE  which
    deal with cash income.

17. Even if FM-SE.A1.1.(k) were to be read  separately  and  included  cash
    income it states that where the gross  pre-tax  amount  of  any  income
    cannot be properly evidenced the net post-tax amount will  be  counted.
    Not only is there a P60 submitted running from April 2014 to April 2015
    which shows the sponsor only earned �3,028.68 from China Garden but the
    payslips produced show a net income of just under  �2,500.   On  either
    basis, if the net income is taken into account, the sponsor is  earning
    just under the region of �15,000 and cannot  comply  with  the  �18,600
    income requirement and therefore his appeal must fail.  A  letter  from
    China Garden I note identified that the  appellant  had  departed  that
    employment in November 2014.  This  does  not  assist  his  claim  when
    viewed in the light of the P60.

Notice of Decision

The Judge erred materially for the reasons  identified.   I  set  aside  the
decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals   Courts   and
Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision under section  12(2)
(b) (ii) of the TCE 2007.  The  appeal  of  Mrs  Neelab  Bayat  against  the
decision of the Entry Clearance Officer is dismissed.
