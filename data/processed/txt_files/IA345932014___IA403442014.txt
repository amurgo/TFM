Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr.  J. Reynolds of Counsel, Buckingham Legal
Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr. T. Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The First Appellant, who was born on 10 February 1987, is a national of
    Pakistan. She arrived in the United Kingdom as a student in  2012.   On
    25 January 2013 she met the Second Appellant on a train.  He  had  been
    born in Lithuania on 28 October 1989. They married at  Camden  Registry
    Office on 3 March 2014. She then applied for a  residence  card  on  27
    March 2014.  The Respondent arranged for a  marriage  interview  to  be
    conducted in Liverpool on 27 August 2014.  At that interview the Second
    Appellant did not request an interpreter.  He later said that he  could
    not understand his interviewer because of his  Liverpudlian  accent.  I
    accept that it is clear from  the  interview  record  that  the  Second
    Appellant asked for clarification about what he was being  asked  on  a
    substantial number of occasions.

 2. The First Appellant was refused a residence card on that  same  day  on
    the basis that her  marriage  was  one  of  convenience.  It  was  also
    asserted that she had not provided any audited accounts or confirmation
    of payment of taxes for her husband, who was said to be  self-employed.
    In addition, it was said that he could not answer a number of questions
    about his alleged self-employment. She was then   served with notice of
    removal under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, as  an
    overstayer.

 3. On the same day, the Second Appellant was served with notice of removal
    under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999,  as  a  person
    whose removal was justified on the grounds of an abuse of EEA rights in
    accordance with regulation 21B(2) of the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006.

 4. The First Appellant appealed on 4 September 2014.  In  her  grounds  of
    appeal she asserted that she should not have been served with notice of
    removal as she still had an outstanding  application  for  a  residence
    card as the spouse of an EEA national.  She also submitted  that  there
    were only slight discrepancies between the account given by herself and
    her husband during their marriage interviews.

 5. The Second Appellant appealed on 9 October 2014. He asserted  that  his
    notice of removal was defective as no reasons had been  given  for  the
    decision to remove him.  He also submitted  that  no  reason  had  been
    given for inviting him and his wife to a marriage  interview  and  that
    they had not been provided with copies of the marriage interviews.   In
    addition, he asserted that the initial burden lay on the Respondent  to
    establish that theirs was a marriage of convenience.

 6. Their appeals came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Jerromes,  who
    dismissed their appeals in a decision and  reasons  promulgated  on  10
    February 2015.  She found that the Appellants had  lived  at  the  same
    address and continued to do so but also found that this  was  a  shared
    house and that there was no evidence of any shared  private  or  social
    life.  In addition, she found that the Second Appellant had  only  been
    self-employed for one month. She also found  that  the  Appellants  had
    entered into a marriage of convenience.

 7. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted them permission  to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal on 5 May 2015.  He found  that  it  was  arguable
    that in the absence of a finding by the First-tier Tribunal Judge  that
    the record of the interviews was reliable, she  had  erred  in  placing
    weight on it.

 8. At the error of law hearing counsel for the Appellants  submitted  that
    the record of the interviews should not be relied  upon  because  there
    were discrepancies between its content and the content of  the  refusal
    letter and some of the questions  appeared  to  be  missing.  The  Home
    Office Presenting Officer relied on the fact that there  were  numerous
    discrepancies in  the  marriage  interviews  and  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge had also had the benefit of hearing oral evidence.

 9. The Second Appellant asserted that she was  asked  a  large  number  of
    questions in her part of the marriage interview but the transcript only
    indicates that questions 678 to 853  were  addressed  to  her  and  the
    others were addressed to the  Second  Appellant.   The  fact  that  the
    transcript may not contain  the  totality  of  her  interview  is  also
    supported by the fact that the Second Appellant was asked  questions  1
    to 705 but her questions began at 678. The refusal letter also  asserts
    that she said in interview that they paid ï¿½850 a month in rent but this
    is not appear in the transcript of her interview.  In addition, in  the
    refusal letter the First Appellant is said to have explained  that  her
    husband knew her ring size as she had normal sized fingers but  in  the
    transcript of her interview when asked how her husband would have known
    her ring size, she replied that "because I am  normal  height  so  it's
    just I think he guessed it".  All of  this  brings  into  question  the
    accuracy of the transcript.

10. Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer had also applied for an adjournment of the  appeal  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge because he was concerned about the transcript
    but that his request  had  been  refused.  The  Record  of  Proceedings
    indicates that 40 minutes into the hearing the Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer did apply for an adjournment  as  he  wanted  to  make  further
    investigations about the transcript of the interviews. He did  not  say
    that he accepted that the record of the  interview  had  been  tampered
    with but did say that if the hearing proceeded it would be open to  the
    Appellants to argue that it had been or that the full  record  had  not
    been provided.

11. In the decision letter the Respondent had relied on the content of  the
    marriage interviews to establish that the Appellants had entered into a
    marriage of convenience. However, at the hearing her own representative
    was concerned enough about the record to seek an adjournment. The First-
    tier Tribunal Judge did consider the interview record in  paragraph  25
    of her decision and reasons and noted  that  it  was  "clear  from  the
    answers  given  by  the  2nd  Appellant  that  he  had  difficulty   in
    understanding the questions put to him and often asks for questions  to
    be repeated" but then continues in the next paragraph to  make  adverse
    credibility findings on the basis of his answers.

12. This raises serious questions about whether the Appellants had  a  fair
    hearing. In addition, as the Respondent had relied on the transcript to
    found  her  assertion  that  they  had  entered  into  a  marriage   of
    convenience, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  needed  to  make  a  clear
    finding as to whether the transcript  could  be  relied  upon  and  she
    failed to do so.

13. It is clear from Papajorgj  (EEA  spouse  -  marriage  of  convenience)
    Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC) that there is no burden at the outset of
    an application to demonstrate that a marriage to an EEA national is not
    one of convenience. The burden lies on  the  Respondent.  In  addition,
    once this burden has been met an appellant has to rebut any  assertion.
    In this case the Appellant's ability to do so was  jeopardised  by  the
    Second Appellant's inability to understand the questions put to him and
    the possibility, which was  accepted  by  the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer, that the transcript was not a complete one.

Conclusions

1.   The decision and reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge contained  errors
    of law and should be set aside.

Directions

1.   The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Jerromes is set aside.

2.   The appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de  novo
    hearing before a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Jerromes.
