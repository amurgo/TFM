1.    Funds are "available" to a claimant at the material time if  they  are
    under his control in an overseas bank account.

2.    Though, as is clear from Pankina v SSHD [2010] EWCA  Civ  719,  policy
    guidance that has not been laid before Parliament before the  inception
    of the Points-Based System cannot be relied  on  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, it can give rise to a legitimate expectation that the  Secretary
    of State will adhere to that guidance when considering  an  appellant's
    claim.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellants are  nationals  of  Malawi.   The  first  appellant  is
    married to the second appellant and the third appellant is their son.

2.    The first appellant entered the United Kingdom  on  6  May  2005  with
    entry clearance as a working holidaymaker.  Her leave was  subsequently
    varied and extended permitting her to remain as  a  student,  the  last
    period of leave being granted on 27 June 2008 until 30 June 2009.   The
    second appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2001 and
    was given leave to enter until 21 October  2002  as  a  student.   That
    leave was extended on a number of occasions the most  recent  extension
    being until 21 March 2007.  He and the first  appellant  married  on  8
    October 2006 in Malawi, and on 25 April  2007  the  second  appellant's
    leave was varied and extended until 30 June 2008 as  the  spouse  of  a
    student, and that leave was again extended until 30 June  2009  on  the
    same terms.  The third appellant was born in the United  Kingdom  on  8
    April and was granted leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  from  27
    September 2008 until 30 June 2009 as the child of a student

3.    On 29 June 2009 all three appellants  applied  for  further  leave  to
    remain, the first appellant for leave to remain as a Tier  4  (General)
    Student and the second and  third  appellants  applying  for  leave  to
    remain as respectively her spouse and her dependent child.   The  first
    appellant proposed to study for  a  BA  (Honours)  degree  in  business
    management at the Lighthouse Business College in Manchester, the course
    to commence on 1 September 2008 and end on the  31  August  2010.   The
    course fees were �4,000 of which she had paid �500 and she  had  �1,200
    towards the cost of her maintenance for a two month period.

4.    In a covering letter together with  her  application  form  the  first
    appellant said that in around October 2008  she  had  returned  to  the
    United Kingdom from a visit to Malawi at which time  she  had  US$9,600
    and �650 to provide for her and for the other  appellants'  maintenance
    until June 2009.  She said: "At the moment we have an  extremely  [sic]
    shortage of foreign currency in my country, so its not been possible to
    send any amount more than $1,000 as a result, we have been asking those
    that wished to send money to Malawi to give us here and have the  money
    given to them or their relatives back home in our local currency".  She
    also submitted a letter from a Dr R J Gombwa under  the  letterhead  of
    the Chitawira Private Hospital in which  he  said  he  was  willing  to
    continue his financial support for the first appellant and  her  family
    while she was studying in  the  United  Kingdom.    Statements  of  the
    account of the hospital were submitted.

5.    The application was refused on 10 August 2009 on the  basis  that  the
    Secretary of State was not satisfied that the first appellant qualified
    for 10 points under Appendix C of HC 395 and noted that there was a gap
    of more than a month between the date on which  the  first  appellant's
    current leave had expired (30 June 2009) and  the  date  on  which  the
    course  at  the  Lighthouse  Business  College,  Manchester  began   (1
    September 2009).  With regard to the former, it was considered the that
    first appellant had to show that she  had  access  to  funds  totalling
    �6,300 made up of her  outstanding  course  fees  of  �3,500,  her  own
    maintenance for two months at �600 a month and the maintenance  of  the
    second and third appellants for a period of  two  months  at  �400  per
    month for each of them.  The bank statements she  had  produced  showed
    only �3,269.97, and the letter from Dr Gombwa did not  assist,  because
    the  published  Guidance  permitted  "third  party"  support  only   in
    specified circumstances, none of which applied.

6.    The appellants appealed against this  decision,  and  the  appeal  was
    heard by an Immigration Judge in January 2010.  The judge dismissed the
    appeal, agreeing with the Secretary of State's decisions in  each  case
    and also dismissing an appeal  under  Article  8.   He  noted  evidence
    produced to him from the Chitawira Hospital and  also  evidence  of  an
    account in the joint names of the first and second appellants  covering
    the period 4 June to 17 August 2009 showing a credit balance on 20 June
    2009 of the equivalent of nearly �35,000.   The  appellants  said  that
    they had applied for permission to cover the  transfer  of  funds  from
    their account with the National Bank of Malawi to  the  United  Kingdom
    but had only been granted permission to transfer a total  of  US$1,000.
    They had been able to obtain sterling in the United Kingdom  by  making
    arrangements with individuals who wished to remit funds to  Malawi  and
    who would give them the funds in sterling and the appellants  had  then
    transferred  funds  from  their  account  in  Malawi  to  the  intended
    beneficiaries. They had no documentary  evidence  to  attest  to  these
    transfers.  They were obliged to effect these transfers  because  there
    was a lack of foreign exchange in Malawi.  The Immigration Judge was of
    the view, in respect of the requirement of paragraph 11 of table  C  of
    HC 395, that funds in  sterling  had  to  be  available  and  the  same
    requirement existed in Appendix E.   He did not consider  that  it  was
    possible to equate the having  of  funds  in  Malawi  with  them  being
    available to the individual  concerned  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    evidence did not  show  that  on  23  June  2009  (since  the  date  of
    application was 29 June 2009, we think he must, or should,  have  meant
    that date) there was on that particular  day  a  sufficient  demand  by
    people wishing to send funds to Malawi to show that  on  that  day  the
    appellants could have obtained in sterling the  sums  required.    They
    had not received such sums in sterling bearing that date as the  credit
    balances on their  accounts  showed,  and  the  subsequent  history  of
    payments out of the account of the National Bank of Malawi did not show
    that they had then received sums of that order and  magnitude  on  that
    day.

8.    As regards the other issue, he considered  that  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX of HC 395  were  fulfilled  on  his  interpretation  of
    section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

9.    The appellants sought permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    arguing that they had no notice of the amounts referred to having to be
    shown for the purposes of the appeal, but  the  Immigration  Judge  had
    relied upon factors which had not been relied on by  the  Secretary  of
    State.  Permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis  that  it  was
    appropriate for the Tribunal to consider the distinction drawn  by  the
    judge between having funds and  having  funds  available  and  also  to
    consider whether the judge was correct in  his  interpretation  of  the
    requirement that not more than a month should lapse between the end  of
    an applicant's current leave and the beginning of the course  on  which
    he or she had enrolled.

10.   The hearing before us took  place  on  23  July  2010.   Mr  S  Karim,
    instructed by Zaidi Solicitors, appeared on behalf  of  the  appellant.
    Mr C Avery appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State.

11. We consider first the issue of the availability of  funds.   The  first
    appellant in order to succeed requires to qualify for 10  points  under
    Appendix C of HC 395.   There it is stated  at  paragraph  11  that  10
    points will only be awarded if the funds shown in the table  below  are
    available to the applicant and the  applicant  provides  the  specified
    documents to show this.  The Secretary of State's calculation was  that
    the appellant needed to show over �6,700 for herself and the second and
    third appellants, although the Immigration Judge's calculation was that
    a total of �11,900 needed to be shown.  That difference  is  irrelevant
    if it is possible to take  into  account  the  sums  of  money  in  the
    National Bank of Malawi account in the joint names  of  the  first  and
    second appellants which on the date of application, 29 June  2009,  (or
    at least on the closest date of 20 June 2009) shows the  equivalent  of
    �34,901.89.   The Immigration Judge took account of what  was  said  in
    the policy guidance which  contained  certain  requirements  respecting
    "money needed".  It is however clear from the decision of the Court  of
    Appeal in Pankina v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 719 that policy guidance which
    has not been laid before Parliament before the inception of the  points
    based system cannot be relied on by the Secretary of State as a  source
    of additional mandatory requirements not otherwise spelled out  in  the
    Immigration Rules themselves.  Accordingly the reliance on the guidance
    by the Immigration Judge in this case was an error of law.

12. It is necessary therefore to  look  at  the  wording  of  the  relevant
    Immigration Rule  to  see  whether  the  appellants  can  satisfy  that
    requirement.   Paragraph 11 of Appendix C states in part as follows:




   |                                                             |       |
|11.10 Points will only be awarded if the funds shown in the  |       |
|table below are available to the applicant and the appellant |       |
|provides the specified documents to show this.  Notes to     |       |
|accompany the table appear below the table. (31.3.2009 HC    |       |
|314)                                                         |       |
|                                                             |       |
|Criterion                                                    |Points |
|                                                             |       |
|If studying in inner London:                                 |10     |
|                                                             |       |
|(i) Where the applicant does not have an established presence|       |
|studying in the United Kingdom, the applicant must have funds|       |
|amounting to the full course fees for the first academic year|       |
|of the course, or for the entire course if it is less than a |       |
|year long, plus �800 for each month of the course up to a    |       |
|maximum of nine months                                       |       |
|                                                             |       |
|(ii) Where the applicant has an established presence studying|       |
|in the United Kingdom, the applicant must have funds         |       |
|amounting to the course fees required either for the         |       |
|remaining academic year if the applicant is applying part-way|       |
|through, or for the next academic year if the applicant will |       |
|continue or commence a new course at the start of the next   |       |
|academic year, or for the entire course if it is less than a |       |
|year long, pus �800 for each month of the course up to  a    |       |
|maximum of two months.                                       |       |
| .....                                                       |       |


      The difficulty envisaged by the Immigration Judge with regard  to  the
    question of availability of the funds was that,  as  we  have  set  out
    above, the appellants had only been granted permission  to  transfer  a
    total of the equivalent of US$1,000 to the United Kingdom  from  Malawi
    due  to  exchange  control  regulations  in  Malawi.   They  had   made
    arrangements to obtain sterling in the United  Kingdom  through  people
    who wished to remit funds to Malawi who would give them  the  funds  in
    sterling and there would then be a transfer by  the  first  and  second
    appellants of funds from  their  account  in  Malawi  to  the  intended
    beneficiaries.

13.   We see no reason why we should not conclude  that  a  person  who  has
    funds under his control in an overseas bank  account  has  those  funds
    available to him for the purposes of the Immigration Rules.   Certainly
    the restriction on which the Immigration Judge  concentrated  of  there
    being shown to be on the relevant date people who would transfer  funds
    to the appellants in the way in which they have been carrying out these
    transactions must fall away in light of his reliance in that regard  on
    the policy.  There is no similar restriction on the meaning of the word
    "available" at paragraph 11 of Appendix C.  Clearly the appellants  had
    the ability to circumvent the Malawian exchange control regulations  in
    the manner in which they said they did, but it does not seem to us that
    we  can  apply  a  limitation  on  the  general  meaning  of  the  word
    "available" in some such way as stating the funds  were  not  available
    because they could not immediately access them due to  Malawi  exchange
    control regulations.   We are satisfied that on a proper interpretation
    of the word "available" at paragraph 11 of Appendix  C,  the  necessary
    funds were available to the appellants.

14.   Further or in the alternative, we do not consider that the  appellants
    are precluded from relying upon the guidance which, though  as  Pankina
    makes clear, cannot be employed adversely to an appellant, nevertheless
    in our view  can  give  rise  to  a  legitimate  expectation  that  the
    Secretary of State will adhere to that  guidance  when  considering  an
    appellant's claim.   As is pointed out by  Mr  Karim  in  his  skeleton
    argument, the Tier 4 guidance states that the proof of availability  of
    funds can be shown by bank statements including  overseas  accounts  so
    long as the specified  information  as  set  out  in  the  guidance  is
    declared on the bank statement.  The guidance  does  not  require  that
    funds have to be available in the sense of being immediately accessible
    or otherwise.  Proof of liquid assets in bank accounts is,  in  effect,
    sufficient.  Nor is there any requirement  that  the  funds  should  be
    available for withdrawal or accessible within a specified time  period.
    Bearing these matters in mind, we conclude that even if we are wrong in
    our view that the appellants are entitled to rely upon the  wording  of
    paragraph 11 of Appendix C, in the alternative they  had  a  legitimate
    expectation  that  the  Secretary  of  State  would  deal  with   their
    application in accordance with the wording of the policy  guidance  and
    as a consequence there would be a denial of that legitimate expectation
    if they were not allowed so to rely.  We should  add  that  we  see  no
    merit in this regard to the point taken by  the  Immigration  Judge,  a
    point we adverted to previously, about  the  need  to  be  shown  on  a
    particular day a sufficient demand by persons wishing to send funds  to
    Malawi wishing to demonstrate that on that  day  the  appellants  could
    have obtained in sterling the necessary sums.  On our  reading  of  the
    guidance and the  appellants'  proper  reliance  on  it,  there  is  no
    specific requirement of such matters having to be shown.  It is  simply
    a matter of availability on the  basis  of  the  criteria  set  out  in
    particular at paragraph 37 of the relevant  policy  guidance  which  is
    quoted at paragraph 16 of the Immigration Judge's determination.

15.   We turn  now to the second issue in this appeal which is that  of  the
    application  of  section  3C  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  and  its
    relationship to paragraph 245ZX(l) of HC 395.  The  relevant  parts  of
    section 3C state as follows:

         "3C      Continuation of leave pending variation decision
             (1)    This section applies if -
                  (a)  a person who has limited leave to enter or remain  in
                      the United Kingdom applies to the Secretary of  State
                      for variation of the leave,


                  (b)  the application for  variation  is  made  before  the
                      leave expires, and


                  (c)   the  leave  expires  without  the  application   for
                      variation having been decided.


             (2)       The leave is extended  by  virtue  of  this  section
                  during any period when -


                  (a)  the application for variation is neither decided  nor
                      withdrawn,


                  (b)  an appeal under Section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
                      Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  could  be  brought,
                      while the appellant is in the United Kingdom] against
                      the   decision   for   application   (ignoring    any
                      possibility of an appeal out of time with permission)
                      or


                  (c)  an appeal under that section against  that  decision,
                      brought  while  the  appellant  was  in  the   United
                      Kingdom, is pending within the meaning of Section 104
                      of that Act.


               3) Leave extended by virtue of this Section  shall  lapse  if
                  the applicant leaves the United Kingdom.


             (4)       A person may not make an application  for  variation
                  of his leave to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
                  while that leave is extended by virtue of this section.


             (5)       But subsection (4) does not prevent the variation of
                  the application mentioned in subsection (1)(a).


                 ..."

16.   Paragraph 245ZX(l) states as follows:

         "The applicant must not be applying for leave  to  remain  for  the
         purpose of studies which would commence more than one  month  after
         the  applicant's  current  entry  clearance  or  leave  to   remain
         expires."

17.   The Immigration Judge considered the interplay of these provisions  at
    paragraphs 21 and 22 of his determination.  In his view the  effect  of
    section 3C(2) was that the relevant period of leave was  extended,  and
    since the leave had been statutorily extended, the  effect  of  section
    3C(2) was that the leave did not (after  all)  expire.   He  considered
    that as the first appellant had applied for the variation of her  leave
    before 30 June 2009, the date on which but for the operation of section
    3C her leave would have expired, her  leave  was  extended  by  section
    3C(2) and that leave was continuing, under the same provision,  at  the
    date when her application  was  decided  on  10  August  2009,  it  was
    continuing on 1 September 2009 when her course at the college began and
    would continue for as long as this appeal was pending unless  she  left
    the United Kingdom.  He concluded therefore that  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245ZX were fulfilled.

18.   It is necessary for us to consider this aspect of  the  determination,
    although the Secretary of State did not cross-appeal in respect of  the
    findings in this regard.  We have found the Immigration Judge erred  in
    law in respect of the first issue, and since  the  matter  was  clearly
    flagged up by the Senior Immigration Judge who  granted  permission  to
    appeal, it is a matter that must be addressed.

19.   Since the Immigration Judge's decision we have the  reported  decision
    of the Tribunal in QI (para 245ZX(l) considered) Pakistan  [2010]  UKUT
    217 (IAC).  One of the issues before the Tribunal was the situation  of
    an appellant who had applied on 29 May 2009 for leave to  remain  as  a
    Tier 4 (General) Student.  The course in question was due  to  commence
    on 20 July, and his then current leave to  remain  expired  on  30  May
    2009.

20.   The Tribunal said the following at paragraph 10:

         "10.     I consider the appellant's submissions on this  point  are
             ill-founded. Whilst I would accept  that  the  rule  is  badly
             drafted, it is inescapably clear that 'current  ...  leave  to
             remain' must refer to an  appellant's  substantive  period  of
             limited leave (in the appellant's case, the leave he had  from
             28 May 2008 to 30 May 2009).  Were  the  above  expression  to
             denote Section 3C leave, then time would never  start  to  run
             and the requirement would be  meaningless.   Further,  at  the
             time the applicant made his application, his leave could  only
             have been his substantive leave; his Section  3C  leave  could
             not have come into being until after he received  a  decision.
             That is because Section 3C leave does  not  arise  until  'the
             leave expires without the  application  for  variation  having
             been decided' (Section 3C(c)).  Accordingly the IJ  could  not
             be faulted for concluding that the appellant's proposed course
             was not due to commence until more than one  month  after  his
             leave to remain expired."

21.   In this regard Mr Karim argued that QI was wrong and was not  binding.
     He argued that the one month requirement  was  a  concession  to  help
    students who did not apply in time and they could do so if  the  course
    began within the one month period.  It was there for example to  assist
    a person whose leave expired in the summer term and where there  was  a
    requirement imposed outside the student's control.  The  provision  was
    there for people who  did  not  have  section  3C  leave.   Section  3C
    extended the period while the Secretary of State was making a  decision
    and if at the time of the decision there was still a month between  the
    decision and  the  start  of  the  course  then  the  person  might  be
    unsuccessful but they could succeed if the course began within a month.



22.   Mr Avery argued that paragraph 245ZX had to  be  read  in  conjunction
    with what paragraph 245ZY set out in respect of  courses  of  different
    lengths, the period  of  entry  clearance  to  be  granted  before  the
    beginning of the course and the period of entry clearance to be granted
    after the end of the course.  It was designed to give an appellant  the
    opportunity to reenrol although it should not  be  problematic  as  the
    student should have had leave to take account of the  summer  vacation.
    For example in the case of a course of twelve months or more  a  period
    of entry clearance of four months would be  granted  after  the  course
    ended.  Otherwise a person would have to leave the country and reapply.

23.   We agree with the reasoning of the Tribunal in QI on this  point.  The
    proper interpretation of the phrase "current ... leave  to  remain"  at
    paragraph 245ZQ(l) is that it must be  a  reference  to  a  substantive
    period of limited leave (in the instant case the  leave  from  27  June
    2008 until 30 June 2009) and that was the only leave the appellant  had
    at the time when she made her application.   Her leave under Section 3C
    would not come into being until after  she  had  received  a  decision,
    since such leave only arises when, as it is put  in  section  3C(i)(c),
    the leave expires without the application  for  variation  having  been
    decided.  Accordingly we consider that the Immigration Judge  erred  in
    this regard and although on our interpretation of the Immigration Rules
    she and her dependants, the  second  and  third  appellants,  meet  the
    financial requirements of paragraph 245ZX(d) of  having  the  necessary
    funds available, the appeal must be dismissed on the basis that they do
    not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(l).

24.   There was no challenge to the Immigration Judge's findings in  respect
    of Article 8 of the ECHR, so we need say nothing about that issue.   We
    would say, however that it will  be  for  the  respondent  to  consider
    whether it is appropriate to grant a fresh leave to remain on the basis
    of our findings on the first issue, and  in  the  light  of  up-to-date
    information as to the progress of the first appellant's studies.
