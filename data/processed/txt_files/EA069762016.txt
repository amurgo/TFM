For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Bart-Stewart promulgated on 27 November 2017, in which the  Appellant's
    appeal against the decision  to  refuse  his  application  for  an  EEA
    Residence Card dated 26 May 2016 was dismissed.

 2. I found an error of law in Judge Bart-Stewart's decision promulgated on
    27 November 2017 following the first hearing of this appeal on 30  July
    2018.  The background to this appeal is set out in  the  error  of  law
    decision contained in the annex and will  not  be  repeated  here  save
    where reference to the background facts is needed.   This  decision  is
    the re-making of the appeal.

 3. The issues in the appeal were first, whether  the  Appellant  satisfied
    the requirements for an EEA Residence Card set out in regulation  10(5)
    of the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006;  and
    secondly, whether he had obtained a right of permanent residence  under
    regulation 15 of the same.

 4. The Respondent initially refused the application,  essentially  on  the
    basis that it was not accepted that the EEA  national  sponsor  was  in
    genuine and effective employment prior to or at the date of divorce and
    insufficient evidence that the Appellant was  a  worker,  self-employed
    person or a self-sufficient person since the date of divorce.

 5. At the hearing on 2 November 2018, the Appellant produced a significant
    volume of original payslips and corresponding  bank  statements  and  a
    short adjournment was granted for the Home Office Presenting Officer to
    consider this additional evidence, even thought it  had  been  produced
    exceptionally late and in breach of directions.

 6. Following consideration of the documents, it was accepted on behalf  of
    the Respondent that there was clear evidence of both the Appellant  and
    his EEA national Sponsor working since 2010, up to the date of  divorce
    for the Sponsor and up to the date of hearing for  the  Appellant.   In
    the  circumstances,  there  was  no  longer  any  submission  that  the
    Sponsor's employment was not  genuine  and  effective  (part-time  work
    being sufficient and with sufficient pooled resources  for  the  couple
    from the same business).  It was as a result accepted on behalf of  the
    Respondent that the Appellant had a  retained  right  of  residence  on
    divorce pursuant to regulation 10 of the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 and also that he had obtained a permanent  right
    of residence under regulation 15 of the  same.   There  were  no  other
    outstanding issues in the appeal.

 7. On the basis of the Respondent's acceptance that  the  Appellant  meets
    the relevant requirements of regulation 10 and 15  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006,  I  allow  the  Appellant's
    appeal for those reasons.

Notice of Decision

For the reasons given in my decision promulgated  on  28  August  2018,  the
making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of
a material error of law.   As  such  it  was  necessary  to  set  aside  the
decision.

The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside  and  re-made  as
follows:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Harvey of Counsel, instructed by TMC Solicitors
Ltd
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Bart-Stewart promulgated on 27 November 2017, in which the  Appellant's
    appeal against the decision  to  refuse  his  application  for  an  EEA
    Residence Card dated 26 May 2016 was dismissed.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Palestine, born on 21 December 1991, who
    entered the United Kingdom in 2008, initially claiming asylum which was
    refused in February 2009.  An application for leave  to  remain  on  16
    June 2009 was refused on 22 February 2010.   On  12  January  2012,  he
    applied for an EEA Residence Card on the basis of his  marriage  to  an
    EEA national, which was approved and issued by the Respondent.   On  26
    November 2015, the Appellant made a  further  application  for  an  EEA
    Residence Card to reflect  a  retained  right  of  residence  following
    divorce from his EEA national spouse.

 3. The Respondent refused the application on 26 May 2016 on the basis that
    not all  the  requirements  of  Regulation  10(5)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic) Regulations 2006 (the  EEA  Regulations)  had  been
    met.  Although it is accepted that the Appellant had been married to an
    EEA national and had provided P60s for the financial years ending April
    2013 to 2015 inclusive, it was not accepted that there was genuine  and
    effective employment as the earnings were below  the  Primary  Earnings
    Threshold (PET) and there was no other evidence to demonstrate that the
    employment  was  genuine  and  effective.   In  addition,   there   was
    insufficient evidence to show that the Appellant was  a  worker,  self-
    employed person or a self-sufficient  person  since  the  date  of  his
    divorce as required by Regulation 10(6) of the EEA Regulations.

 4. Judge Bart-Stewart dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 27
    November 2017.  In essence, it was not accepted that the Appellant  had
    established  that  the  EEA  national  was  in  genuine  and  effective
    employment at the date of dissolution of the  marriage  and  exercising
    treaty rights in the  UK.   I  return  below  in  more  detail  to  the
    reasoning given for the conclusion.

The appeal

 5. The Appellant appeals on  the  grounds  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    materially erred in law  in  (i)  failing  to  take  into  account  the
    duration of the EEA national employment when considering whether it was
    genuine and effective;  (ii)  reaching  adverse  findings  against  the
    Appellant without putting the points to  him  and  in  drawing  adverse
    inferences from photocopied documents without  requesting  whether  the
    originals were available; (iii) misdirecting itself  by  proceeding  on
    the basis of a erroneous understanding the material facts  in  evidence
    before him as  the  earnings  of  all  employees  in  the  company  and
    incorrectly identifying the EEA nationals pay; (iv) misdirecting itself
    in failing to provide reasons  for  rejecting  the  evidence  that  all
    employees worked two days and earned similar income;  and  (v)  thereby
    cumulatively erring in the assessment of  whether  the  EEA  national's
    employment was genuine and effective.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Jackson on 12  June  2018  on
    all grounds.

 7. At the oral hearing, Ms Harvey  made  detailed  submissions  about  the
    factual circumstances and  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    which she said were not fully taken into account  when  the  conclusion
    was reached that the EEA national's  employment  was  not  genuine  and
    effective and there was an erroneous understanding of  the  facts.   In
    particular, the First-tier Tribunal found that all employees earned the
    same, however the payslips showed that they  did  not  and  where  some
    employees earned the same wage, this was based on earning the  national
    minimum wage and working same basic hours.  It was accepted that  there
    was no clear evidence of higher pay for the more  highly  skilled  jobs
    undertaken but no reasons were given for rejecting the  business  model
    that all employees worked two days per week.

 8. Further, there was no assessment of the EEA national's pattern of  work
    as a whole.  She had worked 16 hours a week in her previous job,  doing
    the same thing and there had been a consistent number of hours  worked.
    However on closer inspection of the payslips at  the  hearing,  it  was
    accepted that the hours worked were not in fact consistent and  at  the
    beginning of the period of employment did not  amount  to  16  hours  a
    week.  However, the EEA national was replaced by a new employee on  the
    day that she left and the only change in employment circumstances since
    the Appellant was issued with an EEA Residence Card in  2012  was  that
    her employer had changed to being the Appellant.

 9. In terms of the finances of the Appellant and  his  spouse,  they  were
    both earning and lived in a council flat with low outgoings  such  that
    their income was sufficient to live on  and  there  was  no  additional
    employment or sources of income required.  In  all,  it  was  submitted
    that there was sufficient evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    show that the EEA national was employed in genuine and effective work.

10. The adverse inferences which were drawn by the First-tier Tribunal were
    not raised by the Respondent in the reasons for refusal letter and  not
    put to the Appellant in the course of the hearing before the First-tier
    Tribunal.  There was no suggestion that the employment was not genuine,
    that payslips and bank statements did not match up, nor  that  original
    documents had not been provided.

11. In relation to paragraph 13 of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision,  it
    was submitted that the findings there were incorrect on the face on the
    evidence, but both parties were in difficulties as neither had  a  copy
    of the Appellant's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal.  I have  what
    appears to be the complete bundle on file and the parties were  content
    that I examined the factual points against that bundle.  On  one  point
    of detail, my attention was  drawn  to  the  payslips  which  did  show
    cumulative earnings as a year-to-date figure, contrary to  the  finding
    in paragraph 15 of the First-tier Tribunal.

12. On behalf of the Respondent, Ms Isherwood submitted that  the  findings
    reached were open to the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  basis  of  the
    documents and evidence before it and with particular reference  to  the
    lack  of  plausibility  and  consistency  in   those   documents.    In
    particular, the Appellant had failed to give an explanation of the work
    schedules that he submitted and could not explain  why  employees  were
    paid the same regardless of whether they worked or not.  There had  for
    example been no  company  bank  accounts  submitted  and  a  number  of
    documents were inconsistent.





Findings and reasons

13. To determine this appeal, it is necessary to set out in more detail the
    findings made by the First-tier Tribunal and consider these against the
    evidence before  it  submitted  by  the  Appellant.   The  key  factual
    findings are set out in paragraphs 13 to 15 as follows:

         "13.  The sole issue is whether the EEA national was  a  worker  at
         the date of divorce and the appellant also in genuine and effective
         employment.  The relevant date is that of the divorce on  29  April
         2015.  The appellant said that he had his own business in 2012  and
         he and the EEA national worked for the  business.   The  bundle  of
         documents  which  is  large,  consists  mainly  of  photocopies  of
         payslips and P60s.  There are some joint bank statements  for  2011
         to  April  2014  but  those  after  1  August  2013  only   summary
         statements.  There are computer printout statements  stated  to  be
         printed on 17 May 2015 with transactions from 28 July  2014  to  18
         May 2015.  There is no corresponding payslip for  a  credit  on  29
         April 2015.  There are two credits for �450.61 on 4 March 2015  and
         10/2015 which is not  consistent  with  the  amount  shown  on  the
         employee summary and only one payment �437.47 on 1 September 2014.

         14.  The business bank  statements  have  not  been  produced.   In
         evidence the appellant said that the company was set  up  in  March
         2012 and the EEA national began to  work  for  him  in  April  2012
         however  the  Certificate  of   Incorporation   shows   a   company
         incorporated on 28 June 2012.

         15.  I do not consider credible all  employees  regardless  of  the
         skill  and  type  of  trade,  whether  office  worker  or   skilled
         tradesperson, would be paid the same amount,  or  that  all  worked
         only 2 days  a  month  when  there  were  multiple  projects.   The
         appellant's explanation for only paying himself for 2 days  a  week
         is implausible.  His P60 for the tax year ended 5 April 2015 showed
         net pay of �4453.64 and for the EEA national it is �4328.72.   They
         should be the same on his explanation.  These are  photocopies  but
         in any event self-generated.  There is just a selection of payslips
         and none show cumulative pay."

14. The decision goes on to set out the need for work  to  be  genuine  and
    effective, such that part-time work and work below  the  level  of  the
    minimum means of subsistence is not necessarily relevant to a  person's
    status as a worker and all circumstances relating to the nature of  the
    activities in question and employment relationship at issue has  to  be
    taken into account.  The final conclusion is then, as above,  that  the
    Appellant had not  satisfied  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  EEA
    national was in genuine and effective employment at the date of divorce
    and exercising treaty rights in the UK.

15. I note at the outset that the reasons given for the decision  are  very
    brief and essentially seem to amount to a finding that  the  employment
    of the EEA national was not genuine, although this is not expressly  or
    separately articulated.  It also appears that the same finding  extends
    to the Appellant's exercise of treaty  rights  in  the  United  Kingdom
    although the two are somewhat conflated and  no  distinct  reasons  are
    given in relation to the Appellant.  There are also no express findings
    or reasoning as to whether either the Appellant's or the EEA national's
    employment was effective despite the direction in law as to what  needs
    to be taken into account to determine this question.  There is  nothing
    to suggest consideration has been given to the employment relationship,
    the terms  of  employment,  the  employment  history  or  the  couple's
    lifestyle and expenses  compared  to  their  earnings  (and  there  was
    evidence on the latter before the First-tier Tribunal).

16. However, in relation to employment history, the Appellant's claim  that
    the First-tier Tribunal failed to have regard to the consistent  nature
    of the EEA national's employment, said to be for 16 hours a week in her
    previous employment and throughout the four years'  employment  in  the
    Appellant's  business  does  not  withstand  scrutiny.   The   payslips
    provided for the EEA national from September 2012  to  June  2013  show
    43.33 hours a month work, equating to only 10 hours per week  and  only
    increasing to the equivalent of 16 hours per week in August 2013.   The
    P60's provided similarly show significantly lower earnings to the  year
    ending April 2013 compared to later years (around half or less).  It is
    therefore unlikely that this particular point could have  assisted  the
    Appellant even if expressly taken into account.

17. The Appellant also claims that the First-tier Tribunal proceeded on  an
    erroneous factual basis as to the nature of  the  Appellant's  business
    and failed to give adequate reasons for  rejecting  the  evidence  that
    everyone was contracted to work 2 days per week  and  earnt  a  similar
    salary (that being the national minimum wage).  The First-tier Tribunal
    was however entitled to question the plausibility of a  business  where
    skilled tradesman were paid at the same salary as other  employees  and
    find that the explanation provided about the operation of the  business
    was  inadequate.   Sufficient  reasons  were  given  in  light  of  the
    Appellant's evidence on this point.

18. As to the specific challenges on the findings made in paragraphs 13 and
    15, I find that save for the payslips not showing cumulative pay  (they
    do), these findings are all supported by the evidence before the First-
    tier Tribunal.  It is correct that there is  no  corresponding  payslip
    for the credit in the bank account dated 29  April  2014  for  �901.30;
    that credits of �450.61 on 4 March  2015  and  October  2015  were  not
    consistent with the employer summary and that there is only one payment
    of �427.14 on 1 September 2014.  I would also note that  following  the
    agreement during  the  hearing  that  I  would  consider  the  payslip,
    employer summary and bank statements carefully to  check  these  points
    (as the parties did not have a full  copy  of  the  Appellant's  bundle
    before  the   First-tier   Tribunal),   that   the   findings   as   to
    inconsistencies could  have  been  made  much  more  broadly  than  the
    specific examples given in paragraph 13 of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision.  There is for example  a  lack  of  consistency  between  the
    payslips and bank statements and lack of clarity  as  to  who  payments
    from the company are being made to as payments are made to a joint bank
    account.

19. Although the reasons that have been given by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    are, in the main, accurate in relation to the evidence referred to, the
    First-tier Tribunal has materially erred in  law  in  failing  to  make
    adequate or clear  findings  of  fact  necessary  for  the  parties  to
    understand why the appeal was dismissed.  The findings that  were  made
    are too limited and not adequately reasoned or related to the issues in
    the appeal.  There is  a  significant  lack  of  express  and  distinct
    findings on all of the matters required for proper determination of the
    appeal, including as to whether the employment of the EEA national  and
    Appellant's employment was genuine and effective;  which  are  distinct
    issues in this appeal.

20. In addition, the Appellant also relies  upon  two  procedural  fairness
    points, first, that adverse  inferences  were  drawn  from  photocopied
    documents without the originals  being  requested  and  secondly,  that
    discrepancies between payslips and bank credits were  not  put  to  the
    Appellant nor relied upon by the Respondent in the reasons for refusal.
     In relation to the first, I do not find that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    drew any adverse inferences from the fact of itself that payslips  were
    photocopied, which are accurately  described  in  any  event  as  self-
    generated.  It is expressly noted that there are only  a  selection  of
    payslips and that they do not correspond to the  bank  statements  that
    were provided.  Although it is stated that the  payslips  do  not  show
    cumulative pay, in  fact  they  do.   However,  overall,  the  lack  of
    comprehensive and consistent payslips which were in any event generated
    by the Appellant as employer/owner of the business are the  substantive
    basis for this being part of the reasoning as to why the employment was
    not genuine and effective rather than that documents in the bundle were
    photocopies.  The same reasoning would apply to original documents.

21. As  to  the  discrepancies  in  payslips  and  credits  shown  in  bank
    statements and/or in the employee schedule, there is nothing to suggest
    that this point was specifically put to the Appellant during the course
    of the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  I find that  this,  combined  with
    the material error of law already identified above as to  the  lack  of
    comprehensive reasons for dismissing the appeal based on  the  apparent
    view that  has  been  reached  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    employment was not genuine - a point not  expressly  raised  or  relied
    upon by the Respondent, nor put to the Appellant -  does  amount  to  a
    further error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

22. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be  set
    aside and the matter will be relisted for  a  further  hearing  in  the
    Upper Tribunal  to  redetermine  the  appeal.   Although  further  fact
    finding is required, having regard to the overriding objective and  the
    relevant Practice Statement I do not consider that it is  so  extensive
    as to make it appropriate for this appeal to be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal to remake the decision.

23. Subject to any express concession to the contrary  by  the  Respondent,
    the Appellant is on notice that in light of the facts that  were  found
    by the First-tier Tribunal in relation  to  discrepancies  and  limited
    employment documentation, that the  genuineness  and  effectiveness  of
    employment of both the Appellant and the EEA national is in issue

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.



Directions

 A. The Upper Tribunal to provide the Appellant and Respondent with a  copy
