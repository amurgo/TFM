For the Respondent:    Miss G Kiai, Counsel, instructed by J D Spicer Zeb
(87 Kilburn)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Respondent is referred to as the Claimant and  the
    Appellant is referred to as the ECO.

2.   The Claimant, a national of the DRC, appealed against the  decision  of
    the ECO, dated 30 July 2013, to refuse entry clearance for the purposes
    of settlement with reference to paragraph 297 of the Immigration  Rules
    HC 395 as amended.  The  appeal  against  that  adverse  decision  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Wellesley-Cole (the judge) who allowed
    the appeal presumably under paragraph 297 of the Rules.

3.   Permission to appeal that decision was  given  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge A D Baker on 4 March 2015.

4.   The grounds on which permission was sought contain under the heading  '
    Ground 1' (there is no Ground 2) paragraph 2 a recitation of  paragraph
    297 of the Rules which does not of itself identify any  error  of  law.
    The paragraph numbered 3 essentially became the core issue  of  whether
    or  not  the  judge  had  properly   addressed   the   Sponsor's   sole
    responsibility for the Claimant.

5.   It was ultimately a 'reasons' challenge.  The judge was  taken  to  and
    recited various parts of the evidence , the   counter  submissions  and
    ultimately said:-

         "There were Western Union remittances, I appreciate that  financial
         support is not the only criteria. But he did say  in  his  evidence
         (the Sponsor's), which I place  weight  on  as  I  find  it  to  be
         credible, that he took key decisions in relation to her school  and
         science trips and he consulted with the niece."

6.   The niece had been for many years the day-to-day carer of the  Claimant
    and it was a striking feature of this case given that she was  said  to
    have cared for the Claimant since 2003. Yet there was no evidence  from
    her at all other than her claim of being the carer and  confirming  her
    relationship to her uncle, the UK  Sponsor.   There  was  no  evidence,
    other than showing the Claimant's attendance at school in Kinshasa  and
    being signed on to some form of GP surgery in Kinshasa.

7.   There was no evidence of how the funds sent  to  the  niece  have  been
    applied, nothing in relation to how  and  what  the  expenditures  were
    incurred by the Claimant or how they were addressed. The lack  of  such
    evidence had been noted by the ECO and the judge.  Ultimately there was
    a considerable gap in  the  evidence  to  address  the  claim  of  sole
    responsibility and the extent to which the niece had day-to-day care of
    the Claimant.

8.   Having looked carefully at the matters recorded  it  was  also  notable
    that the judge, for example, failed to deal with an issue  in  dispute,
    namely the extent  of the claimed  contact  by  telephone  between  the
    Claimant and the Sponsor: a matter raised  by  the  Presenting  Officer
    but which was never resolved.  This illustrated, as does a fair reading
    of the decision as a whole, that the judge signally failed  to  provide
    adequate and sufficient reasons to  support  the  conclusion  that  the
    Sponsor had sole responsibility for the Claimant.

10.  In the circumstances we have considered whether or not enough has  been
    done by the judge in her findings to save  the  decision.  It  is  with
    great reluctance we have  come  to  the  view  that  quite  simply  the
    failures by the judge had led to an  unsatisfactory  decision.   It  is
    trite law that proper and sufficient reasons must be provided  so  that
    each party to an appeal can understand the basis of the reasons  given,
    a matter the judge did not do.

11,  In these circumstances we find the Original  Tribunal  decision  cannot
    stand.  The Original Tribunal's decision will have to be remade.
