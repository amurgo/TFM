Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Hussain, Solicitor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as described above but are referred to in the  rest  of
    this determination as  they  were  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The
    appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against refusal of entry
    clearance as a wife and child under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The applications were based  on  the  sponsor's  claimed  gross
    income from self-employment in a takeaway food business of �11,405  per
    annum and claimed employment at �12,000 per annum.   The  ECO  said  in
    each refusal decision:

         ... the bank statements provided do not satisfactorily reflect  the
         claimed salary, which means I am not satisfied that your sponsor is
         employed as indicated.  I therefore refuse your  application  under
         paragraph EC-C.1.1(d) of Appendix FM ... (E-ECC.3.1).

 2. In his determination promulgated on 1st September  2014  allowing  both
    appeals Designated Judge Macdonald said at paragraph 20:

         ... I have from the sponsor an explanation  of  how  he  earns  his
         money and how that money is at the necessary limit set out  in  the
         Rules.  He has shown that he is paid sufficient money in  terms  of
         the Rules and explained that he has not always put that money which
         he has paid directly into his bank account.  Against  that  it  can
         clearly be seen from the bank  statement  referred  to  above  that
         there is a direct correlation between his earnings  as  stated  and
         the sums deposited in his bank.

 3. The ECO appeals to the Upper  Tribunal  on  grounds  which  quote  that
    paragraph of the determination and continue thus:

         5. ... the  Tribunal  has  materially  misdirected  itself  ...  in
             finding that the evidence of the sponsor was sufficient  under
             Appendix FM-SE.   The sponsor states that he does not pay  all
             of his earnings into his bank account and  therefore  ...  the
             ECO can only take into account in  calculating  the  sponsor's
             finances the amount that has  been  deposited  into  the  bank
             account.   While  the  Tribunal  might  accept  the  sponsor's
             explanation ... the appellant does not meet  the  requirements
             of Appendix FM-SE for the financial requirements ...

         6. The Rules ... comprehensively set out ... what types of evidence
             are required, the periods they cover and the format that  they
             should  be  in  ...  the  Tribunal's  ...  findings  are   ...
             unsustainable.

 4. Mrs O'Brien directed my attention to the Rules at Appendix FM-SE-family
    members-specified  evidence.   Paragraph  2  requires  in  respect   of
    salaried employment in the UK various evidence all  of  which  must  be
    provided including (a) wage slips and:

         (c) personal bank statements corresponding to the same  periods  as
         the wage slips ... showing that the salary has been  paid  into  an
         account in the name of the person or in the name of the person  and
         their partner jointly.

    Paragraph 7 requires in respect of self-employment in the  UK  all  the
    various items of evidence including tax returns and:

         (f) personal bank statements for the same twelve  month  period  as
         the tax returns showing that the income  from  self-employment  has
         been paid into an account in the name of the person or in the  name
         of the person and their partner jointly.

 5. Mrs O'Brien submitted that evidence had to be in  the  forms  specified
    and could not be made good by oral or  other  evidence  no  matter  how
    convincing.  The underlying point was for the ECO to be  able  to  find
    corroboration of the income.  While the case might be a sympathetic one
    the judge had gone wrong by  accepting  oral  explanations  which  were
    simply irrelevant.

 6. Mr Hussain submitted that the appellants had shown that  the  sponsor's
    income was reflected in full by the payments into the  bank  statement.
    Although the deposits were not in the exact amount claimed,  which  was
    �756.98 per month, there were deposits each month  of  more  than  that
    amount.  The appellant was paid in cash and when he put the funds  into
    the bank he rounded the amounts up.  In  no  instance  was  the  amount
    deposited less than claimed.  All the other documents required  by  the
    Rules had been provided.  The  evidence  did  not  have  to  show  that
    payments were made by transfer from one bank account to  another.   The
    fact that the appellant had a  second  source  of  income  led  to  the
    rounding up from cash  in  hand.   Mr  Hussain  accepted  that  if  the
    deposits had been of a lesser amount in any instance  that  would  have
    been fatal to the case, but not where the amounts were rounded up.

 7. I reserved my determination.

 8. The scheme of Appendix FM-SE is detailed and prescriptive.   I  do  not
    doubt that Tribunals must apply it according to its terms.  There is no
    scope for judges to be satisfied by evidence not of a nature  specified
    in the Rules.  However the wording of the Rules does  not  insist  that
    income must be traceable by bank-to-bank transfers  of  exact  amounts.
    Any such requirement would have to be in the Rules.   As  I  understood
    the submission for the ECO, it was accepted that if the  appellant  had
    taken the exact amount in cash to the bank and deposited it, that would
    be satisfactory.

 9. The ECO's grounds of appeal  are  based  on  the  conception  that  the
    sponsor "does not pay all of  his  earnings  into  his  bank  account".
    However,  as  portrayed  in  the  determination  at  paragraph  19   in
    particular and in the submissions made in the First-tier Tribunal there
    is no evidence that the deposits in the bank account ever fell short of
    the income claimed - which  Mr  Hussain  correctly  accepted  would  be
    fatal.  Rather, the deposits are in excess of the amount  claimed,  and
    so are consistent with all earnings being paid in.  The grounds  accept
    that the ECO could take account of those sums which were deposited.

10. The judge did not think that  this  was  a  case  where  the  financial
    requirements were met by evidence other  than  that  specified  in  the
    Rules.  His view was that, properly considered, the bank statements did
    show the income was paid into the account.  Deposits in excess, whether
    made separately or together with the amounts claimed, could not detract
    from that.

11. I do not find the grounds to disclose any  error  of  law.   The  Rules
    required the appellant to show that salary and income  were  paid  into
    the bank account.  The Judge found that his evidence  showed  precisely
    that and did not find the financial  requirements  to  be  met  by  any
    evidence going outside the Rules.  The determination of the  First-tier
    Tribunal shall stand.
