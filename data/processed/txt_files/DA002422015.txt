For the Respondent:    Ms L Appiah of Counsel instructed by Charles Ete &
Co Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and to avoid confusion I shall refer to her as  being,  "the
    claimant".

2.   The respondent is a citizen of Nigeria, who was born on 10th  November,
    1960.  He first entered the United Kingdom on 15th September, 1989,  on
    a visit visa, and was granted leave for six months.  On 28th  February,
    1989, solicitors  acting  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  requested  a
    variation of his status to enable him to study in the  United  Kingdom,
    but this application was refused on 13th October,  1989.   He  appealed
    that decision on 27th October, 1989 and the appeal was dismissed on 6th
    March, 1990.  He was subsequently removed to  Nigeria  on  20th  April,
    1991.

3.   On 6th March, 1990, at Guildhall Magistrates' Court, he  was  convicted
    of theft and obtaining property by deception and  was  fined  �75  with
    costs of �10.  On 28th November, 2001, he made  application  for  entry
    clearance to the British High Commission in Lagos which he withdrew the
    following day.  He then re-submitted the application on  5th  December,
    2001 and the application was refused on 18th March, 2002.

4.   On 19th October, 2005 the respondent applied for  entry  clearance  for
    the purpose of participating in  his  child's  care  proceedings  in  a
    United Kingdom court.  His application for entry clearance was  refused
    on 7th November 2005 and, although he lodged an appeal, he submitted  a
    further application on 7th April, 2006 which was refused on 11th April,
    2006.  His appeal against the  first  entry  refusal  was  subsequently
    allowed on 11th December, 2006.

5.   The respondent re-entered the  United  Kingdom  on  20th  April,  2007,
    again on a six month entry clearance as a visitor.  On 25th  September,
    2007 he made an application to extend  his  visit  visa  but  this  was
    rejected on 7th October, 2007 for failure to pay the relevant fee.   On
    15th July, 2010 the respondent then made an application  for  leave  to
    remain  outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  but  this  application   was
    rejected.  He applied on four further occasions  and  his  applications
    were refused on 25th October, 2010, 9th December, 2010, 28th June, 2011
    and 8th December, 2011 respectively.

6.   On 6th August, 2013,  the  claimant  claims  that  the  respondent  was
    served with  IS151A  as  an  overstayer.   On  28th  March,  2014,  the
    respondent applied for an EEA residence card as the spouse  of  an  EEA
    national family member, which was refused on 27th October, 2014.

7.   On 24th June, 2014,  at  Maidstone  Crown  Court,  the  respondent  was
    convicted of concealing, disguising, converting, transferring  and  the
    removal of criminal property.  On 27th June, 2014, at the  same  court,
    he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment  and  ordered  to  pay  a
    victim surcharge of �120.

8.   On 25th November, 2014, he was served with a Section  94B  decision  to
    deport and an accompanying letter and a deportation  order  dated  20th
    November, 2014.   He  lodged  an  appeal  against  deportation  on  3rd
    December, 2014.  This was refused on 15th December, 2015 as he was  out
    of time.  On 5th March, 2015  the  respondent  lodged  application  for
    judicial review.  On 5th May, 2015 a consent order was signed  agreeing
    to withdraw the claimant's previous decision and instead considered the
    respondent as a family member of  an  EEA  national.   The  deportation
    order was signed under the UK Borders Act 2007 and was revoked on  13th
    May, 2015.  On  11th  June,  2015,  the  claimant  decided  to  make  a
    deportation  order  and  the  respondent  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  His appeal was heard at Taylor House on 12th  October,  2015
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Stewart.

9.   It appears that, unfortunately, the judge did not have a  copy  of  the
    indictment considered by the Crown Court.   The  judge  appears  to  be
    unclear as to the exact particulars of the respondent's  conviction  on
    24th June, 2014.  It is important because the respondent maintains that
    he has progressed in his rehabilitation since having been convicted  of
    concealing, disguising, converting, transferring  and  the  removal  of
    criminal property, but in Judge Stewart's determination,  at  paragraph
    12, the judge  records  that  the  respondent  did  not  have  a  clear
    understanding of the seriousness of his  conviction.   As  far  as  the
    respondent was concerned and not withstanding his expressions of sorrow
    at transgressions which led to his convictions, he received  money  for
    the introduction of clients to a commercial organisation.   As  far  as
    the respondent was concerned, he was earning commission in exactly  the
    same way as lots of people earn commission, that is for  introductions.
    It appears, however, that what the  respondent  was  concerned  in  was
    money laundering.      The judge believed that the respondent should be
    allowed to continue his rehabilitative progress and concluded that  the
    deportation of the respondent was not proportionate.

10.  The claimant challenged the decision  and  before  me  today  Mr  Tufan
    suggested that there were effectively only two challenges.   The  first
    is that the judge had failed to take into account that  the  respondent
    had not completed a five year period of  residence  as  an  EEA  family
    member and, secondly, that it is clear from paragraph 12 of the judge's
    decision that the respondent does  not  appear  to  have  accepted  his
    culpability and, put simply, there can be no rehabilitation  without  a
    full acceptance  of  responsibility  for  the  offence  committed.   He
    suggested that the decision needed to be re-made afresh.

11.   Counsel  argued  that  the  judge  had  dealt  with  the  respondent's
    background at paragraph 3 and had  undertaken  an  examination  of  the
    extensive courses and steps which the respondent had embarked on whilst
    he was in prison in order to rehabilitate  himself.   She  pointed  out
    that this evidence had not been considered by the claimant.  The  judge
    looked at other EEA cases at paragraph 19, but the fact is  that  there
    is no case law dealing with a family member.  However,  from  paragraph
    27 of the determination, it is  clear  that  the  judge  did  carefully
    examine the  steps  the  respondent  had  embarked  upon  in  order  to
    rehabilitate himself and points out at paragraph 30  the  factors  that
    she had taken into account including his age, his health, the fact that
    his wife was an EEA national exercising treaty rights residing  in  the
    United Kingdom and would have to relocate to Nigeria to continue living
    with her husband were he to be deported there.  In doing so  she  would
    lose contact with her daughter and three children who would continue to
    live in London.  The fact is that the  respondent's  wife  has  medical
    conditions which require ongoing treatment and it is a fact that he has
    three children living in the United Kingdom, all of  whom  are  British
    citizens, although of course  all  are  adults.   She  also  took  into
    account his residence in the United Kingdom  since  2007,  albeit  that
    part of it was as an overstayer and part while he  was  in  prison  and
    that they do not count for the purpose of giving him  residence  for  a
    continuous period of  five  years.   The  judge  also  noted  that  the
    respondent's removal to Nigeria would provide him with no  prospect  of
    any  family  support  in  the  task  of  rehabilitation  and  there  is
    accommodation available for him in London with some measure of  support
    from his wife.

12.  I concluded that the judge did err in law materially in  his  decision.



13.  He failed to take into account that the respondent is somebody who  has
    completed less than five years' residence in the United Kingdom.   That
    was important and the absence of any recognition of the limited  period
    of his entitlement as an EEA family member is, I believe, crucial.

14.  I am also concerned at what the judge  said  at  paragraph  12  of  the
    determination, because it certainly gives the clear indication that the
    respondent seemed to have no clear understanding of the serious  nature
    of his convictions.  He appears to have been  involved  in  some  money
    laundering scheme but, as far as he was concerned, he was only  earning
    a commission in exactly the same way as other people earned commission,
    namely for introductions.  That is difficult to reconcile with what the
    judge said about the respondent's rehabilitation.  I  am  of  the  view
    that if the respondent fails, as it appears, to accept his  culpability
    there can be little true rehabilitation.

15.  I have concluded that the matter should be looked at again,  given  the
    clear errors of law.  I have decided that the  determination  of  Judge
    Stewart should be set aside and the matter be re-heard afresh  de  novo
    by the Upper Tribunal.

16.  I direct that the  respondent's  representatives  will  file  with  the
    Tribunal:

          1. a copy of the indictment considered  by  the  Maidstone  Crown
             Court on 24th June, 2014;

          2. a copy of any pre-sentence probation  reports  that  may  have
             been prepared in respect of the respondent.

    those documents (copies of which should be  easily  obtainable  by  the
    respondent from his former solicitors) to be served within  twenty  one
    days of this decision being promulgated.



Notice of Decision

The decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Stewart is  set  aside.   I  remit
the appeal to be heard afresh de novo by  the  First  Tier  Tribunal,  by  a
judge other that Judge Stewart.
