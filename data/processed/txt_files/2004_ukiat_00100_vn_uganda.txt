                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator  (Miss  DM  Lambert),
   sitting at Bradford on 7 July 2003, allowing an asylum and  human  rights
   appeal by a citizen of Uganda. Permission to  appeal  was  given  on  the
   basis that the adjudicator had failed to give proper consideration to the
   internal flight alternative. The vice-president who did so drew attention
   to the fact that the  Lord's  Resistance  Army  [LRA]  does  not  operate
   throughout Uganda. The importance of this was that the claimant had based
   her case on serious violence, fatal to her husband, caused by "rebels" in
   the central part of the country; and the LRA were the only rebel group of
   whose activities (very serious  in  the  north)  there  was  any  current
   background evidence before the adjudicator.

2. The claimant's case was that she  and  her  husband  lived  near  Masaka,
   about 75 miles south-west of Kampala. Since 1992  her  husband  had  been
   involved, as were others in his family, with a rebel group: he eventually
   admitted as much to her, but would not tell her what it  was  called.  In
   2002 she persuaded him to take up a government amnesty by handing in  his
   uniform (which apparently these rebels used), weapons and ammunition; but
   in October that year the rebels  raided  their  house  twice:  they  only
   escaped because they were sleeping in the outside kitchen.  The  security
   forces did not arrive till the next day, and they had to flee  to  Mpigi.
   As shown on the map helpfully put before us by Miss Plimmer,  this  is  a
   town between the capital,  Kampala,  and  the  international  airport  at
   Entebbe, no more than 20 miles from either; so about as central  a  place
   as there is in all Uganda.

3. However on 10 October 2002 the rebels raided their house in  Mpigi.  Both
   the claimant and her husband were dragged outside, and she  was  held  at
   gun-point and had to watch him hacked to pieces. She fainted,  and  later
   woke up in a clinic without her children, who it seemed  had  been  taken
   away by her husband's family. The claimant returned home; but after  some
   time she was threatened with death by her brother-in-law. It  seemed  his
   family blamed her for her husband's death, because she had encouraged him
   to take up the amnesty. She sold her land for enough ready money  to  pay
   for her flight here. Since she came to this country, she has  heard  that
   other friends in the village have been killed by rebels, who  were  still
   after her for the equipment her husband had handed in to the authorities.

4. The adjudicator was  persuaded  by  counsel  for  the  claimant,  in  the
   absence of any presenting officer on  the  other  side,  to  accept  this
   account of events, though she herself noted that there  was  no  evidence
   before her indicating that the LRA or other rebel groups operated at  all
   in  the  area  south-west  of  Kampala  where  the  claimant  lived.  The
   adjudicator was at least realistic enough to point out that her  decision
   might have been otherwise, if the Home Office had played  their  part  in
   the proceedings by fielding a presenting  officer  to  cross-examine  the
   claimant.

5. The adjudicator reached her conclusions (�  9.7)  on  the  basis  of  the
   background evidence she had referred  to  at  �  9.2.  This  referred  to
   inability on the part of the government "... to provide adequate security
   even for so-called protected villages and IDP camps  against  large-scale
   rebel attacks". These attacks were of course those  of  the  LRA  in  the
   north. That, together with the individual history she had accepted,  made
   it clear to her that "... there is no  operative  system  for  protection
   sufficient to deter the kinds of atrocity feared by  this  Appellant  and
   that she cannot effectively be protected anywhere in Uganda".

6.  Miss  Plimmer  provided  another  set  of  reasons  for  supporting  the
   adjudicator on the result she had reached on internal flight;  but  these
   too depended on the credibility of the claimant's individual account. She
   was well aware of the difficulties we faced in  basing  any  decision  of
   ours on an account which was completely unsupported by  anything  in  the
   background evidence; but she stoutly maintained  that  the  adjudicator's
   credibility decision, not having been challenged by the  Home  Office  in
   their grounds of appeal, or - at least directly - put  in  issue  by  the
   vice-president who gave leave, could not now  be  re-opened,  without  at
   least an adjournment to allow her to prepare for that.

7. If the Home Office had challenged the adjudicator's credibility  decision
   on the basis of the lack of background evidence of any rebel activity  in
   recent years anywhere within hundreds of miles of Masaka or  Mpigi,  then
   we should have had no hesitation in allowing their appeal.  The  lack  of
   background evidence to support an  individual  history  is  of  course  a
   question of degree: there may be countries where  armed  rebel  activity,
   even midway between the capital and the main international  airport,  may
   possibly go unrecorded in published or other independent evidence.  Given
   the volume of evidence of that kind which is available on Uganda, we have
   no doubt that it is not such a country.


8.  There  is  however  only  a  difference  in  degree  between  what  this
   adjudicator  decided,  and  acceptance  of  an  account  of  armed  rebel
   activity, unrecorded in the  press  or  official  sources,  at  -  say  -
   Twickenham, or some such spot between central London  and  Heathrow.  She
   seems not to have been unaware of the potential  variance  -  to  put  it
   politely - between what she had decided and the real world. However, from
   what she said about the possibility of a different  result  if  the  Home
   Office had been represented, she seems to have felt  herself  constrained
   by the one-sided nature of the adversarial procedure before her to decide
   the case in the way she did.

9. That was certainly a mistake - and, if it were necessary for us to  reach
   a view on this, one of law. Adjudicators have a public  duty  to  inquire
   into the facts before them, and not to accept an account  simply  because
   it has gone uncontradicted. This adjudicator's point (�  9.4)  about  the
   name of the rebel group not  being  "women's  business"  might  have  had
   something to say about the claimant's own ignorance of it; but nothing at
   all to show that the group  had  any  real  existence  which  had  passed
   unnoticed by the world at large.

10. Even if the Home Office fail to help adjudicators, as all too often,  by
   fielding a presenting officer before them, they too have  a  duty  to  do
   what they can to correct decisions which are askew  with  the  verifiable
   real world. We should not expect them to seek  permission  to  appeal  on
   mere "cross-examination points" which could have been pursued before  the
   adjudicator (and it would likely be refused, as not raising any  question
   of law); but failure to take account of the  background  evidence  -  or,
   just as important, the lack of any on the point in question, is certainly
   appealable, and should be  directly  challenged  where  material  to  the
   decision.

11. The problem with which we are faced is caused by  the  combined  failure
   of the adjudicator and the Home Office to take proper account of the lack
   of background evidence to  support  the  claimant's  account.  The  vice-
   president who gave leave could not be expected to do more than  note,  as
   he clearly did, the effect of that on the internal  flight  argument.  We
   find it hard to overturn the adjudicator's decision as a  whole,  without
   her credibility findings having been properly challenged on appeal.

12. On the other hand, the adjudicator's decision  on  internal  flight  was
   challenged, and it was plainly wrong on its own terms, since it  depended
   in large part on  the  background  evidence  of  lack  of  protection  by
   government forces for persons displaced by a set of rebels very much more
   formidable than these (if they existed), hundreds  of  miles  away  in  a
   quite different part of the country.  Miss  Plimmer  has  invited  us  to
   uphold it, for a different set of reasons,  but  one  which  in  the  end
   depends on our also accepting the credibility of the claimant's account.

13. That in our view is a different matter. If  the  adjudicator's  decision
   could otherwise have been upheld as a whole on its own  terms,  the  Home
   Office's failure to challenge her findings on credibility might have been
   led to their appeal being dismissed. However, asking us  to  adopt  those
   findings, in order to substitute a set of views on  the  availability  of
   government protection in central Uganda which  we  regard  as  wholly  at
   variance with the background evidence, is in our view a step too far.

14. Miss Plimmer's case on internal flight was  that,  even  if  the  rebels
   themselves would not hunt the claimant down, her husband's  family  would
   do so - and she could not  pass  unknown,  because  of  the  registration
   requirement which had led them to find her in Mpigi. The only evidence of
   lack of protection against either  rebels  or  in-laws  -  and  the  only
   evidence that the in-laws  were  remotely  interested  in  pursuing  this
   claimant outside their home area - is the attack in  Mpigi  itself.  Miss
   Plimmer's complaint was that she was not on notice that  the  credibility
   of that might be under challenge  for  lack  of  background  evidence  to
   support it, which she might have been able to produce.

15. We regard this as a somewhat technical point, not to say a  disingenuous
   one for a specialist practitioner of any experience to pursue, since  the
   question of the country-wide existence of rebels had been clearly  raised
   - if only in the internal flight context - in the  grant  of  permission.
   However, we propose to put Miss  Plimmer's  position  to  the  test.  The
   adjudicator's decision must in any case be quashed on the internal flight
   point. Miss Plimmer suggested that the case might be  "remitted"  to  the
   same adjudicator. We regard that suggestion  as  hopelessly  unrealistic:
   Miss Lambert would find  it  hard  to  extricate  herself  from  her  own
   credibility decision, similarly at variance with reality, so far  as  the
   background evidence before her was concerned.

16. What we propose is a fresh  hearing  before  another  adjudicator.  That
   adjudicator would be quite free to reconsider the claimant's  credibility
   for themselves. If acceptable published  or  other  independent  evidence
   were put before them to support any significant rebel activity in  either
   the Masaka or Mpigi areas from 2002 to date, then  they  could  disregard
   our strictures on Miss Lambert's credibility  decision,  which  would  be
   revealed as more prescient than she could possibly have expected. If not,
   then they might well wish to take our views into account.
