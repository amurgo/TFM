                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




 1. This is a matter where the 1st Appellant and his wife and  children  as
    dependants (whose appeals I have not considered  this  morning),  apply
    with leave against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge Archer
    who dismissed all appeals against the refusal by the Secretary of State
    to allow 1st Appellant leave to remain in the United Kingdom as an Tier
    1 entrepreneur.

 2. The issue before the judge was very narrow but I am  satisfied  it  was
    primarily a factual issue that required detailed consideration.  It was
    not a simple allocation of whether or not points were acquired  or  not
    because in your application the Respondent at page 2 accepted that  you
    largely  met  the  requirements  of  the  relevant  Immigration   Rule,
    paragraph 245DD,  but  no  points  were  awarded  because  it  was  not
    considered that your occupation met  National  Qualification  Framework
    Level 4 or above, the relevant notice in this context  means  that  the
    core service's business provides to its customers or  clients  involves
    the business delivering a service in an occupation at this  level.   It
    excludes any work involved in the administration, marketing or  website
    functions of the business.  In other words, ancillary to that.

 3. The refusal letter goes on to say:

         "Your stated job title of Marketing Consultant does not reflect the
         services that your business is offering.   The  evidence  you  have
         supplied for business activity shows that the core service of  your
         business is courier and freight."

 4. The judge dismissed that application.  The  determination  shows  as  a
    whole that there were a number of matters of quite large  substance  in
    that determination that appears to have absolutely no relevance to  the
    point in issue, namely effectively the whole of pages 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,  9
    and most of page 10.

 5. The essential point that is being argued, in respect of which leave was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy is it said that the judge  did
    not properly consider all the  evidence  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, although it is also correct  he  does  not  appear  to  have
    considered the nature  of  the  Appellant's  work  and  whether  it  is
    occupation skilled at AQ4 Level 4.  In other words, the judge  has  not
    properly considered the refusal granted to Appendix A Attributes.

 6. The matter effectively can be fairly summarised  if  one  looks  at  QA
    Speedy Freight Services Limited business  plan.   This  sets  out  that
    essentially, at page 19 of the bundle that was  before  the  First-tier
    Judge, that they are a specialist company involved in the importing and
    exporting of goods using, crucially, expertise and connections  in  the
    freight market to offer competitive rates to its clients.  It is not  a
    freight company that has its own distribution service.

 7. Now, the relevant issue is actually  looking  at  the  Appellant's  job
    tasks, which are set out at page 16.  It shows,  for  example,  a  tick
    Marketing Consultant, discussing business methods, quantitative  market
    research, collating, finding advertising teams.  That is his title.   I
    accept that within that, therefore, there is clearly a  distinction  to
    be made, firstly whether or not the freight service as a whole is  that
    of a specialist organisation and the marketing within that is therefore
    at a high level or simply, as the  Respondent  asserted,  that  it  was
    merely an ancillary aspect of the business.

 8. The criticism is that the  judge  failed  to  really  enter  into  that
    analysis.  There  is  no  analysis  of  the  situation.   There  is  no
    consideration of the  code  of  practice,  there  is  no  consideration
    whether or not therefore the Appellant's business was in law sufficient
    to meet the levels required or not.

 9. Although it is therefore a question of fact,  and  normally  the  Upper
    Tribunal would be reluctant to interfere  with  a  primary  finding  of
    fact, I am not satisfied that the judge was actually  concentrating  on
    the core issue that he had to determine.  It may well be  that  he  got
    confused.  It may well be that actually he  made  the  right  decision.
    But I am not satisfied on a bare reading of the determination  that  it
    is clear which way he was thinking.  I am concerned that he  was  still
    considering, at paragraph 22,  that  he  was  marketing  and  importing
    clothing from abroad.  That is not the situation.  It is marketing  the
    arrangements to bring clothing in from abroad:  subtly  but  materially
    different.

10. So on that primary ground of appeal, without considering the grounds of
    appeal relating to  the  dependants,  whose  applications  fall  to  be
    determined in line with this Appellant, I  am  satisfied  there  is  an
    error of law.

11. After submissions from  both  advocates  I  am  satisfied  this  is  an
    appropriate matter for further evidence and submissions on in the Upper
    Tribunal.

12. Having announced my decision on the 4th April I  then  made  directions
    for the matter to be listed for a final hearing.;



Proceedings on 21st May 2014

13. Mr Bramble helpfully lodged a copy of the archived code of practice for
    skilled  workers  6th  April  2013.   Mr  Bramble's  and  Mr   Jaisri's
    concentration was referenced to SOC20103543 (referred  to  subsequently
    as 3543) marketing associate  professionals.   The  relevance  of  this
    document is an introduction - this document is aimed at  employers  who
    are looking to sponsor a migrant through the points-based  system.   It
    mainly applies to Tier 2 (General) and Tier 2 (Intra-Company  Transfer)
    categories.  However it also applies to some parts of Tier 5  to  post-
    study workers switching to Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  and  to  work  permit
    holders applying for settlement.  It is also used by UK  Border  Agency
    caseworkers.  It is therefore relevant guidance for consideration.  The
    general use of the document  is  as  follows  -  you  should  use  this
    document to determine what skill level and minimum rates of pay are for
    any  job  you  may  want  to  recruit  for  and  obtain  the   relevant
    classification code when assigning a certificate of  sponsorship.   The
    marketing associate professional gives the following example job tasks:

       . Discusses  business  methods,  products  or  services  and  targets
         customer group  with  employer  or  client  in  order  to  identify
         marketing requirements.

       . Establishes an  appropriate  quantitative  and  qualitative  market
         research methodology and prepares proposals outlining programmes of
         work and details of costs.

       . Collates and interprets findings of market  research  and  presents
         results to clients.

       . Discusses possible changes that need to be made in terms of design,
         price, packaging promotion etc. in light of  market  research  with
         appropriate departments.

       . Briefs  advertising  team  on  client  requirements,  monitors  the
         progress of advertising campaigns and liaises client  on  potential
         modifications

    Related job titles:

       . Business development executive.

       . Fundraiser.

       . Market research analysis.

       . Marketing consultant.

       . Marketing executive.

    Salary rates: new entrants �17,400, experienced �21,000.

14. The corporate business plan for Q and A Speedy Freight Limited sets out
    an introduction that it is a  team  of  professionally  qualified  MBAs
    offering freight  services  to  companies  and  businesses  located  in
    southeast England.  Under business environment and goals as well as  by
    reference to where their  business  activity  and  reference  to  trade
    volumes say expertise in connections in the  freight  market  to  offer
    competitive rates to its clients Q  and  A  Speedy  business  model  is
    designed to develop alliances with  shipping  companies  for  obtaining
    wholesale rates, maximising corporate customer  base  and  to  offer  a
    unique, efficient and  cost-effective  service.   The  short  term  key
    objectives were to meet  deadlines  and  offer  best  services  to  our
    customers to explore all available resources whilst offering prices  to
    offer solutions to complex shipping consignments.   To  keep  ourselves
    updated  with  the  latest   developments,   legal   requirements   and
    Regulations for appropriate training and seminars.  The  contract  that
    was relied  upon,  one  was  from  Geno  Services  Limited  that  makes
    reference to Q and A Speedy Freight Services  as  a  market  consultant
    services to be provided during the length of this contract  the  market
    consultant shall serve the client and perform all services  related  to
    pricing, shipping schedules, preparing freight proposals if the  client
    may require in connection with his business  including  preparation  of
    shipping documents.

15. Mr Bramble's contention was that job description 3543 and  its  related
    job titles seemed to be the appropriate  box  that  the  Appellant  was
    seeking to establish he fell within.   I  was  asked  to  look  at  the
    business plan products to services and a brief letter and that was  the
    evidence that was lodged before the Secretary  of  State.   Mr  Bramble
    could also state that it was clear from his file that  the  description
    3543 was put before the case owner although there was no relevant  note
    as to what the case owner concerned had considered.  The general letter
    from Geno rather than a contract was lodged at appeal stage and was not
    available at the date of decision, it  was  postdecision.   Mr  Bramble
    accepted that it was not an easy matter to resolve, he  confirmed  that
    on his understanding of the refusal letter which was  congruent  to  Mr
    Jaisri's and myself that this was the only matter that the  case  owner
    was concerned about.  If I was satisfied as to the job qualification it
    would  therefore  be  appropriate  for  me   to   allow   the   appeal,
    alternatively I could refer the matter back to the Secretary of  State.



16. Mr Jaisri's argument was that read as a whole the evidence  before  the
    Secretary of State was clear that  this  was  a  business  to  business
    enterprise.  It was clear that within the context of a large  developed
    economy that the various methods of  bringing  goods  into  the  United
    Kingdom were both diverse and the rates of which a person may  have  to
    pay a freight company could clearly vary.  He  asked  me  to  draw  the
    common sense analogy between requiring airfreight for perishable goods,
    shipping for non-perishable low fashion items as against the demand  to
    bring possibly non-perishable but items that may have a limited  period
    when they would be attractive to  market  into  the  UK.   Within  that
    context and looking at the Appellant's business essentially he would be
    carrying out the methods analysis set in 3543.   The company would need
    to look at the request from their client, what type of  goods,  make  a
    evaluation of what was  available  within  the  market  place,  make  a
    recommendation to discuss price and it would be ancillary to that  that
    the shipping documents would be supplied.  Mr Jaisri emphasised that he
    regarded that is important because the  shipping  documents  he  fairly
    accepted would not fall within Tier 4 but that was the ancillary matter
    of the company not its prime business activity.  I reserved my decision
    which I now give with my reasons.

17. On occasions application for a leave to remain as an  entrepreneur  are
    moderately straightforward  as  I  observed  in  court  a  car  washing
    business  would not reach Tier 4 level.  On occasions however  business
    proposals are not clear as to which if any relevant code they  attract.
    I am satisfied that this indeed is such a business case.  I  do  accept
    broadly the points submitted by Mr Jaisri  such  that  I  am  satisfied
    overall that the Respondent did not fairly take into account that  this
    business of Q and A Speedy Freight Services Limited  is  essentially  a
    business to business model.  As Mr Bramble fairly accepted the  company
    is  not  simply  a  courier  of  freight.     Overall   after   careful
    consideration of the documents I am satisfied that the business broadly
    falls within "3543;" it is discussing business methods and  methods  of
    delivering within a  complex  economic  environment.   There  would  be
    inevitably ancillary paperwork but that is ancillary, the core  of  the
    business however I am satisfied is  that  of  a  skilled  company  well
    within the criteria generally of NVQF Level 4.   It  therefore  follows
    that the Appellant has 25 points issued to him under attributes.

18. There being no other matter essentially  under  dispute,  it  therefore
    follows that the  other  points  would  be  awarded  as  claimed.   The
    immigration appeal therefore succeeds.   I  have  carefully  considered
    whether it is appropriate to make a costs order in this matter  as  the
    appeal has succeeded however overall having regard to the  complexities
    of this matter I am satisfied a fee award is  not  appropriate.   There
    was no application for an  anonymity  order  and  none  appears  to  be
    appropriate.
