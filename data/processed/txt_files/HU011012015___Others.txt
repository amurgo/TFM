                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellants, nationals of Somalia, dates of  birth  respectively  10
    January 1948, 3 March 2000 and 7 June 2002, sought to join, so  far  as
    the second and third Appellants are concerned, their father in the  UK.
    The first  Appellant  is  the  grandmother  of  the  second  and  third
    Appellants and the mother of the Sponsor in the  UK.  The  ECO  refused
    their applications on 3 June 2015.
2.     At their appeals before First-tier Tribunal Judge PJ Robinson  (  the
    Judge) the Sponsor, Mr Mahamed Mahamud Mahamed, provided evidence and a
    witness statement which was before the Judge and a supporting statement
    from  a  Mr  Abukar  Hussein  Mahamood,  particularly  addressing   his
    willingness to be a second Sponsor.  The Judge dismissed the appeal  of
    the first appellant, as a dependant relative and both child  Appellants
    with reference to paragraph 352D(iv) of the Immigration  Rules  HC  395
    (as amended) but also for all the Appellants with reference to  Article
    8 ECHR grounds.  The judge's decision on 23 February  2017  led  to  an
    application to appeal which was granted on 14 September 2017 by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Landes.  The Respondent made a Rule 24 response  on
    30 October 2017.

3.   It is of note that the Appellants did not through the process of  their
    appeals  against  the  ECO's  decision  seemingly  file  any   evidence
    whatsoever as to their personal circumstances, their relationship  with
    the Sponsor, their relationship with the first Appellant and  the  role
    they played in her life.  Plainly, that was a limitation on the Judge's
    ability to assess the implications in Article 8 terms of the effects of
    separation, the effects of possibly the  second  and  third  Appellants
    leaving their grandmother behind in Somalia and also the impact on  her
    of them removing to the UK, leaving her on her own.  Why that  evidence
    was not adduced is not clear but it is no criticism of Mr Chelliah  for
    he did not appear before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  to  argue  the
    case.
4.     Ultimately Mr Chelliah now argues that in effect the Judge failed  to
    address as a matter of approach the best interests of  the  second  and
    third Appellants or properly the  relationship  which  they  have  with
    their grandmother and the impact of their removal  upon  her  and  vice
    versa.  The significance of those points is that, on the way  the  case
    was presented, they were not  the  principal  issues.  Looking  at  the
    bundle provided to the Judge and noting the arguments that were  raised
    the case had not proceeded on  that  basis.   Rather,  the  Appellants'
    Sponsor was essentially saying he had the money to  support,  a  second
    Sponsor would also help if need be, the  Sponsor  was  related  to  his
    mother and the second and third Appellants were his children.

5.   It is trite law that decisions should be read as a whole having  regard
    not least to the way in which the case was advanced.   I  do  not  find
    from reading the decision and from the material advanced in support  of
    the appeal that the case concentrated on  the  best  interests  of  the
    children so much as a plain argument that they should  be  entitled  to
    join their father in the UK.
6.    On a fair reading of the  grounds  of  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge the case was simply not advanced by reference  to  their
    best interests.  Even, as Mr Chelliah rightly says, the fact that  they
    are  out  of  the  UK  does  not  ignore  their  best  interests  as  a
    consideration that may need to be addressed.  However, the Judge had  a
    complete dearth of information about the impact upon the  relationships
    between the second and third Appellants and  the  first  Appellant  and
    indeed any relationship or contact they actually have in  a  meaningful
    way with the Sponsor.  Thus it is perhaps hard to criticise  the  Judge
    for failing to embark upon an exercise  of  considering  best  interest
    when it was not apparently a matter being raised.
7.    No evidence was  being  provided  from  the  UK  or  indeed  from  the
    Appellants as to those matters and  I  conclude  that  that  is  not  a
    sustainable criticism in the light of the way the case  was  presented.
    Even though, whilst in principle a Judge should have in mind  the  best
    interests in respect of out of country Appellants who are children, the
    fact that the Judge did not do so on the evidence before him  does  not
    suggest any other Tribunal properly addressing the evidence  before  it
    could  have  reached  a  different  decision.   Mr   Chelliah   further
    criticised that the Judge's reasoning because he did  not  sufficiently
    explain his view as to the considerations that bear on the  second  and
    third Appellants.
8.      Mr Walker argued that in the light of the way the Judge  dealt  with
    it, at paragraphs 30 to 32 of the decision, was sufficient to show that
    the Judge must have had in mind the interests of the  children  in  the
    Article 8 context and the fact was that on the Sponsor's  own  case  he
    had ceased to have direct contact with his family at some time in 2002,
    bearing in mind the second Appellant was born in  March  2000  and  the
    third Appellant in June 2002.  As the Judge noted and concluded:

         "In cross-examination, he confirmed that his mother had been caring
         for his children since 2011.  He said he had last  lived  with  his
         children in 2002 and he last with his mother in 1998.  He confirmed
         that his [I think that should be he] was legally divorced from  the
         children's mother.  He said he could go to live in Kenya because of
         his work in the UK and the fact that he supports the children  from
         his income.  He sent them between �200 and �300 per month."

    There is therefore no real evidence to help a Judge as to the nature of
    the present  relationship  and  the  effects  of  continued  separation
    between the second and third Appellants with their Sponsor father.


    9.     In the circumstances, whilst it is brief, it seems to me that on
          the evidence the Judge had there was little more to be said  other
          than to comment on the absence of evidence.  I concluded therefore
          that the reasoning was adequate and sufficient to properly address
          the case as presented.  How this case might have proceeded on  any
          other basis with greater evidence I do not speculate but  it  does
          not seem to me fair to criticise the Judge on the limited material
          that was actually before him.

10.  Accordingly I conclude that the original Tribunal's decision  discloses
    no material error of law.  The original Tribunal's decision stands.
