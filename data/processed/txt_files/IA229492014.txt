For the Appellant:     Mr G Nyadi (LR)
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ian Howard, promulgated on 2nd April 2015, following a hearing  a
    Hatton Cross on 10th February 2015.  In the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal of Samuel  Onyenyerechi  Nwaotite,  whereupon  the
    Appellant, subsequently applied to,  and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Nigeria, who was born on 7th July
    1988.  He appeals against the decision of the Respondent dated 8th  May
    2014, refusing his application for variation  of  leave,  as  a  person
    entitled to leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General)
    Student Migrant under paragraph 245ZX of the Immigration Rules.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that in reaching his  conclusions,  the  judge
    had mixed up the facts.  The correct version of the facts were that the
    Appellant's leave to remain was to expire on 6th April 2014.   He  made
    an online application to renew which was received by the Home Office on
    4th April 2014.  However, the Appellant does concede that he failed  to
    enclose the bank statement from his Sponsor on that date as it had  not
    arrived from Nigeria.  The bank statement however arrived on 5th April,
    the following day, and the Appellant promptly sent his  application  on
    the same day.  He forwarded the bank statement to the  Home  Office  by
    recorded delivery number SC992328324GD.

 4. This application was posted before the Appellant's leave  expired.   In
    fact it was confirmed that the documents  were  received  by  the  Home
    Office on 7th April 2014.  What the judge states, on the other hand, is
    that, "He told me that the bank statement in fact arrived  on  15th  or
    16th April 2014 and was sent by him to the Respondent as soon as he had
    it ..." (paragraph 9).

 5. Second, the Appellant also contended that the judge  erred  in  law  at
    paragraph 16 in failing to address the issue of Article 8  rights,  and
    this was irrespective of whether it was phrased before the Tribunal  or
    not.  Attention was drawn to the case of Mukarka [2006] EWCA Civ  1045.
    The judge did not give proper regard to the fact that the Appellant was
    in his final years of study in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  fee  paying
    student and the proportionality of the Respondent's decision had to  be
    valued during the context of this fact.

The Judge's Findings

 6. The judge recorded  the  evidence  that  the  Appellant  had  told  the
    Tribunal that, "He did not enclose his Sponsor's  bank  statement  with
    his application as it had not arrived from Nigeria in time and  he  did
    not want to be adjudged an overstayer by not submitting the application
    to vary leave ..." (paragraph 9).  The judge went on to hold  that  the
    application was a points-based scheme  application  and  therefore  the
    provisions of Section 85A of the 2002 Act  applied.   These  provisions
    "Preclude me from considering material that was not  submitted  at  the
    time of the application unless 'by the  qualifications  to  the  second
    exception as set out in Section 84A' ..." (paragraph  11).   The  judge
    went on to hold that the Appellant could not  successfully  argue  that
    the decision was not in accordance with the law "Because of  a  failure
    on the part of the Respondent to follow her own Rules" (paragraph 12).

The Hearing Before RSIJ Martin

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on 28th May 2015 on the basis that the
    Article 8 issue should have been considered by the judge and a  failure
    to do so was an arguable error of law.  A Rule 24  response  dated  4th
    June 2015 was to the effect that irrespective of whether Article 8  was
    raised it was clear that the appeal had no prospect of succeeding under
    Article 8 given that the Supreme Court had held in Patel  that  however
    desirable it may be, there is no Article  8  right  to  complete  one's
    studies in the UK.

 8. Nevertheless, when the matter arose before RSIJ Martin on 21st  October
    2015 the only issue was whether a missing wage slip could be  produced,
    as this was the issue that went  to  the  consideration  of  Article  8
    rights.  The "Record of Proceedings" by RSIJ Martin reads as follows:

         "It seems (agreed by Walker)  that  the  Appellant  meets  all  the
         requirements of Appendix FM except for specified evidence  as  only
         five months' payslips produced (only  five  since  commencement  of
         employment).  If six, could have found, met Appendix FM.  Mr Walker
         will deal with it."

The Hearing

 9. At the hearing before me on 7th January 2016, Mr  Walker,  appeared  on
    behalf of the Respondent.  He very candidly submitted that at the  last
    hearing the only question was whether a missing sixth  wage  slip  from
    the Appellant's wife, who worked as a pharmacist  in  Tunbridge  Wells,
    could have been produced for October 2015, as she had already  produced
    five since she began her employment, and she had to produce evidence of
    six months' wage slips.  Mr Walker explained that he  received  a  wage
    slip in November 2015 for the period of  October  2015.   He  explained
    that, "I forwarded that wage slip to the case owner so that leave could
    be granted because the parties were married.  I now  concede  that  the
    Appellant succeeds under Appendix FM".

10. Mr Walker initially submitted that the best he could do was to ask  the
    caseworker again to get on with making the decision so as to allow  the
    application on the basis of Appendix FM given that, his  having  looked
    at the wage slip, it was clear to him that the requirements of Appendix
    FM had been met, as indeed had been the position  before  RSIJ  Martin.
    Mr Nyadi, expressed gratitude at this and indicated that  he  would  be
    happy to liaise with Mr Walker so as to  expedite  the  making  of  the
    decision, in order to prevent the matter returning before this Tribunal
    again.

11. However, upon reflection, Mr Walker conceded, that since he had already
    agreed that  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  had  been  met,  upon
    production of this outstanding wage slip, the proper course  of  action
    would be for me to allow the appeal.





Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the  determination  and  remake  the
    decision (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  The reason is quite  simply
    that the judge failed to give any attention to the Appellant's  Article
    8 rights and Appendix FM was not considered.  That is an error  in  the
    circumstances of this case.  Permission to appeal was  rightly  granted
    on this basis and I conclude that the error is such that  the  decision
    should be set aside.

Remaking the Decision

13. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today, and the ruling made by RSIJ Martin on 21st October 2015.  I note
    that the wage slip for the wife of  the  Appellant  was  sent  on  16th
    November 2015 by the NHS to Tunbridge Wells Hospital and this shows her
    net pay of ï¿½1,252.69.  I note that there is no issue  taken  about  the
    reliability of this sixth outstanding wage slip.

14. On the contrary, I note that Mr Walker,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent had before me today expressly stated that,  "I  concede  the
    Appellant now succeeds under Appendix FM", and had in fact so  directed
    the caseworker to decide the matter after his  appearance  before  RSIJ
    Martin on 21st October 2015, when she had entered the  note  that,  "Mr
    Walker will deal with it".

15. In the circumstances, since the requirements of Appendix FM are met,  I
    allow this appeal.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is  allowed
under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction is made.
