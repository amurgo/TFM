Representation

                    Co, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the entry clearance officer" and  to
    the respondent as "the claimant."

 2. The entry clearance officer appeals against the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge promulgated  on  12  November  2014,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.

 3. The claimant appealed the respondent's decision  dated  11  March  2013
    refusing her application for an entry clearance as a spouse. She is  an
    Afghan national, born on 16 August 1981. Her application  to  join  her
    sponsor in the UK was refused as she had  not  provided  the  sponsor's
    original wage slips, a letter  from  the  sponsor's  employer  and  the
    sponsor's bank statement to show corresponding payments of  salary,  as
    required by Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.

 4. The Judge noted at [16]  that  at  the  date  of  the  entry  clearance
    officer's  decision,  the  appellant  was  required  under  section  E-
    ECP3.1(a) of Appendix FM to produce specified documents  in  accordance
    with Appendix FM-SE showing that the sponsor had an annual gross income
    of �18,600  or  that  he  had  sufficient  savings  to  make  good  any
    shortfall. That she failed to do with the result that  the  application
    failed.

 5. The Judge referred to  the  evidence  produced  relating  to  earnings,
    including his P60 from Katsouris.  Those  earnings  for  the  tax  year
    amounted to �17,087.39 and were not sufficient to meet the requirements
    under Appendix FM [19]. He found that in his attempt to make  good  the
    shortfall the sponsor could not establish earnings from Cooper Thai  by
    reference to  payslips  and  his  bank  statements  as  required  under
    Appendix FM-SE. The appendix did  not  contain  any  provision  whereby
    earnings that are paid in cash can be established in  some  other  way.
    Accordingly, the appeal failed under the immigration rules [20].

 6. The Judge noted that there are sound policy reasons for requiring  that
    proper documentary evidence is to be produced as evidence  of  earnings
    because of the ease with which false documents including  P60s  can  be
    obtained  by  the  unscrupulous.  However,   this   consideration   was
    compensated for by the fact that HMRC wrote to the  sponsor  confirming
    that its records showed that he was paid �17,087 by  Katsouris  in  the
    tax year ending 5 April 2013 and �4,498 by  Cooper  Thai  in  this  tax
    year, and that he had been employed by Cooper  Thai  since  July  2010.
    That evidence was at least as compelling as that provided by  payslips,
    bank statements and employment letters. HMRC's letter also showed  that
    tax has been paid on all the sponsor's earnings in the tax year [23].

 7. The Judge noted at [24] that Parliament has provided in s.86(6) of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that the Tribunal  has  no
    jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart from the immigration  rules.
    Article 8 is not a means of circumventing this and does not  provide  a
    mechanism for dealing with near misses: Patel v SSHD [2014] IMM AR 456.
    He referred to the section in Lord Carnwath's judgement in  Patel  that
    deals with near misses, where it is  emphasised  that  the  Immigration
    Rules are the starting point for the consideration of  Article  8.  The
    balance drawn by  the  Immigration  Rules  might  be  relevant  to  the
    consideration of proportionality.  Lord  Carnwath  referred  to  Huang,
    where favourable treatment outside the Rules did not turn on how  close
    she came to compliance with paragraph 317 but on the application of the
    family values which underlay this paragraph and which were also at  the
    heart of Article 8.

 8. The Judge found that there was no dispute about the existence of family
    life between the claimant and her sponsor. The only dispute was whether
    they are able to maintain themselves. That went to the  proportionality
    of exclusion because of the public interest in ensuring that immigrants
    do not become a charge on public funds [25].

 9. The Judge found that in  circumstances  where  it  had  been  shown  by
    evidence  from  an  independent  and   impeccable   source   that   the
    requirements of this public interest are met, albeit not in the  manner
    mandated by Appendix FM-SE, there were sufficiently compelling  reasons
    for granting leave under Article 8 because it would be disproportionate
    to refuse admission simply because the requirements  of  this  appendix
    were not met. He concluded that nothing in the decision in Patel [2014]
    Imm AR 456 prevented him from reaching such a conclusion [25].

10. On 1 September 2015, the Upper Tribunal  granted  the  entry  clearance
    officer permission to appeal. In  granting  permission,  reference  was
    made to the production of documents by the sponsor at the  hearing  but
    that he had failed to provide bank statements covering the same  period
    which appeared to have been received after  the  hearing.  It  was  not
    clear if this was in accordance with the direction to  this  effect  or
    that the documents were served upon the entry clearance officer who had
    the opportunity to respond. As a general rule,  post  hearing  evidence
    should not be considered. Having assessed the  evidence  it  was  found
    that the claimant  had  not  shown  that  she  was  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the rules which is an arguably sustainable decision.

11. The Judge granting permission then considered the matter  by  reference
    to Article 8 and noted that the  First-tier  Tribunal  correctly  noted
    that the change in the sponsor's circumstances occurred after the  date
    of decision and was therefore inadmissible.  The  Judge  then  arguably
    erred after reminding himself that Article 8 is not to  be  used  as  a
    means to circumvent the rules by arguably doing precisely that at  [25]
    of the determination.

12. Mr Kotas submitted that the  Judge  erred  in  law,  having  failed  to
    provide adequate reasoning as to why maintenance of the  refusal  would
    lead to  an  unjustifiably  harsh  outcome.  In  this  case  the  entry
    clearance officer applied Appendix FM which is the route to be followed
    for those seeking leave to enter or remain on the basis of their family
    life with a British or settled person. Accordingly,  it  is  considered
    that the circumstances of this case  are  sufficiently  recognised  and
    catered for. Reference was  made  to  decisions  such  as  Nagre  which
    endorsed  the  secretary  of  state's  guidance  on  the   meaning   of
    exceptional circumstances, namely those where refusal would lead to  an
    unjustifiably harsh outcome.

13. The claimant and her  sponsor  could  continue  their  family  life  in
    Afghanistan if they chose to do so. There was no proper reasoning as to
    why it would be unjustifiably  harsh  for  the  sponsor  to  return  to
    Afghanistan. Both had family there who could provide assistance  and  a
    support network. Article 8 should not be used to circumvent immigration
    rules.

14. Nor was there any analysis by the Judge as to why  the  claimant  could
    not submit a further application; there was no reasoning as to  why  it
    would be unjustifiably harsh to require her to do so. Mr Kotas referred
    to the confirmation by Mr Reynolds at  the  hearing  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal that the relevant minimum  threshold  requirements  under  the
    immigration rules and Appendix FM-SE with regard to specified documents
    could now be properly met. Any  disruption  to  family  life  would  be
    proportionate under the circumstances.

15. He submitted that it therefore cannot be considered to be unjustifiably
    harsh to require the claimant to submit a further application  once  it
    can be demonstrated that the eligibility and financial requirements can
    be met with the required specified evidence.

16. Mr Kotas further relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in  SSHD
    v SS (Congo) and others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and referred in  particular
    to [40] where Lord Justice Richards stated  that  having  reviewed  the
    authorities, the Court considered that the state has a wider margin  of
    appreciation in determining the conditions to be satisfied before leave
    to enter is granted, by contrast  with  the  position  in  relation  to
    decisions regarding leave to remain for persons with a (non precarious)
    family life already established in the UK.

17. The secretary of state has made  some  use  of  this  wider  margin  of
    appreciation by excluding EX.1 as a basis for the  grant  of  leave  to
    enter, although it is available as a basis for the grant  of  leave  to
    remain. The leave to enter Rules therefore maintain, in general  terms,
    a reasonable relationship with the requirements of  Article  8  in  the
    ordinary run of cases.

18. Lord Justice Richards also held that it  remains  possible  to  imagine
    cases where the individual interests at stake  are  of  a  particularly
    pressing nature so that  a  good  claim  for  leave  to  enter  can  be
    established outside the rules. In the  view  of  their  Lordships,  the
    appropriate general formulation for this category is  that  such  cases
    will arise where  an  applicant  for  leave  to  enter  can  show  that
    compelling circumstances exist which are  not  sufficiently  recognised
    under the new rules to require the grant of such leave [40].

19. Lord Justice Richards held that the approach to Article 8 in the  light
    of the Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as in respect of  the
    substantive leave to enter and leave to remain rules in Appendix FM. In
    other  words,  the  same  general  position  applies,  that  compelling
    circumstances will have to apply to justify a grant of leave  to  enter
    or leave to remain where the evidence rules are not complied with. That
    is for two principal reasons set out at [52]  and  [53].  The  evidence
    rules have the same general objective as the substantive rules,  namely
    to limit the risk that someone is admitted into the UK and then becomes
    a burden on public resources.  Further,  enforcement  of  the  evidence
    rules ensures that everyone applying for leave to  enter  or  leave  to
    remain is treated equally and fairly  in  relation  to  the  evidential
    requirements they must satisfy.

20. It was thus held that  good  reason  would  need  to  be  shown  why  a
    particular applicant was entitled to more preferential  treatment  with
    respect to evidence than other applicants would expect to receive under
    the Rules. Moreover,  in  relation  to  the  proper  administration  of
    immigration controls, weight should also be given to the  secretary  of
    state's assessment of the  evidential  requirements  needed  to  ensure
    prompt and fair application of the substantive rules. If  an  applicant
    says that they should be given more preferential treatment with respect
    to  evidence  than  the  Rules  allow  for,  and  more   individualised
    consideration of their  case,  good  reason  should  therefore  be  put
    forward to justify that - [53].

21. Mr Kotas submitted that the finding by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at
    [25] was "absurd". There cannot  be  compelling  reasons  for  granting
    leave under Article 8 simply because the requirements of  the  Appendix
    were not met. This was a case where she could  not  meet  the  relevant
    evidential requirements, and not for any compelling reasons such as the
    sponsor's ill health or where children are involved,  but  simply  that
    the Appendix does not contain provisions whereby earnings that are paid
    in cash can be established in some other way.

22. Mr Kotas finally referred to [57] in SS (Congo), supra, where the Court
    held that the secretary of state is not required to take a  speculative
    risk as to whether the requirements  in  the  rules  will  in  fact  be
    satisfied in the future when deciding what to do. Generally, it is fair
    that the applicant should wait until circumstances have changed and the
    requirements in the Rules are satisfied  and  then  apply  rather  than
    attempting to jump the  queue  by  asking  for  preferential  treatment
    outside the rules in advance.

23. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Reynolds submitted that as at the date of
    hearing, the sponsor had shown by reference to the P60s  produced  that
    he earned above the relevant minimum  threshold.  The  hearing  of  the
    appeal was on 5 September 2014. The Judge allowed the claimant 21  days
    after hearing submissions in which to file the sponsor's  missing  bank
    statement and other documents relied on. That time was again  extended.
    The claimant's solicitors  eventually  filed  further  evidence  on  19
    September 2014 and 16 October 2014 [15]. It was on that basis that  the
    income threshold had been met.

24. With regard  to  compelling  circumstances,  he  submitted  that  since
    marrying the sponsor the claimant has been separated for a  substantial
    period of time. The sponsor went to Afghanistan in  2012.  Mr  Reynolds
    accepted during his submissions that there was no evidence why he could
    not have met up with the appellant in  Pakistan  over  the  intervening
    period. The application was in fact processed there.

25. He submitted that it is "implicit" from the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  that  compelling  circumstances  exist  as  this  is  a
    marriage that was contracted in 2010 and  they  are  still  not  living
    together. Although this perhaps  should  have  been  "properly  spelled
    out", such circumstances did exist.

26. Mr Reynolds accepted that the Rules would have to have  been  satisfied
    as at the date of decision. The application was made in October 2012.

27. In reply, Mr Kotas submitted that it  was  irrelevant  that  the  Rules
    could have been satisfied as at the date of the hearing.

    Assessment

28. It is not disputed that the claimant's appeal against the  decision  of
    the entry clearance officer to allow her entry clearance  to  join  her
    sponsor, failed under the Immigration Rules. The Judge found  that  the
    sponsor could not establish earnings from Cooper Thai by  reference  to
    payslips and his bank statements as required  by  Appendix  FM-SE.  The
    appendix does not contain provisions allowing for earnings paid in cash
    to be established in some other way.

29. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  directed  himself  in  accordance  with
    authority, including Patel  at  [24].  He  concluded  that  there  were
    sufficiently compelling reasons for granting leave under Article 8 such
    that it would be disproportionate to refuse  admission  simply  because
    the requirements of the Appendix were not met.

30. However, the Judge had also earlier correctly noted that the change  in
    the sponsor's circumstances took place after the date of  the  decision
    and was therefore not admissible. Having directed himself that  Article
    8 was not to be used as a means to circumvent  the  rules,  it  appears
    that the  Judge  in  fact  did  that  in  concluding  that  there  were
    sufficiently compelling reasons for granting leave under Article 8.

31. There were however  no  good  reasons  provided  to  justify  that  the
    appellant be given more preferential treatment with respect to evidence
    than  the  Rules  allow  for.   Nor  were  any  good  reasons  advanced
    justifying a more individualised consideration of  her  case  entitling
    her 'to jump the queue' by asking for  preferential  treatment  outside
    the Rules.

32. Nor did the Judge find that it would not be proportionate to expect the
    claimant to make a  further  application.  Her  application  failed  to
    comply with the relevant requirements under Appendix FM  and  FM-SE  of
    the Rules and no compelling circumstances consistent with the  approach
    referred to in Patel were identified as to why the Rules should not  be
    applied in her case in the usual way.

33. The contention by Mr Reynolds that it was implicit  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision that their separation for a number  of  years
    amounted to sufficiently compelling reasons for  granting  leave  under
    Article 8, fails to recognise the value to be attached having  a  clear
    statement of the standards applicable to everyone  and  fails  to  give
    proper weight to the judgement of the secretary of state  as  expressed
    in the Rules, regarding what is needed  to  meet  the  public  interest
    which is in issue - SS (Congo) at [55].  That is particularly so having
    regard to the concession made that the claimant  was  at  the  date  of
    hearing capable of meeting the Rules.

34. At the time of the  refusal  of  leave  to  enter  the  minimum  income
    requirements under the  Rules  in  respect  of  the  sponsor  were  not
    satisfied. Nor were there  any  compelling  circumstances  shown  which
    required grant of leave outside the rules. In such a case, the  sponsor
    could have waited to submit a properly supported application for  leave
    to  enter  when  the  requirements  of  the  rules  could  be  properly
    satisfied.

35. I accordingly find that the Judge erred in law in  finding  that  there
    were compelling circumstances to justify acceptance  of  the  sponsor's
    income which did not satisfy the requirements in Appendix FM-SE.

36. I accordingly set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and re-
    make it.

37.  I  have  referred  to  the  contentions  as  to  whether  there   were
    sufficiently compelling reasons for granting leave to enter on  Article
    8 grounds. However, for the reasons already given, I conclude  that  no
    such   circumstances   have   been   advanced.   There    is    nothing
    disproportionate in the entry clearance officer's  application  of  the
    Rules according to their terms in her case.

38. The fact that she may be able to say that this is a  case  of  a  "near
    miss" situation in relation  to  satisfying  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules, does not amount to compelling circumstances requiring the  grant
    of leave to enter outside the rules. In particular, in giving effect to
    the need to meet the public interest which is in issue, the requirement
    that the claimant make an entry clearance application from abroad  does
    not constitute  a  disproportionate  interference  with  her  right  to
    respect for family life.




    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law. Having set aside the decision aside I remake it and  substitute
    a decision dismissing the claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules
    and on Article 8 grounds.

    No anonymity direction is made.
