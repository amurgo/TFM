               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms M Chaggar, instructed by Fountain Solicitors
(Walsall)
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant appeals with permission against a decision of First-tier
Tribunal Judge Watson promulgated on 18 March 2020 dismissing his appeal
against a decision by the Secretary of State to refuse his asylum claim and
to refuse his human rights claim.  Although the appellant's age was
formerly in dispute it is now accepted that he was born on 16 May 2001.

Broadly, the appellant's case is that he is an Iranian Kurd, which is not
in dispute, that he and some of his friends were involved in supporting the
Partiya Jiyana Azad a Kurdistanï¿½ ("PJAK") by delivering leaflets and one
night when they were out a policeman was killed in the area where they were
delivering leaflets.  Although the appellant had nothing to do with this
incident his home was raided and he was suspected of involvement.  His
friend with whom he had been delivering leaflets was arrested and was found
to be in possession of a firearm.  The appellant was able, he says, to
avoid arrest as although police raided the family home he in fact was
staying with his sister and his father contacted him, arranged for an agent
to facilitate his departure and flight from Iran overland and he left later
that day.

The Secretary of State did not accept the appellant's account, did not
accept what had happened to him, did not accept there had been a raid nor
was she satisfied that he had been delivering leaflets for PJAK.

The judge heard evidence from the appellant and found that the appellant's
core account was consistent in the main albeit he was so lacking in detail
that it was difficult not to attain consistency.  She noted his account
that he had been delivering leaflets at midnight to 2am, that he then
returned to his sister's house and that at 9am in the morning his father
came to the sister's house and told them that their own home had been
raided and a policeman had been killed earlier in the day and he had been
suspected of involvement and a friend of his had been arrested.  The father
did not know why he was suspected but speculates that his name may have
been given by the friend who was arrested.

The judge expressly said that she thought there was no damage to the
appellant's credibility by not having claimed in a safe third country but
in essence found the core account of the raid to be implausible.

The judge found that it was clear from the external evidence that action
against family members of those suspected of involvement in anti-government
politics is severe and added to this the murder of a policeman the account
that the appellant gives is not credible, it not being plausible that the
police seeking the murderer of one of their colleagues had sufficient
knowledge to raid the family home very swiftly after the claimed killing
but then did not seek the suspect at his known sister's home which is
nearby, that it was not plausible that there would be no attempt to search
cars in the area and that the appellant could leave so straightforwardly.

Further, she did not find it plausible that the appellant's father, who is
said not to know anything about his claimed activities, would be able to
raise what must be a large sum of cash to pay for the agents within a few
hours of the house being raided and arrange for the appellant's flight.
She stated:

         "This account is not consistent with the background evidence before
         me and whilst acknowledging the consistency of the account given by
         the appellant this cannot make the incredible credible"

    but the judge also directed herself as to the dangers as to importing
    her own social and cultural background into the assessment of
    credibility and that she had not discounted the possibility of the
    appellant's account delivering leaflets with little knowledge of the
    group to be plausible.

The judge did find one minor inconsistency which she found would not have
been determinative.  The judge then went on to dismiss the appeal, stating:


         "I have accepted explanations given for a major inconsistency and
         have not found that this has tainted his account.  However looked
         at in the round I find the account not credible."

The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge had
erred in rejecting the account of a police raid on the family home on
plausibility grounds and that this amounted to improper speculation as was
the finding that it was implausible that the police did not search the
sister's house.  It is also submitted that the father's ability to raise
the money involved was a subjective matter and not objective and was not
supported by background evidence.  It is said that the findings are thus
flawed and not sustainable.

In her submissions before me Ms Chaggar accepted that the background
evidence did show that the family members of those suspected of involvement
in PJAK and other Kurdish groups are harassed but submitted that in her
assessment of plausibility, the judge had erred in not taking into account
an important point in the appellant's evidence, which was that he had gone
to the sister's house and that there was no evidence to suggest that the
authorities would have known of the sister's house.  Ms Chaggar also
submitted that there was insufficient evidence to show that the sister
would have been known to the police or that they would have gone to her
home.  With regard to raising money she submitted that there was no
background evidence as to ability to raise funds and that the assessment
was purely subjective.

Mr Melvin submitted relying on his Rule 24 letter that the background
evidence was, as the appellant accepts, indicative that the family members
of suspects in circumstances such as this were likely to be harassed and
arrested; and, it was open to the judge to conclude that if there had been
the killing of a policeman, then they would have visited the other family
members, having spoken to the father and have received no information.  He
submitted further that in the context of the family being harassed as the
background evidence shows it was implausible that the father would have
been able to visit the agents and to raise the cash involved.

In response Ms Chaggar submitted that on the second point that was not what
the judge had said in that she had relied on background evidence and had
not drawn specific attention to any particular point.

I consider that in light of the background evidence set out in particular
in the CPIN Kurds and the evidence of the harassment to which those
suspected of Kurdish separatist involvement are subjected that it was open
to the judge to conclude that it was not plausible that they should not
then have gone on to seek the suspect at other places.  It is also evident
from the background information that it is relatively common for them to
let people go and observe their activities.  It is, however, less clear
that there would be no attempt to search cars in the area but equally I
consider it entirely rational for a judge to conclude that in the
circumstances, given the enmity of the Iranian authorities towards Kurds,
that they would not in the circumstances have increased patrols or put up
some type of searching and on that basis that finding is sustainable.

I do not, however, find that the judge's finding with regard to raising
funds is sustainable.  If the judge had said in light of the fact that he
was likely to be harassed and traced that he would not have been able to
raise funds, then that would be one thing and indeed that is the position
put forward by the Secretary of State but that is not what the judge says.
She says that she found is not plausible that he would be able to raise
money is within a few hours.  There is nothing in the background evidence
that suggests that is so and indeed the speculation that a large amount of
cash was handed over presupposes a cash transaction.  The reality is we
simply do not know the terms on which any passage out of Iran was arranged
and on that basis I consider the judge has in the somewhat confused
paragraph 23 reached a finding which was not open to her for the reasons
given.

The question then raised is whether this is material, given that the judge
has given other reasons which I have found sustainable for concluding that
the core of the appellant's claim about being wanted by the authorities is
not safe.  Is the sentence which commences with "Further" effectively an
aside?

I consider, bearing in mind what the Court of Appeal said in Lowe that an
Appellate Tribunal should be reluctant to set aside findings of fact
reached by a Tribunal which heard the evidence, that this was not material.
That is all the more so where, as here, there is no sufficient basis on
which it could be said that the judge misdirected herself as to the law.

It is clear from what the judge says towards the end of paragraph 23 that
her main concern about the account of the raid on the family home was that
it was not plausible when looked at in the context of the background
information and in particular the clear information about discrimination
and suspicion against Kurds in Iran.  On that basis I consider that whilst
the findings with regard to the plausibility of the father being able to
raise cash is not material, further, it is possible to read the phrase,
"this account is not consistent with the background evidence before me and
whilst acknowledging the consistency of the account given by the appellant
this cannot make the incredible credible" as relating to the whole of the
account, not simply the father raising cash, which by the use of the word
further at the beginning of the sentence is in effect parenthetical.

I conclude, therefore, that the reference to the raising of money was
simply one of the factors that the judge bore in mind when concluding that
the account was not plausible. It was open to her to do so, and the
reference to the cash was simply an additional reason for not believing the
appellant; she had already given adequate reasons for doing so.

Accordingly, for these reasons I consider that the decision of the First-
tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error of law affecting the
outcome of the decision and I uphold it.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error of law and I uphold it.
