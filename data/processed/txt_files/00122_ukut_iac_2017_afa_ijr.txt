                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

Mr M Henderson, Counsel, for the Applicant (instructed by Gulbenkian
Andonian Solicitors)
Mr L Glenister, Counsel, for the Respondent (instructed by GLD)


   1.    Although paragraph 353 does not refer in terms to certification,  a
      decision certified pursuant to s 94b is plainly a decision on a "human
      rights claim" albeit a claim regarding temporary removal as opposed to
      removal  for  a  more  lengthy  period  if  a  statutory   appeal   is
      unsuccessful.   In  deciding  whether  to  certify  under   s94B   the
      respondent,  and  the  Tribunal,  cannot  act  in  a  way   which   is
      incompatible with the applicant's Convention rights.  It  must  follow
      that further  submissions  made  and  considered  in  accordance  with
      paragraph  353  Immigration  Rules  would  fall  within  their  ambit,
      including the appropriateness of  certification.  Certification  is  a
      response to the human rights  claim,  albeit  focused  upon  temporary
      removal rather than the main claim.

   2. Paragraph 353 Immigration Rules provides the appropriate remedy  where
      further information and evidence is sought to  be  placed  before  the
      respondent, rather than such material  being  considered  in  judicial
      review proceedings


                                  JUDGMENT

   1. The applicant, who is a citizen of Sierra Leone born on 7  July  1982,
      was issued with entry clearance on 11 August 1995 and entered  the  UK
      on 17 August 1995, aged 13. He then applied for and, on 24  July  1996
      was granted, indefinite leave to remain.


   2. On 5 December 2003, aged 21, the applicant was convicted of  2  counts
      of conspiracy to handle stolen goods, 2 counts of theft,  robbery  and
      having a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence.  He  was
      sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment in total.  On 11 May  2004,  notice
      of intention to deport was served upon the applicant. Deportation  was
      not pursued.

   3. He was convicted of further offences:

         12  October  2007    using  disorderly  behaviour  or  threatening,
                           abusive,  insulting   words   likely   to   cause
                           harassment, alarm or distress and travelling on a
                           railway without paying  a  fare:  fine  of  �150,
                           costs of �250 and �3 compensation.
         8 April 2008  using disorderly behaviour or  threatening,  abusive,
                           insulting words likely to cause harassment, alarm
                           or  distress:  12  month  conditional  discharge,
                           costs of �60
         8 July 2008   driving a  motor  vehicle  with  excess  alcohol  and
                           failing to surrender to bail at  appointed  time:
                           fine of �250, costs  of  �50,  disqualified  from
                           driving for 12 months.
         4 September 2014  possessing controlled Class A drug (cocaine) with
                           intent  to  supply:  4  years'  imprisonment  and
                           victim surcharge of �120.


   4. On 10 February 2015, the applicant  was  served  with  a  decision  to
      deport. His representations, on Article 8 and 3  grounds,  on  why  he
      should not be deported were refused for reasons set out  in  a  letter
      dated 11  September  2015.  His  Article  8  human  rights  claim  was
      certified under s94B Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002[1]
      and his Article 3 claim was certified under s94 of  the  2002  Act  as
      clearly unfounded.


        On 15 September 2015, the deportation order was signed  and  served
        on 18th September 2015 and the  decision  maintained  in  the  Pre-
        Action protocol response letter.


   5. On 9 December 2015, the applicant made  the  instant  judicial  review
      application challenging  the  respondent's  decision  to  certify  his
      Article 8 claim. There was no challenge to the  certification  of  the
      Article 3 claim.

   6. The applicant sought and, on 18th May 2016, was granted permission  by
      Collins J in the following terms:
             The relationship with Ms Digpal seems to exist and  there  was
             material which even at the time of the decision supported  it.
             But,  as  the  rights  of  the  child  are  at  issue,  it  is
             appropriate to consider the present situation.
             The applicant has a little merit, but the test is  whether  it
             would be proportionate having regard to  the  applicant's  and
             his partner's and daughter's  rights  to  remove  him,  albeit
             perhaps temporarily.  The suggestion that  they  could  go  to
             Sierra Leone is obviously likely to be a  key  issue  in  this
             appeal.




   7. Although initially contended by the  respondent  that  the  Article  8
      claim had been certified under s94(1), this was no longer a live issue
      at the hearing before me,  the  respondent  accepting  that  only  the
      Article 3 claim had been certified under s94(1); the applicant has  an
      out of country appeal against the refusal of his Article 3 claim.  The
      Article 8 claim was certified under s94B.

   8. The letter of 11th September 2015 considers (in so far as is  relevant
      to the s94B challenge),  in  sub-headed  paragraphs,  the  applicant's
      immigration history ([3] - [8]), the reasons for his deportation  ([9]
      - [13]), 'Zambrano' ([14] - [17]),  Article 8  ([18]  -  [22]),  'very
      compelling circumstances' including  his  history  of  offending,  the
      public interest in his removal,  the  impact  on  his  family  of  his
      removal, the best interests of his children, the impact of removal  on
      his private life and his arrival prior  to  the  age  of  18  ([23]  -
      [[88]). [115] - [116] consider and decide certification under s94B  in
      the following terms:
             115.  Consideration has been given to whether your  article  8
             claim should be certified under section 94B of the  2002  Act.
             The Secretary of State has considered whether there would be a
             real risk of serious irreversible  harm  if  you  were  to  be
             removed pending the outcome of any appeal you may bring.   The
             Secretary of State does not consider  that  such  risk  exists
             because there is no evidence  to  indicate  that  you  have  a
             subsisting and genuine parental relationship with a child;  as
             noted above you were not cohabiting with your partner and your
             daughter prior to your imprisonment; or your claimed son  from
             a (sic) your previous relationship.  Further to this there  is
             no  evidence  submitted  which  would  indicate   that   there
             compelling  (sic)  circumstances  in  your  case  which  would
             prevent your daughter or claimed son from accompanying you  to
             Sierra Leone or remaining in the  United  Kingdom  with  their
             respective mothers when you are deported.  It  is  noted  that
             none of the children are dependent on you for their  right  to
             remain in the United Kingdom.  There are no compelling private
             life matters apparent:   you  may  establish  and  maintain  a
             private life to a similar standard in your country of origin.
             116.  Therefore, it has been decided to certify your article 8
             claim under section 94B and any appeal you may bring can  only
             be heard once you have left the UK.
   9. The only issue to be determined by the Tribunal is the  lawfulness  of
      the decision to certify under s94B.  The  applicant  relies  upon  the
      following grounds:
   a) "The respondent has made a material mistake of fact/failed to consider
      material  matters  and  that  relevant  material  matters   were   not
      considered."
   b) "The respondent failed to consider or apply policy/failed to  consider
      material matters relevant to procedural fairness."
  10. With regard to the first of those grounds, the applicant submitted the
      respondent had failed  to  give  adequate  consideration  to  evidence
      submitted that he was married to Ms Digpal and that  he  maintained  a
      relationship with Ms Digpal and his daughter as a  husband/father.  He
      submitted that it was plain from the evidence filed with the  judicial
      review  application  form  that  the  respondent's  conclusions   were
      unsustainable. In making this submission, the  applicant  relied  upon
      post decision evidence. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal  was
      not, when considering the lawfulness of the certification of  a  claim
      under s94B, confined only to consideration of the  material  that  was
      before the respondent on the date of the decision but should  consider
      all the material presently before the Tribunal
             "in order to assess whether the respondent's analysis  of  the
             facts is undermined by a failure to consider material matters,
             or whether the decision maker simply got the facts wrong."
         The applicant submitted that it was "particularly clear" from  the
         documents submitted with the claim form that the applicant was in a
         subsisting  relationship  with  Ms  Digpal.  The   applicant   also
         submitted that the  duty  of  the  respondent  under  s55  Borders,
         Citizenship and Immigration Act  2009  obliged  the  respondent  to
         consider the welfare of his daughter and this had  not  been  done;
         furthermore, it could not be assumed that a  correct  determination
         of the facts would have made  no  difference  to  the  decision  to
         certify under s94B.


    11. With regard to the second ground, the  applicant  referred  to  the
        respondent's  policy  on  certification  under  s94B,  as   amended
        following Kiarie and Byndloss  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1020.  Particular
        reference was made in the grounds accompanying the application,  by
        way of example, to paragraph 3.27  and  the  absence  of  a  return
        route. The applicant referred to the Ebola outbreak  and  the  poor
        travel infrastructure which, it  was  submitted,  gave  rise  to  a
        significant risk that the applicant would face serious difficulties
        and that the respondent had failed  to  consider  this  possibility
        thus amounting to a procedural breach of the applicant's Article  8
        rights.  This was not significantly pursued in those  terms  before
        me. Rather the applicant relied upon the Guidance  issued  to  Home
        Office staff on 1 December 2016, which had been produced  following
        Kiarie and Byndloss v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 1020. It was  therefore,
        it was submitted, the correct process to  be  followed.  There  had
        been no formal application to amend the grounds to include reliance
        upon this guidance. Nor was it referred to in terms in the skeleton
        argument submitted by the applicant although reference is  made  to
        the claimed failure by  the  respondent  to  follow  the  Guidance.
        Although some objection  was  raised  by  the  respondent,  it  was
        acknowledged that the Guidance reflected the Secretary  of  State's
        position following Kiarie and Byndloss[2]. I am satisfied that this
        issue is properly before me  albeit  not  raised  formally  in  the
        grounds. The issue is the lawfulness of the  s94B  certificate  and
        thus it must take account of Kiarie and Byndloss and  by  extension
        the Guidance issued by the respondent as  a  consequence.  Thus  in
        this case it is not said to be an error by the SSHD in  failing  to
        apply Policy but as the approach set out in  the  guidance  is  the
        proper approach it should have been followed but was not.


    12. On 20th December 2016, the Court of Appeal handed down judgment  in
        Caroopen and Myrie v SSHD [2016]  EWCA  Civ  1307.  I  invited  the
        parties to make written submissions if so  advised  on  the  extent
        that decision may impact  upon  this  application  and  I  received
        submissions from both parties, which I have taken into account.


        The evidence submitted by the  applicant  after  the  decision  the
        subject of challenge, in the judicial review application.

  13. The applicant did not refer to  any  authority  under  which  evidence
      submitted after the decision the subject of challenge and  not  before
      the  decision-maker,  whether   accompanying   the   judicial   review
      application or thereafter, could or should be taken  into  account  in
      the review of the decision the subject of challenge. It is plain  that
      the jurisprudence does not permit of a 'rolling review'  of  evidence.
      The decision the subject of challenge is that which is challenged.  In
      the absence of a secondary/subsidiary or supplemental  decision  which
      looks  at  any  further  evidence  submitted  whether  direct  to  the
      respondent or within judicial review proceedings which the  respondent
      chooses to consider, the respondent cannot be criticised  for  failing
      to take account of information of which she was not aware at the  date
      of the decision under challenge. It may of  course  be  that  in  some
      cases the respondent is under a duty to investigate or  enquire  prior
      to  making  a  decision,  but  that  is  not  the  position  in   this
      application. In this application, it was submitted that the  extensive
      evidence provided after the decision should be taken into  account  in
      determining the lawfulness of the certification.


  14. I do not accept that proposition. As is said in  Kiarie  and  Byndloss
      [33]

             As to the  applicable  principles  on  judicial  review  of  a
             decision under section 94B, the terms of the  statute  require
             the Secretary of State to form her own view on whether removal
             pending  an  appeal  would  breach  Convention  rights:   see,
             further, the next section of this judgment. For that  purpose,
             in an article 8 case such as the  present,  she  has  to  make
             relevant  findings  of  fact  and  conduct  a  proportionality
             balancing exercise in relation to the facts so  found.  In  my
             judgment , her findings of fact are open to review  on  normal
             Wednesbury principles........applied with the anxious scrutiny
             appropriate to the context:  compare R (Giri) v  Secretary  of
             State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 784, applying  R
             v Secretary of State for the Home Department,  ex  p.  Khawaja
             [1984] AC 74 and Bugdaycay v Secretary of State for  the  Home
             Department [1987] AC 514, and distinguishing between cases  of
             precedent or jurisdictional  fact  (where  the  court  has  to
             decide the facts for itself) and cases where facts have to  be
             found by the decision-maker in the exercise of a discretionary
             power conferred on him or her (and  where  those  findings  of
             fact are open to review on Wednesbury principles).  But as  to
             the assessment of proportionality, the decision of the Supreme
             Court in R (Lord Carlile of Berriew) v Secretary of State  for
             the Home Department [2014] UKSC 60, [2015] AC 945  shows  that
             the court is obliged to  form  its  own  view,  whilst  giving
             appropriate weight (which  will  depend  on  context)  to  any
             balancing exercise carried out by the primary  decision-maker.



  15. That post decision evidence is not at large in a judicial review of  a
      decision to certify was made clear in the observations of  Beatson  LJ
      in R (FR & KL  (Albania))  v  SSHD  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  605.  At  [56],
      discussing the decision of the House of Lords in ZT  (Kosovo)  v  SSHD
      [2009] UKHL 6, he said:
             "As to the approach of a court considering a  judicial  review
             of certification, it was stated that  the  court  was  not  to
             substitute its own view as to whether the claims were "clearly
             unfounded" but should apply the normal principles of  judicial
             review..."
         Beatson LJ explained at [49] the reviewing court  must  ask  itself
         essentially the questions  which  would  have  to  be  asked  by  a
         Tribunal considering an appeal. He referred with approval  at  [53]
         of R (FR &  KL)  (Albania)  to  the  earlier  explanation  of  Lord
         Phillips that:
             "...the test for certifying a claim as "clearly unfounded"  is
             an objective one. It depends not on the Home Secretary's  view
             but upon a criterion which a court can readily reapply once it
             has the materials which the Home Secretary had..."
         At [56]:
             "...the court was not to substitute its own view as to whether
             the claims were  "clearly  unfounded"  but  should  apply  the
             normal principles of judicial review."
         And at [[62]:
             "...the jurisdiction remains a supervisory and reviewing one."
        As was made clear in ZT (Kosovo), the question of whether or not  a
        claim is clearly unfounded is  only  susceptible  to  one  rational
        answer. The way the Tribunal can consider whether the  decision  by
        the respondent to certify the human rights claim was a rational one
        is by asking itself the same question. This does not mean that  the
        Tribunal is substituting its own decision but that the Tribunal  is
        asking itself the same question in  order  to  decide  whether  the
        respondent's decision was rational. In  doing  so  it  exercises  a
        supervisory  jurisdiction  which  is  why  it  only  considers  the
        materials that were available to the  respondent  at  the  date  of
        decision.
  16. In the absence of any reasoned arguments supported by  authority  that
      the  Tribunal  should  consider  evidence  that  was  not  before  the
      respondent on the date she took her decision, I  am  not  prepared  to
      consider the  evidence  submitted  either  with  the  judicial  review
      application or subsequently in determining the lawfulness of the  s94B
      certificate.


  17. The respondent submits that given the applicant  seeks  to  rely  upon
      further evidence then the proper course  would  be  to  withdraw  this
      application,  present  the  new  material  in  the  form  of   further
      submissions and this would be considered in accordance with  paragraph
      353 Immigration Rules. The applicant submits that  such  a  course  of
      action is not one they are seeking -  they are not seeking a review of
      the Article 8 decision but of the s94B certificate and that  paragraph
      353 does not provide for consideration of a 94B certificate.
      The relationship between paragraph  353  Immigration  Rules  and  s94B
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
  18. Although paragraph 353 does not refer in  terms  to  certification,  a
      s94B certificate is plainly a decision on a human rights claim  albeit
      a claim regarding temporary removal as oppose to removal  for  a  more
      lengthy period if a statutory  appeal  is  unsuccessful.  In  deciding
      whether to certify under s94B the respondent, and the Tribunal, cannot
      act in a way which is incompatible  with  the  applicant's  Convention
      rights. It must follow that further submissions made and considered in
      accordance with paragraph 353  Immigration  Rules  would  fall  within
      their  ambit,  including   the   appropriateness   of   certification.
      Certification is a response to the human rights claim, albeit  focused
      upon temporary removal rather than the main claim.


  19. The duty imposed upon the Tribunal by s6 HRA is not  infringed  by  it
      not reviewing post decision evidence which is said to do what the pre-
      decision evidence failed to achieve, namely establishing that  removal
      would bring about an impermissible infringement of rights protected by
      Article 8. That is because the nature of the task being  performed  by
      the Tribunal is the exercise of a supervisory jurisdiction in  respect
      of an historic decision. If there is more to be said by an  applicant,
      then the machinery of paragraph 353 provides for it to  be  considered
      by the respondent. If the applicant is correct that the post  decision
      evidence demonstrates that temporary removal would infringe  protected
      Article 8 rights, that infringement does not flow from the decision of
      the Tribunal that the decision  under  challenge  in  the  proceedings
      before it was, at the time it was taken, a lawful one.

  20. It therefore follows that paragraph 353 Immigration Rules provides the
      appropriate remedy where further information and evidence is sought to
      be placed before the  respondent,  rather  than  such  material  being
      considered in judicial review proceedings.

  21. I have in any event considered the challenge to the  s94B  certificate
      made in this application.


        Article 8 in general and under s94B  Nationality,  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002.

  22.  The respondent, in her detailed grounds of defence, states:
             ...it  is  acknowledged  that  in   terms   of   certification
             specifically, the  decision  was  made  on  the  basis  of  an
             explicit analysis of serious irreversible harm. However, there
             was significant assessment of the applicant's Article 8 rights
             earlier in the decision letter which is referenced  under  the
             certification heading. As such the decision does address  both
             section 94B (2) and (3).


  23. The assessment of Article  8  undertaken  by  the  respondent  in  the
      decision the subject of challenge is an assessment in accordance  with
      established jurisprudence of the applicant's human  rights  claim  and
      the proportionality of  the  decision  in  the  light  of  the  public
      interest in deportation of the applicant who, it is acknowledged,  has
      been convicted of very serious offences  for  which  he  has  received
      significant and substantial prison sentences in excess of four  years.
      In order to succeed in his appeal against the refusal of his Article 8
      claim in the context of his deportation, he will, in summary, have  to
      show that there are serious and  compelling  reasons  over  and  above
      those in Exceptions 1 and 2 - see s117C Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act  2002.   The  respondent  has  considered  the  applicant's
      Article 8  claim  in  accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules.  That
      decision is not the subject of this application - and  nor  should  it
      be. That is a matter for consideration by the First-tier  Tribunal  in
      the  applicant's  statutory  appeal  which,  because   of   the   s94B
      certificate in this case, is exercisable by the applicant after he has
      left the UK.


  24. The  respondent  is  required  to  specifically  address  whether  the
      conditions set out in s94B  are  met  namely,  would  the  applicant's
      removal pending the outcome of an appeal result  in  a  breach  of  s6
      Human Rights Act 1998 and give  consideration  to  whether  there  are
      compelling reasons to exercise discretion. Those reasons include  (but
      not exclusively) that the applicant would  not  be  at  real  risk  of
      serious irreversible harm if removed from or required to leave the UK.
      The applicant submits it is not sufficient for the  respondent  simply
      to consider whether there is a real risk of serious irreversible harm;
      both elements have to be considered. The  respondent  submits  that  a
      failure to specifically address both elements  does  not,  of  itself,
      render a decision to certify under s94B unlawful.


  25. The respondent drew attention to the  fact  that  the  certificate  in
      Kiarie was upheld despite  it  being  flawed  for  two  legal  errors:
      firstly that he had not been notified in  advance  that  consideration
      was being given to the certification of his  claim  and  secondly  the
      decision focused erroneously on whether there was serious irreversible
      harm and failed to address whether  removal  would  be  in  breach  of
      Kiarie's procedural or substantive rights under Article 8.
        The respondent's Guidance
  26. The respondent's Guidance  issued  on  1  December  2016  explains  to
      decision makers how to consider  certifying  a  refused  human  rights
      claim under s94B. Of relevance in this application is the following:
             Consideration of evidence
             In considering whether to certify a claim under  section  94B,
             you must have regard to all known circumstances  and  consider
             all relevant information. This includes any evidence submitted
             specifically about the potential difficulties arising from  an
             out-ofcountry  appeal,  and  any  other   relevant   evidence,
             including evidence that has been submitted for  example  as  a
             consequence of further enquiries you have made. Any  reference
             to 'available information' in this  guidance  refers  to  such
             evidence.  You  are  not  required  to  undertake   additional
             research or make additional enquiries  in  the  generality  of
             cases.  The  courts  have  been  clear  [see  for  example  SS
             (Nigeria) [2014] 1 WLR  998]  that  it  is  for  the  claimant
             affected to make their case and raise  matters  of  relevance,
             not for the  Secretary  of  State  to  seek  such  information
             proactively. However, in practice, claimants will be asked  to
             provide information on the impact their removal pending appeal
             will have.
             .......
             Summary of steps in the consideration process
             You must decide whether to certify  based  on  the  individual
             circumstances of each case. The fact that it has been  decided
             in an individual case that removal from the UK permanently  or
             indefinitely would not breach human rights does not mean  that
             the you can be satisfied that removal for a  temporary  period
             pending the outcome of any  appeal  would  not  cause  serious
             irreversible harm or otherwise breach human rights.  They  are
             different considerations.  When  considering  whether  removal
             pending appeal would breach human rights, you should  approach
             the question on the basis  that  the  claimant's  appeal  will
             succeed,  such  that  the  removal  will  be   temporary   [my
             emphasis]. You should consider  whether  serious  irreversible
             harm or other breach of human rights would be caused  by  that
             temporary removal from the UK.
             .....
              How to consider breach of  human  rights  in  the  context  of
             temporary removal
              You can only certify  under  section  94B  if  satisfied  that
             removal pending  the  outcome  of  any  appeal  would  not  be
             unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act.  This  means
             that you need to consider  whether  requiring  a  claimant  to
             appeal, or to continue an appeal, from outside  the  UK  would
             breach human rights.
              ......
              If the human rights claim is based on Article 8 of  the  ECHR,
             you must consider the  effect  of  removal  not  only  on  the
             claimant liable to removal, but also on any other person  whom
             the available evidence suggests will be affected (for example,
             immediate family members such as a partner and/or children).
              ...
             Separation
              Where the child will remain in the UK and  be  separated  from
              the claimant, you must consider whether the temporary  absence
              from the UK of the claimant liable to removal pending  his  or
              her  appeal  would  be  consistent  with  the   child's   best
              interests,  and  if  not,  whether  it  would  nonetheless  be
              proportionate or whether  it  could  create  a  real  risk  of
              serious irreversible harm to the child or otherwise breach the
              child's human rights. A  child's  temporary  distress  due  to
              separation  would  not  usually  be  enough   by   itself   to
              demonstrate that the removal of the  claimant  would  cause  a
              child serious irreversible  harm  or  otherwise  breach  their
              human rights. Many people are separated from their  child  for
              temporary periods (for example,  for  work  reasons  or  while
              serving a prison sentence) without the child suffering serious
              irreversible harm. The evidence relied upon should be specific
              to the individual child, for example the Children Commissioner
              for England's 2015 report on the Skype family discussion paper
              talks about impacts of separation  from  parents  in  children
              generally and would not by itself constitute adequate evidence
              to demonstrate a significant impact on a specific  child.  You
              should consider the nature  and  extent  of  the  relationship
              between the claimant and the child. For  example,  you  should
              consider:
                  . whether or not the claimant has parental responsibility
                  for the child?
                  . how is the relationship between the  claimant  and  the
                  child currently maintained?
                  . does the claimant have frequent and meaningful  contact
                  with the child?
                  . do they live together or  does  the  claimant  maintain
                  contact by visits, telephone calls and emails?
                  . is the claimant's relationship with the child such that
                  a temporary separation for the  duration  of  the  appeal
                  would change this relationship  to  the  extent  that  it
                  could cause serious irreversible harm or otherwise breach
                  the child's human rights?


  27. The applicant relies  on  three  additional  authorities:  R(X)v  SSHD
      [2016] EWHC 1997 (Admin), MB's Application  (Judicial  Review)  [2016]
      NIQB 75 and R (Masalskas) v  SSHD  IRJ  [2015]  UKUT  677  (IAC).   In
      Masalskas the Upper Tribunal specifically considered whether it should
      take the course the Court of Appeal took in Kiarie and Byndloss namely
      identifying that although the decision was legally flawed,  the  error
      was not material.  In Masalskas there were four young children and the
      removal of the claimant in that case from them and  their  mother  was
      considered to be significant.  In Kiarie it was noted that there  were
      no children involved.  For that reason, the error was immaterial.  The
      applicant, in the instant application, submits  that  in  Kiarie  only
      private life was engaged and that in Byndloss,  although there were at
      least seven children Byndloss had no relationship  with  any  of  them
      whereby he provided a parental presence  in  their  daily  lives.  The
      applicant submits that the facts of his  case  distinguish  his  claim
      from that of Kiarie and Byndloss.


  28. Caroopen concerns a situation where the Secretary of State has  issued
      a fresh decision.  That is not the case here. The Secretary  of  State
      submits that it  has  no  direct  impact  on  this  case  whereas  the
      applicant submits the Court of Appeal's judgment is supportive of  the
      approach they have advanced.  Caroopen is not, in  my  view,  directly
      relevant in this application given that it specifically  concerns  the
      legal relevance of  "supplementary"  letters  in  the  context  of  an
      application for judicial review of an earlier  decision.  In  [82]  of
      Caroopen, Underhill LJ, having  reviewed  the  authorities,  concluded
      that he did not think there is now any doubt about the approach to  be
      taken when a challenge is made by way of judicial review to  the  Home
      Secretary's assessment of the proportionality of  interfering  with  a
      claimant's rights under Article 8.  He referred  to  the  position  as
      being succinctly stated in Kiarie and Byndloss.   He did go on to  say
      that this does not mean that what  the  authorities  say  is  entirely
      unproblematic.  In so  far  as  Caroopen  is  concerned  Underhill  LJ
      concluded that if it was clear that the judge would have  reached  the
      same conclusion if he had  adopted  the  correct  approach,  then  the
      appeal would not be allowed (see [87]).  This reflects the position in
      Kiarie and Byndloss namely that even if a decision is legally  flawed,
      there is an inherent discretion as to the remedy.

  29. The factual conclusions drawn by the respondent are as follows:

    . The applicant is not married to Ms Digpal and they were not cohabiting
      prior to his imprisonment. He does not have a genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship with Ms Digpal although contact has been maintained.
    . The applicant's daughter was cared  for  by  her  mother,  Ms  Digpal,
      during his imprisonment and continues to be  cared  for  by  her.  The
      applicant's absence will result in some negative emotional impact upon
      his daughter.
    . There was no evidence that the applicant's deportation would result in
      him losing all contact with his daughter.
    . The applicant does not have any contact with  his  son  or  his  son's
      mother.
  30. Those factual conclusions are made in the context of removal  pursuant
      to the signing of a deportation order, not  in  consideration  of  the
      s94B certificate.  The grounds relied upon by the  applicant  rely  on
      fresh material submitted to the respondent in order to challenge those
      factual conclusions.  The grounds do not challenge  those  conclusions
      made on the basis of the information and evidence that was before  the
      Secretary of State on the date that she made her  decision.   For  the
      reasons I have set out earlier,  I  have  not  taken  account  of  the
      subsequent evidence.  The factual conclusions in the  decision  letter
      which are not  challenged  therefore  form  the  basis  upon  which  I
      consider for myself the proportionality of  the  making  of  the  s94B
      certificate and thus  whether  the  decision  of  the  respondent  was
      rational.
  31. It is accepted by the parties that the  Secretary  of  State  has  not
      undertaken an assessment of the proportionality of temporary  removal.
      On the face of it the making  of  the  s94B  certificate  was  legally
      flawed.  Whether or not this falls within the parameters of Kiarie and
      Byndloss (and indeed Caroopen and Myrie) depends on a consideration of
      all the applicant's  factual  circumstances  in  the  context  of  the
      Guidance issued by the Secretary of State which includes in particular
      the impact of removal  on  a  partner,  children  and  himself.   This
      requires consideration of the nature and extent  of  the  relationship
      between him and  his  partner/  children  as  well  as,  for  example,
      potential difficulties that he may have in pursuing  his  appeal  from
      out of the country.  Bearing in mind that this is  a  challenge  to  a
      s94B certificate and not to the Article 8  claim  against  deportation
      and that the arena for consideration of that claim  is  the  statutory
      appeal, it is inappropriate for the Upper Tribunal in determining  the
      lawfulness of the s94B certificate to consider and  reach  conclusions
      on the issues to be resolved  in  the  statutory  appeal,  should  the
      applicant decide to pursue it. The question before me is  a  different
      one: whether, during that temporary period during which the  applicant
      is removed  and  pursuing  his  statutory  appeal  there  will  be  an
      infringement of his  Convention  rights.  I  cannot  trespass  on  the
      statutory appeal because that is not the  basis  of  the  application.
      This is why addressing Article 8 generally is not  the  answer  as  to
      whether temporary removal  would  be  disproportionate.  For  example,
      there may be circumstances when a removal of say three months may  not
      be proportionate even though the  merits  of  a  case  may  justify  a
      virtual permanent separation. The justification of removing for  three
      months, say, may not be proportionate  to  the  damage  it  causes  to
      children.


  32. I invited submissions from the parties whether the  underlying  merits
      of the applicant's statutory appeal could  or  should  be  taken  into
      account in any assessment of  the  proportionality  of  the  temporary
      removal.  Both parties indicated that  this  was  not  a  matter  that
      either had pleaded, one way or  the  other,  and  they  did  not  have
      specific instructions but that their  view  was  that  the  underlying
      merits of the statutory appeal play no part in the assessment  of  the
      proportionality of temporary removal given the  Guidance  states  that
      when considering  removal  pending  appeal,  the  question  should  be
      approached on the basis that the claimant's appeal would succeed.  For
      the reasons I have set out in paragraph 31 above, I have  adopted  the
      approach that the applicant is to be treated as a person whose  appeal
      will succeed and his removal will be temporary.

  33. The focus of consideration of a challenge to a s94B certificate is  on
      the applicant's protected rights  but  in  the  context,  as  per  the
      Guidance, that his appeal will succeed to the extent that removal will
      be temporary. I am concerned with whether temporary removal during the
      appeal period  is  in  itself  a  disproportionate  interference  with
      protected article 8 rights.
        The application of these principles to the applicant's case
  34. In this  case  this  applicant  is  neither  married  to  nor  was  he
      cohabiting with Ms Digpal prior to his imprisonment. Although they are
      in contact with each other they do not have a genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship. He has no contact with his son or his son's mother.  His
      daughter continues to be cared for by her mother, Ms Digpal.  Although
      his absence from the UK  would  result  in  some  "negative  emotional
      impact" (as accepted  by  the  respondent)  there  was,  in  fact,  no
      evidence before the Secretary of State that his temporary removal from
      the UK would be any different or  worse  for  her  than  when  he  was
      removed from society whilst he was in prison. There  was  no  evidence
      before the Secretary of State which would enable a  conclusion  to  be
      drawn  that   the   applicant's   temporary   removal   would   be   a
      disproportionate  interference  with  either  his  or  his  daughter's
      Article 8 rights.


  35.  Insofar as the difficulties relating to pursuing  an  appeal  out  of
      country  which,  in  the  application  grounds   concerned   transport
      difficulties and potential health problems this was not relied upon in
      the hearing before me. In any  event  the  decision  considered  these
      matters and the challenge such as it is in the grounds is no more than
      a disagreement with those findings.

  36. The question is, therefore, whether it would be  a  breach  of  s6  to
      remove the applicant temporarily. This was not answered  in  terms  by
      the respondent but the facts upon which an answer could be reached are
      as referred to above. At most this applicant has a lawful private life
      in the UK extending to over 10 years and established from the  age  of
      13. There was no evidence relied upon as to  what  that  private  life
      consisted of other than as set out  above,  which  was  formulated  in
      terms of family life. Irrespective of whether it is  characterised  as
      private or family life or a combination  of  the  two,  it  cannot  be
      concluded that the temporary removal of  the  applicant  from  the  UK
      during the currency of his appeal  would  be  disproportionate  and  a
      breach of s6 Human  Rights  Act  1998.  As  this  illustrates  I  have
      considered myself whether there would be any infringement of protected
      rights of any person during the appeal period  but  I  conclude  there
      would not.

  37. The applicant does not assert there was evidence before the respondent
      such as would make her conclusion  irrational.  Despite  this  I  have
      myself considered the evidence that was before the respondent and  can
      find nothing in that  evidence  that  could  rationally  suggest  that
      either the applicant or his daughter would be at real risk of  serious
      irreversible harm or  that  there  were  any  other  reasons  why  the
      respondent should not exercise her discretion  to  certify  the  claim
      under s94B. The evidence of the consequences of temporary removal  are
      as referred to above and there is nothing in there that could lead  to
      a different conclusion.

  38. The applicant ought to have made further submissions for consideration
      in accordance with paragraph 353 Immigration Rules but in  any  event,
      although  the  respondent  failed  to   approach   the   question   of
      certification under s94B in accordance with the approach laid down  in
      Kiarie and Byndloss, the evidence before the respondent at the date of
      the decision led rationally to the findings of fact made  by  her.  Of
      those  findings  of  fact,  considered   in   the   context   of   the
      proportionality of temporary removal, (absent those  relevant  to  the
      applicant's criminality and the  consideration  of  the  great  public
      interest in his deportation), it is plain  that,  had  the  respondent
      taken a decision whether temporary removal would breach s6, she  would
      have reached the rational conclusion that it would not.

  39. For these reasons the claim must fail.


  40. The applicant is to pay  the  respondent's  reasonable  costs,  to  be
      assessed by a Cost Judge if not agreed.









                                    Date 8th March 2017
Upper Tribunal Judge Coker
-----------------------
[1] 94B Appeal from within the United Kingdom: certification of human
rights claims made by persons liable to deportation
(1) This section applies where a human rights claim has been made by a
person ("P") who is liable to deportation under-
(a) section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (Secretary of State deeming
deportation conducive to public good), or
(b) section 3(6) of that Act (court recommending deportation following
conviction).
(2) The Secretary of State may certify the claim if the Secretary of State
considers that, despite the appeals process not having been begun or not
having been exhausted, removal of P to the country or territory to which P
is proposed to be removed, pending the outcome of an appeal in relation to
