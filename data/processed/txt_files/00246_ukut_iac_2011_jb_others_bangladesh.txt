Where the likely income of a family falls below the  level  of  adequacy  as
established in the case of KA and others (Adequacy of Maintenance)  Pakistan
[2006] UKAIT 00065 the shortfall can  be  met  where  there  are  sufficient
savings. The assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  savings  is  not  an
arbitrary calculation and the proper reference  is  to  the  length  of  the
initial visa. If an appellant is able to meet the requirements  of  adequacy
for the period of the initial visa, and there is no reason to  believe  that
he will not be able to meet  the  maintenance  requirements  in  the  longer
term, then he is entitled to entry clearance.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellants' appeal  against  the  decision  of  Immigration
    Judge Baker made following a hearing at Bradford on 2 December 2010.

Background

 2. The first Appellant is the wife of the Sponsor Mr M N Islam and  mother
    of the second, third, fourth and fifth Appellants who are all  citizens
    of Bangladesh born between 1995 and 2006.  They applied to come to  the
    UK as the spouse and children of the Sponsor under paragraphs  281  and
    301 of HC 395 but were refused on maintenance grounds on  3  May  2010.
    The Sponsor is working but his earnings are not adequate  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Immigration Judge wrote as follows:

         "I find that the material facts relevant  to  this  appeal  are  as
         follows.  One can only have admiration for the Sponsor in  the  way
         he has diligently and regularly built up his savings  in  the  hope
         that such would then permit his family's reunification in due  time
         knowing that his stable but insufficient level of income would  not
         permit a conventional  application  to  succeed.   However  on  the
         occasion of the last appeal made after such  a  refusal  IJ  Mailer
         made it clear in paragraph 23 of his judgment of 17  November  2008
         that savings used up over time will leave the family no capital  to
         rely on which would be unacceptable.  Further in  paragraph  24  it
         was pointed out that firm employment arrangements would have to  be
         shown to be in place before such a prospective source of income for
         the   first   Appellant   could   realistically   be   taken   into
         consideration. Surprisingly this appears to have  been  ignored  in
         the presentation of the renewed application under this appeal.  The
         numbers of prospective peoples and arrangements  therefore  are  at
         best vague and undocumented and at the least entirely  speculative.
         The Sponsor is relying on his employer who lives 25 miles away  to
         organise it all for his wife.   Not  a  very  reliable  arrangement
         perhaps.  The first Appellant's list of prospective  students  with
         the intended  terms  of  employment  set  out  and  signed  by  the
         respective parents would have been far more persuasive I suspect.

         As far as the patiently accumulated savings  are  concerned,  after
         the most anxious scrutiny I cannot accept Mr Hassan's  argument  re
         their adequacy at the date  of  decision  relative  to  the  likely
         period of leave being sought.  There  is  absolutely  no  guarantee
         that the second Appellant would indeed be able to contribute to the
         family income as and when suggested.  With the  best  will  in  the
         world finances for the family would  be  extremely  tight  and  the
         savings buffer would always  be  required  to  avoid  the  need  of
         recourse to public funds.  As such with some regret I find that the
         Appellant's have just failed to discharge the required standard  of
         proof of their case as is required.  Perhaps  with  a  more  cogent
         proof of future earnings and a higher build up of  savings  in  the
         future a successful application may be submitted.  For this  appeal
         however the Appellants must fail."

 4. The Immigration Judge dismissed the appeal under the Rules  and  stated
    that he had examined the  arguments  put  forward  in  support  of  the
    submission that Article 8 was engaged. He said that sadly mere sympathy
    is not sufficient to engage the Convention.

The Grounds of Application

 5. The Appellant sought permission to  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    Immigration Judge's treatment of the Sponsor's savings was  irrational.
    The Sponsor had available savings of about �20,000.

 6. The figures used for calculation of maintenance  by  Immigration  Judge
    Baker were that the Sponsor's  income  came  to  �256.34  per  week  as
    against a total requirement of �381.50 per week which is the  level  of
    income support that  the  family  would  be  entitled  to.   There  was
    therefore a shortfall of �125.16 per week.  �20,000 divided by  �125.16
    comes to 159.  There would be 159 weeks during  which  the  maintenance
    shortfall could be made good by the savings, which is a  period  longer
    than the period for which leave may be granted by the Immigration Rules
    under paragraphs 281 and 301,  a  maximum  of  27  months.   27  months
    equates to approximately 117 weeks.  The  savings  accumulated  by  the
    Sponsor are therefore adequate to account for the maintenance shortfall
    for the maximum period of leave (117 weeks) with a  �5,356.28  surplus.
    It must be irrational to reach a figure  of  available  funds  for  the
    period of leave applied for which is  adequate  according  to  relevant
    case law and yet to dismiss the appeal.

 7. The case of KA and Others (Adequacy  of  Maintenance)  Pakistan  [2006]
    UKAIT 00065 establishes that it is appropriate to consider  savings  in
    the calculation.  It has also been established in  Mahad  (Ethiopia)  v
    ECO [2009] UKSC 16 that third party support is available to  applicants
    to satisfy the maintenance requirements of the Rules.  An applicant may
    be supported from the savings of a third party to make up for an income
    shortfall of a Sponsor.  It must be that the  third  party  needs  show
    adequate funds only for the period for which the applicant seeks  leave
    to enter or remain and not in perpetuity.  It cannot therefore  be  the
    case that if the Sponsor himself can provide this level of  maintenance
    from his savings this support should be disallowed as not  meeting  the
    requirements of adequacy as cited in KA above, and yet  allowed  if  it
    comes from a third party.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Immigration  Judge  Blandy  on  4th
    February 2011 for the reasons stated in the grounds.

Submissions

 9. Both parties made brief submissions. It was agreed  between  them  that
    the figures stated in the Grounds of Appeal were correct. There  is  an
    income shortfall of �125.16 per week and the  Sponsor's  savings  would
    cover that shortfall for 159 weeks.

10. Mrs Brooksbank argued that the Appellant would be  entitled  to  public
    funds once  she  had  indefinite  leave  and  she  submitted  that  the
    maintenance requirements only need to be met for the initial period  of
    leave and not for the longer term.

11. Mr Hunt-Jackson  submitted  that  the  Appellants  were  applying  for
    permanent settlement and maintenance therefore needs to be  capable  of
    continuing permanently.  The Appellants would be required  to  show  at
    the end of the  initial  period  of  leave  that  they  could  maintain
    themselves adequately without recourse to public funds. It was open  to
    the Immigration Judge to find that in this particular case  the  burden
    of proof had not been discharged.

Findings and conclusions

12. The Immigration Judge erred in law by not giving adequate  reasons  for
    declining to accept that �20,000 in savings could meet the shortfall in
    the Sponsor's income.

13. This application was made under paragraph 281 of HC 395. Paragraph  281
    states that:

         "The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter  the
         UK with a view to settlement as the spouse or civil  partner  of  a
         person present and settled in the UK or who is on the same occasion
         being admitted for settlement are that ... inter alia, the  parties
         will be able to maintain themselves and any  dependants  adequately
         without recourse to public funds."

14. Although Mr Hunt-Jackson submitted that the  Appellants  were  applying
    for permanent settlement that is not quite accurate. They are  applying
    for leave, which in fact will be for a period of two years, with a view
    to settlement.

15. In KA & Others the  Tribunal  held  that  the  maintenance  requirement
    imposes an objective standard and they  rejected  the  submission  that
    adequacy was a matter purely for  the  discretion  of  the  Immigration
    Judge. The requirement of adequacy is objective and the level of income
    and other benefits that would be available if the family  were  drawing
    income support was held to be the yardstick.

16. The submission that the Immigration Judge was entitled to reach his own
    decision on adequacy without reference to any particular  benchmark  is
    not consistent with the need for some objective standard.

17. The obvious point of reference is the length of the initial leave.

18. On the other hand the argument from Mrs Brooksbank that  all  that  was
    required of the Appellants was that they show that they could meet  the
    maintenance requirements for the initial period of leave and  the  fact
    that they would be able to claim income support after they  had  gained
    permanent settlement meant that  the  maintenance  requirement  was  no
    longer relevant cannot be right. The Rule says 'will be maintained' and
    looks to the future. The burden of proof lies with  the  Appellants  to
    show that on the balance of probabilities they will be able to maintain
    themselves adequately.

19. Indeed, far from being irrelevant, at the end of the two years  of  the
    initial visa the Appellants will be required to show that  the  parties
    will be able to  maintain  themselves  and  any  dependants  adequately
    without recourse to public funds under paragraph 284(viii) of HC 395.

20. There is no requirement in the Immigration Rules that  the  maintenance
    provision can only be satisfied by the Sponsor's income.  Savings  have
    always been a relevant factor to take  into  account  and  clearly  the
    larger the sum saved the easier it will be for the burden of  proof  to
    be discharged.

21. In Mahad the Supreme Court, which was  dealing  with  the  question  of
    whether Appellants seeking entry to the UK were  entitled  to  rely  on
    third-party support  in  order  to  satisfy  maintenance  requirements,
    observed that the Rules are not to be construed with all the strictness
    applicable to the construction of a statute or statutory instrument but
    sensibly according to the natural and ordinary  meaning  of  the  words
    used. They noted that other forms of assistance and other funds besides
    the  provision  of  accommodation  were  accepted  to  be  legitimately
    available to the parties in  satisfying  the  maintenance  requirement,
    such as DLA, which the settled relative could use as he or  she  liked.
    The Court concluded that the natural meaning of the words was in effect
    that there was a requirement that the family  would  be  able  to  cope
    financially.

22. The Supreme Court did not consider that the difficulty of investigation
    was in itself a barrier to the principle that third-party support was a
    factor which could be taken into account, and considered that the  risk
    that support might be precarious was no greater than that  which  might
    arise from the ordinary vagaries and vicissitudes of life.

23. In principle therefore there  is  no  barrier  to  the  Sponsor  having
    recourse to his savings in the manner suggested in the grounds.

24. The Immigration Judge appeared to accept that there would be some level
    at which it will be possible for the burden of proof to  be  discharged
    if the savings were sufficient.  He simply did not seem to  think  that
    �20,000 was enough.  But he gave no reasons for  so  finding.  He  said
    that there was absolutely no guarantee that the second Appellant  would
    be able to contribute to the family income as she hoped. That is  true,
    but the Appellants are not relying upon  her  income  to  make  up  the
    shortfall in  the  Sponsor's.  The  Immigration  Judge  said  that  the
    finances of the family would be extremely tight and  a  savings  buffer
    would be required to avoid  the  need  to  recourse  to  public  funds.
    However �20,000 covers not only the period of  the  initial  leave  but
    also a substantial amount to cover unforeseen eventualities.

25. On the face of  it  the  Appellants  fulfil  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules in that they have a sufficient income and  sufficient
    savings to make up any shortfall for the period of  the  initial  visa.
    They are on notice that when they make an  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain they will have to meet the maintenance requirements  of
    the  rules.  The  longer  term  position  is  not  irrelevant,  as  Mrs
    Brooksbank submitted, but it is an unknown quantity. They  may  or  may
    not be in a position to do  so  depending  on  a  number  of  different
    factors. The first Appellant and possibly her oldest child may [or  may
    not] at that point to be able to contribute to the household income.

26. If the Appellants are able to meet the requirements of adequacy for the
    period of the initial visa, and there is no reason  at  this  stage  to
    believe that they will not be able to meet the maintenance requirements
    in the longer term, then they are entitled to entry clearance.

27. There is a fundamental error in the determination not addressed  either
    in the Grounds of Application or in the submissions.  Immigration Judge
    Baker said that Article 8 was not engaged.  He gave no reasons  for  so
    finding and it is plainly wrong.  This is a subsisting family unit  who
    clearly enjoy family together. The Immigration Judge erred  in  law  in
    failing to conduct a proper exercise in determining proportionality  in
    respect of Article 8.

28. The decision to refuse entry clearance interferes with the  Appellant's
    right to a family life with the Sponsor their husband/father.

29. The family have sufficient resources  through  income  and  savings  to
    maintain themselves adequately for a period of two years until they are
    faced with making an application for indefinite leave.  There  will  be
    no recourse to public funds during that period, firstly  because  their
    resources are adequate and secondly because their level of  savings  is
    such that they would not be entitled to any  public  funds.   In  these
    circumstances it is hard to see what legitimate aim  is  sought  to  be
    achieved by their continued exclusion.  The maintenance of  immigration
    control is not a legitimate aim in itself but  again,  given  that  the
    Appellants meet the requirements of the Rules  for  an  initial  period
    after which they will be required to show that they continue to do  so,
    it cannot be proportionate to exclude them.

Decision

30. The Immigration Judge erred in law and his decision is set aside. It is
    remade as follows. The appeals are allowed under the Immigration  Rules
    and with respect to Article 8.
