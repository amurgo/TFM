Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S. Tauhid, Solicitor, Hubers Law
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Md Masud Rana, is a citizen of  Bangladesh,  born  on  7
    September 1989.  He appeals against a decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Adio promulgated 14 November 2018 dismissing his  appeal  against
    the decision of the  respondent  dated  7  March  2016  to  refuse  his
    application for a residence card as the extended family  member  of  an
    EEA national.



Factual background

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on  25  October  2009  with  a
    student visa valid until 31 December 2011. He was granted further leave
    in that capacity until  30  September  2015.   On  24  March  2015  the
    appellant's leave was curtailed. On 25 September  2015,  the  appellant
    applied for an extended family member residence card. That  application
    was refused, and it  is  that  refusal  decision  which  the  appellant
    appealed to Judge Adio, and  which  is  under  consideration  in  these
    proceedings.

 3. The appellant claims to have been  dependent  upon  his  uncle,  Enamul
    Hassan Tipo, a citizen of Italy ("the sponsor"), in Bangladesh, and  at
    all material times since his  arrival  in  this  country  in  2009.  He
    provided evidence of various remittals made by his uncle in his  favour
    from Italy to Bangladesh, and contended that he has been dependent upon
    him ever since. As such, it is the appellant's case that he is entitled
    to a residence card under regulation 8(2) of the Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").

 4. Judge Adio did not accept the appellant's evidence that he  had  "lived
    with his uncle" in Bangladesh. The  judge  also  had  some  credibility
    concerns about remaining elements of  the  claimed  dependence  on  the
    sponsor.  He found that there was no satisfactory documentary  evidence
    to support the claimed remittances of �2,000 from the sponsor in favour
    of the appellant for his education in Bangladesh. In  relation  to  the
    position in the United Kingdom since the appellant's arrival, the judge
    found that any money that had been provided was in the form of "top  up
    money rather than  total  dependency".  The  judge  had  concerns  over
    discrepancies between the address at which the appellant claimed to  be
    dependent upon his uncle in this country,  which  contrasted  with  the
    sponsor's details the appellant had provided  to  the  respondent.  The
    judge accepted  that  the  appellant  is  currently  a  member  of  his
    sponsor's household in this country, but found that the  appellant  had
    only been "partially financially dependent" on the  sponsor  since  his
    arrival here.

Permission to appeal

 5. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  a  Deputy  Judge  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the grounds that the judge arguably erred in his  treatment
    of the appellant's living arrangements prior to  his  arrival  in  this
    country. The appellant's written evidence, and that of the sponsor, was
    that the appellant lived  in  his  uncle's  house  in  Bangladesh.   By
    contrast, the judge's summary of the appellant's evidence, and that  of
    the supporting witnesses, was that the appellant lived with the sponsor
    in Bangladesh. The judge found that the appellant did not live with the
    sponsor in Bangladesh and questioned the credibility of  the  remainder
    of the appellant's case accordingly. This was arguably a mistake, since
    it had never been part of the appellant's case that he lived  with  his
    uncle, but rather that he lived in a home owned by his uncle.

 6. The permission judge was  "disinclined"  to  grant  permission  on  the
    second ground, namely that the judge erred in relation to finding  that
    there was no "satisfactory" evidence of the claimed financial transfers
    prior to the appellant's arrival in this country.  Permission to appeal
    was granted on both grounds.

Rule 15(2A) application

 7. Mr Tauhid applied to adduce additional documents under rule  15(2A)  of
    the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  namely  better
    copies of the remittances in favour of the appellant from  the  sponsor
    (via the sponsor's sister) in 2009.   The application does not have the
    required explanation under paragraph (2A)(a)(ii) explaining  why  these
    documents had not been submitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  this
    form. The copies of these documents provided to Judge Adio amounted  to
    no more than rectangular blocks of grey, such was the poor  quality  of
    photocopying.

 8. The application purports to rely on Ladd v Marshall [1954] 3 All ER 745
    as authority for the proposition  that  this  new  evidence  should  be
    admitted. We do not consider any of the three criteria  in  that  well-
    known case to be met.

 9. First, it is not possible to say whether the  new  evidence  could  not
    with reasonable diligence have been obtained for use  at  the  original
    hearing. As stated above,  there  is  no  explanation  as  to  why  the
    original documents  had  not  been  copied  with  greater  accuracy  or
    provided  in  their  original  form  to  Judge  Adio,  still  less   an
    explanation as to why they were not provided in this form originally.

10. Secondly, the new evidence is not such as to have a significant  impact
    on the outcome of the proceedings, for the reasons outlined  below.  It
    is not necessary to consider the third criterion, namely that  the  new
    evidence is apparently credible, as the application fails to  pass  the
    first two hurdles.

11. In the absence of any explanation as to why these documents  have  been
    provided at such a late stage, we consider the delay to be unreasonable
    (see rule 15(2A)(b)).  This is  a  further  reason  not  to  admit  the
    evidence.

12. We do not, therefore, propose to admit this new evidence. If  admitted,
    it would only be relevant to any decision we took to remake the appeal,
    if we were satisfied that a material error of law  were  present.   For
    the reasons outlined below, there are fatal flaws  in  the  appellant's
    case which mean that it is not possible for this appeal to  succeed  on
    any basis.

Submissions

13. Mr Tauhid submits that the judge erred  at  [17]  of  his  decision  by
    stating that there was "no documentary evidence to  support  the  �2000
    given to the appellant for his education", when in fact  such  evidence
    existed at pages 69 to 70 of the appellant's bundle. There is no  merit
    to this ground. The judge's remarks at [17] must  be  viewed  alongside
    his concerns that the quality of that documentary  evidence;  at  [19],
    the  judge  said  there  was  no  "satisfactory"  documentary  evidence
    concerning the claimed transfers. He repeated that finding later on  in
    the same paragraph: "there is simply no satisfactory evidence that  any
    money was  transferred  to  the  appellant  whilst  he  was  living  in
    Bangladesh".

14. Mr Tauhid also relies on the grounds  concerning  the  judge's  mistake
    concerning the evidence surrounding the appellant's living arrangements
    in Bangladesh. The appellant's  evidence  was  that  he  lived  in  his
    uncle's house, not that he lived with his uncle.  As  such,  the  judge
    erred when finding that the  appellant's  case  lacked  credibility  on
    account of inconsistencies surrounding this issue.

15. The presenting officer submitted that Judge Adio's analysis did feature
    some confusion, but that ultimately he reached the decision  which  was
    open to him on the evidence.

16. At the hearing, we asked Mr Tauhid to confirm when the  sponsor  became
    an Italian citizen.   Documents contained  in  the  appellant's  bundle
    suggested that this was in September 2014. After  taking  instructions,
    Mr Tauhid confirmed that this was the position: the sponsor  became  an
    Italian citizen in September 2014.

17. Mr Tauhid sought to rely on Rahman and Others Case C-83/11 as authority
    for  the  proposition  that  the  appellant  met  all  requirements  of
    dependency upon a Union citizen. In response,  the  presenting  officer
    submitted that even if dependency in Bangladesh  were  established,  it
    would  not  be  possible  for  the  appellant  to  succeed   in   these
    proceedings. The requirement for  dependence  is  predicated  upon  the
    sponsor being a Union citizen at the  relevant  time.  Dependency  must
    exist in the country of origin, and continue in the host member  state.
    Taking the appellant's case at  its  highest,  submits  the  presenting
    officer, it is not possible for this appellant to have  been  dependent
    on a Union citizen prior to his arrival in this country, for the simple
    reason that it was not for a further five years until the sponsor  even
    became an EEA national. The presenting officer accepted that  arguments
    on this issue were not canvassed before Judge  Adio,  but  nevertheless
    submitted that it was a relevant consideration.

Legal framework

18. This appeal is governed by the 2006  Regulations,  the  decision  under
    challenge having been taken prior to the making and coming  into  force
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

19. To qualify for a residence card as an "extended family member",  it  is
    first necessary to meet the criteria contained in  regulation  8(2)  of
    the 2006 Regulations. At the relevant time, that paragraph provided:

         "(2) A person satisfies the condition  in  this  paragraph  if  the
         person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse  or  his  civil
         partner and-

             (a)  the person is residing in a country other than the United
             Kingdom and is dependent upon the EEA national or is a  member
             of his household;

             (b)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a)  and
             is accompanying the EEA national  to  the  United  Kingdom  or
             wishes to join him there; or

             (c)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a),  has
             joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to
             be dependent upon him or to be a member of his household."

20. If a person meets the criteria to be categorised as an "extended family
    member", there are two further conditions before a right to reside will
    be conferred.  First, the EEA sponsor  must  be  a  "qualified  person"
    under the 2006  Regulations,  pursuant  to  the  criteria  set  out  in
    regulation 6.  This is often  termed      "exercising  Treaty  rights",
    given the entitlement to do so conferred by the EU Treaties.  Secondly,
    it must, in all the circumstances, be appropriate to issue a  residence
    card.  See regulation 17(4).

Analysis

21. We agree that the judge appears  to  have  erred  in  relation  to  his
    treatment  of  the   appellant's   evidence   concerning   his   living
    arrangements in Bangladesh. The appellant  in  his  statement,  and  in
    additional oral evidence before the judge, said that he lived in a home
    owned by his uncle, the sponsor, in Bangladesh. The judge's  record  of
    proceedings records the appellant as having given  additional  evidence
    in chief to that effect. As such, the judge does appear to  have  erred
    in the way he recorded the additional evidence in chief at [6] when  he
    stated that the appellant said he lived with his uncle. Similarly,  the
    judge appears to have erred when blurring the distinction  in  relation
    to the evidence given by the appellant's mother.

22. The above error was not material, for three reasons.

23. First, it is necessary for the claimed dependence to have commenced  in
    Bangladesh, and to have continued in this country.  The requirement for
    dependence is continuous.  At [18], the  judge  addressed  the  claimed
    dependency in this country. The judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had
    worked and supported himself  at  times  while  living  in  the  United
    Kingdom. He stated that the financial support from the sponsor  was  in
    the form of "top up money". There had been a  large  payment  into  the
    appellant's account at around the time of the  application.  The  judge
    found that that was either a gift,  or  an  amount  "to  try  and  show
    dependency by the  appellant".  The  judge  expressed  concern  at  the
    addresses provided by the appellant, which  were  not  consistent  with
    those he had given to the respondent. The judge  did  accept  that  the
    appellant is currently a member of the sponsor's  household,  but  that
    cannot take matters any further. The judge found the appellant to  have
    been partially financially dependent on the sponsor,  but  not  at  all
    material times.  These findings were not impugned  by  Mr  Tauhid;  the
    grounds of appeal went only to the Judge's treatment of the appellant's
    living  arrangements  in  Bangladesh,  and  the  financial  remittances
    covering that period.

24. In isolation, the above findings of Judge Adio would  be  a  sufficient
    basis upon which to dismiss the appellant's case,  even  putting  aside
    the issue concerning the claimed dependency in Bangladesh.

25. Secondly, we do not consider the judge to have erred in relation to his
    treatment of the  remittances  to  the  sponsor's  sister,  for  onward
    transmission to the appellant, in Bangladesh.  The judge  properly  had
    regard to the quality of the evidence provided to him, namely two large
    blocks of greyscale with no apparent detail, at pages 69 to 70  of  the
    appellant's bundle. It was entirely within the range of responses  open
    to the judge to find that such  evidence  was  not  "satisfactory".  We
    agree with the views of the judge granting permission that there is  no
    merit to this ground.

26. Thirdly, and most significantly, it is not possible for  the  appellant
    to succeed as an extended family member in relation to  his  dependence
    on the sponsor, even were the case that the above deficiencies were not
    present. This is because the sponsor only became  an  EEA  national  in
    September 2014.  The requirement  for  dependency  in  the  country  of
    origin presupposes that the person upon whom an applicant is  dependent
    is an EEA national.

27. Mr Tauhid's reliance on Rahman  does  not  take  matters  any  further;
    indeed, it confirms that the appellant cannot succeed on  this  factual
    matrix.   That  case  concerned  whether  the  requirement   of   prior
    dependency upon  a  Union  citizen  must  have  existed  in  the  Union
    citizen's Member State of origin, before the  Union  citizen  exercised
    free movement rights to reside in the host  Member  State.   The  Court
    held at [31] that there is nothing  in  Directive  2004/38/EC  (the  EU
    regime implemented by  the  2006  Regulations)  which  meant  that  the
    dependent extended family member must have resided in the same  country
    as the Union citizen prior to the latter's  move  to  the  host  Member
    State.  The Court, however, was clear at [33] that, "the  situation  of
    dependence must exist, in the country  from  which  the  family  member
    concerned comes, at the time when he applies to join the Union  citizen
    on whom he is dependent".  So much is clear from the  second  operative
    paragraph of the judgment's conclusions:

         "2.  In order to fall within the category, referred to  in  Article
         3(2) of Directive 2004/38, of family members who  are  'dependants'
         of a Union citizen, the situation of dependence must exist  in  the
         country from which the family member concerned comes, at  the  very
         least at the time when he applies to join the Union citizen on whom
         he is dependent."


28. Inherent to the above approach is the fundamental requirement that  the
    prior dependency must be in relation to a Union  citizen  (or,  in  the
    parlance of the 2006 Regulations, "an  EEA  national").   There  is  no
    scope for dependency in the country of origin  to  be  in  relation  to
    another third country national who later naturalises,  but  only  after
    the putative third country family member has also  moved  to  the  host
    Member State.  What Rahman emphasises is the requirement for dependence
    upon a Union citizen to exist in the  country  of  origin.   Where,  as
    here, there is claimed dependency upon a third country  national,  that
    is a situation that is wholly outside the scope of Directive 2004/38/EC
    and the 2006 Regulations.

29. Were it the case that the appellant had been dependent in Bangladesh on
    the sponsor after the sponsor's acquisition of Italian citizenship, the
    position may be different.  However, as the appellant had moved to  the
    United Kingdom some  five  years  before  the  sponsor  became  an  EEA
    national, it follows that the requirement of prior dependency on an EEA
    national in the country of origin cannot, by definition, be met.

Conclusion

30. Although Judge  Adio  erred  in  relation  to  the  appellant's  living
    arrangements in Bangladesh, that was not a material error.   The  judge
    found that there was no  continued  dependency  in  this  country.   In
    addition, taken at its highest, the case for the appellant could  never
    succeed as the sponsor was not an EEA national at the  material  times.
    The appeal is dismissed.


Notice of Decision

This appeal is dismissed and the decision of Judge Adio is  upheld  for  the
reasons given above.
