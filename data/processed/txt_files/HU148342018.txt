                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a South African born on 9 November 1955. She has 2
       adult children in the United Kingdom who have been granted indefinite
       leave to remain. She was granted entry clearance as a visitor valid
       until 20 October 2017.

    2. She entered the United Kingdom on 2 May 2017 and now does not want to
       return to South Africa. The claim being made is that she only
       intended coming here on a temporary basis but because of a series of
       unfortunate events the situation in her entry clearance application
       no longer applies and she cannot return to her home country.

    3. On 28 September 2017 she made an application for leave to remain on
       the basis of Article 8 rights. In support of her application she
       refers to the relationship with her children and grandchildren in the
       United Kingdom in addition to various other considerations such as
       her health, accommodation issues and finance.

    4. This was refused on 28 June 2018. Her appeal was heard by First-tier
       Tribunal Judge O R Williams at Manchester 6 September 2018. In a
       decision promulgated on 8 October 2018 the appeal was dismissed.

    5. For the appeal the judge was presented with a bundle of 89 documents
       on behalf of the appellant. This included a statement from her in
       which she claims her original intention in coming to the United
       Kingdom was to visit her children and grandchildren. In particular,
       her daughter [T], born on 20 March 1985 suffered a miscarriage. She
       states her daughter has poor mental health. She then became pregnant
       again and the appellant decided to remain as she had suffered from
       miscarriages in the past. Her baby was born on 7 April 2018. There is
       a statement from her daughter indicating her husband is in full-time
       employment and has a net income of just over ï¿½2000 per month. They
       have an older child, born on 21 June 2014.

    6. She also suggests considerable difficulties returning to South
       Africa. There is a letter dated 5 September 2018 from a company in
       South Africa stating that the appellant had been employed as a trade
       intelligence specialist and took early retirement for health reasons
       in April 2017. Her visit Visa application was made on 3 April 2017 at
       which stage she indicated she was in employment. There are various
       medical reports which indicate she suffers from severe generalised
       osteoarthritis particularly affecting her neck.

    7. There is a letter from her daughter in South Africa, [CJ] who states
       that the appellant gave up her furnished accommodation shortly before
       coming to the United Kingdom. Her daughter states that the appellant
       does not enjoy a good relationship with her husband and they cannot
       accommodate her because of this because they have limited space. In
       any event she states are moving to the United States of America. She
       also suggests she could not financially contribute towards her
       mother's expenses.

    8. Various other reasons were advanced as to why the appellant could not
       return to South Africa.it was also suggested that the appellant would
       be at risk as a single white female. There was also evidence to
       suggest the appellant's son in the United Kingdom has health issues
       and the appellant helped him.

The First tier Tribunal

    9. Although the appeal was limited to human rights grounds the judge
       correctly pointed out that the starting point was to see if the
       applicable immigration rule was met. In this regard reference was
       made to appendix FM 276 ADE(1)(vi) and whether there would be very
       significant obstacles to her integration into South Africa.

   10. The judge concluded this was not the case. The judge had regard to
       her health and found she still had adequate function to carry out
       most activities of daily living. The judge pointed out her conditions
       had been present for a number of years and had been treated in South
       Africa.

   11. Regarding accommodation, the judge referred to the evidence that she
       was no longer able to reside with her daughter in South Africa.
       However the judge took the view that financial support would be
       available from her family in South Africa and here so she could
       obtain accommodation. The judge also had regard to the situation of
       her daughter here but pointed out that her daughter had now given
       birth, her pregnancy being advanced of the underlying reason for her
       remaining. Her daughter can access health services here and would
       have the assistance of other family members. Regarding her son, the
       judge referred to the National Health Service and support from other
       family members.

   12. The judge then looked at matters outside the rules and accepted that
       family life existed as well as private life. However, the judge
       concluded the decision was proportionate, referring to the earlier
       reasons and that family members here could visit her. The judge also
       pointed out that she and her family should not have had any
       reasonable expectation she would be able to remain.

The Upper Tribunal

   13. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the judge had not
       explained adequately the conclusion at paragraph 8 of the decision
       that her family in both countries could support her. It was
       considered arguable that the judge failed to assess the evidence
       about the position in relation to her various children.

   14. Permission was also granted on the basis it was unclear from
       paragraph 21 of the decision if the judge was referring to her family
       life with her daughter in South Africa or her daughter here.

   15. A further argument was whether the judge correctly considered her
       situation to be precarious within the meaning of section 117B.

   16. At hearing it was indicated by both representatives that they were in
       agreement that the grounds disclosed a material error of law. There
       was reference to the appellant being estranged from her daughter in
       South Africa albeit the letter on file suggests the difficulty
       relates to that daughter's husband. Although there was no presenting
       officer in attendance at the First-tier Tribunal it was said there
       was evidence given in respect of this. I have considered the record
       of proceedings but cannot find anything on this.in summary, the
       common argument was that the judge failed to adequately assess the
       evidence and make appropriate findings on the claimed estrangement
       from her family in South Africa as well as the viability of financial
       support from her family in the United Kingdom.

Consideration

   17. I found the presenting officer's concession generous as this was a
       clear, focused decision. The judge correctly identified the issues
       and made key findings.

   18. Whilst I did have reservations about accepting a material error
       demonstrated on balance a slightly more detailed analysis of the
       evidence would have strengthened the decision. For instance, the
       judge does not make a specific finding as to whether or not it is
       accepted the appellant is estranged from her daughter in South Africa
       and whether she needed financial support to resume life in South
       Africa. The judge did not set out the financial details of her family
       here or make a specific finding as to whether or not it was accepted
       her family here could support her financially on return to South
       Africa.

   19. The judge did find family life within the meaning of Article 8
       existed. This was premised upon emotional dependency albeit I found
       this a generous finding in the circumstance. As the intention is that
       there will be a de novo hearing the appellant's representative should
       be aware that this finding is not being preserved.

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge O R Williams materially errs in
law and is set aside. The matter is remitted for a de novo rehearing in the
First-tier Tribunal before a different judge.

Directions.

    1. Relist for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal in Manchester
       excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge O R Williams.

    2. There will be no need for an interpreter unless the appellant's
       representative indicates to the contrary.

    3. The hearing should take no more than 2 hours.

    4. A presenting officer should attend.

    5. The appellant's representative should prepare relevant evidence for
       the First tier Judge to assess and make findings on. The respondent
       should consider any country information which may be of relevance.
       The following appear relevant:

       (i)    A focus upon whether the evidence would indicate
       insurmountable obstacles to the appellant returning to South Africa.
       A relevant consideration would whether she could nevertheless re-
       establish herself in the absence of support from family members
       either here or in South Africa.

       (ii)   Her state of health.

       (iii)  Her employment prospects.

       (iv)   Her finances.

       (v)    The cost of living.

       (vi)   Any safety considerations.

       (vii)  The possibility of financial and practical support from family
       members in South Africa and in the United Kingdom or from the South
       African State.

    6. An issue arising is whether family life within the meaning of Article
       8 exists in the circumstance. The parties should be in a position to
       address this.

    7. Regard should be had to the meaning of precariousness in section 117B
       and in light of the decision of Rhuppiah (Appellant) v Secretary of
       State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2018] UKSC 58.

    8. A hearing time of 2 hours is anticipated.
