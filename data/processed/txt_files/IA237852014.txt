                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal comes back before me following a hearing on 21 January 2016
    which resulted in my finding an error of law in  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") in respect of the appellant's  appeal,  and
    setting aside the decision of the First-tier Judge ("FtJ").

 2. I set out the error of law decision in full as follows:

         "1.  The appellant is a citizen of Benin, born on 3  January  1978.
             He claims to have arrived in the UK in August 2001.

          2. On 8 March 2014 he made an application for leave to remain  on
             human rights grounds  under  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.   That
             application was refused in a decision dated 20  May  2014.   A
             further decision was made on the same date to remove him under
             section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

          3. The appellant appealed against those decisions and his  appeal
             came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Seelhoff on 17 July 2015
             whereby the appeal was dismissed under the  Immigration  Rules
             and under Article 8 of the ECHR.

          4. The essential basis of the application for leave to remain was
             in terms of the appellant's marriage  to  a  British  citizen.
             The First-tier Judge concluded that in order for the appellant
             to be able to rely on paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM he had  to
             demonstrate that he met the substantive  requirements  of  the
             Immigration Rules.  In that conclusion the judge  stated  that
             the appellant had to meet the maintenance,  accommodation  and
             English language requirements of the Rules.  It  was  conceded
             on behalf of the appellant that he was not able to meet  those
             requirements. Accordingly, the judge found that the  appellant
             could not rely on paragraph EX.1.

          5. In the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal it is contended
             that in coming to the conclusion that the appellant needed  to
             meet the Rules in  terms  of  maintenance,  accommodation  and
             English language, the judge had erred in law because those are
             requirements set out in E-LTRP.3.1, not under R-LTRP.1.1(a)(b)
             and (d), which was the route to paragraph EX.1.

          6. At the hearing before me it was  conceded  on  behalf  of  the
             respondent that the judge had erred in law in that respect.

          7. However, it was submitted on behalf  of  the  respondent  that
             that was not an error of law that was material to the outcome.
              The materiality of the error of law was essentially the issue
             argued before me.

         Submissions

          8. Mr Blundell submitted that the appellant  was  still  able  to
             rely on paragraph EX.1, it having been agreed that  the  judge
             erred in finding otherwise.  I was referred  to  the  skeleton
             argument that was before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  dated  26
             January 2015 at [9-11] in terms of factors that the First-tier
             Judge  needed  to  consider,  but  did  not.   This   included
             evidence, as set out in the skeleton argument  at  [11],  that
             the appellant's family home was destroyed in a fire  in  April
             2014, and in which his mother and siblings died.

          9. As set out at [12] of the skeleton  argument,  the  cumulative
             factors amount to  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
             between the appellant and his spouse continuing in Benin.   It
             may be that some of those  matters  were  dealt  with  by  the
             judge, albeit in a summary form, but he had not considered the
             question  of  insurmountable  obstacles  "head  on",  it   was
             submitted.  There had  been  no  adequate  resolution  of  the
             issues raised in the skeleton argument.

         10. Mr Clarke submitted that despite the concession that there  is
             an error of law in the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
             that error of law is not material.   The  grounds  before  the
             Upper Tribunal are very narrow, simply arguing that the  judge
             erred in not applying paragraph  EX.1.   The  grounds  do  not
             raise any argument in terms of inadequate reasons having  been
             given in the judge's decision.  The finding that  there  would
             be no interference with family life by reason of the decision,
             had not been challenged.  This was an attempt  to  re-litigate
             matters not advanced in the grounds.

         11. In  terms  of  the  proposition  advanced  on  behalf  of  the
             appellant that there may be the need for  expert  evidence  to
             deal with the question of whether the appellant's  wife  would
             be admitted to Benin (in order to live there), that cannot  be
             used as a basis upon which to argue  the  materiality  of  the
             judge's error.  The judge had dealt with the issue of  whether
             it would be possible for his wife to join him in Benin in  the
             long term.

         12. In reply, Mr Blundell said that he  was  not  inviting  me  to
             conclude  that  expert  evidence  may  undermine  the  judge's
             findings.  That was a matter relevant purely  in  relation  to
             any re-making of the decision.

         13. The scope of the grounds, he submitted, established  an  error
             of law and the only proper way to consider whether or  not  it
             was material is to consider the way the case  was  put  before
             the First-tier Tribunal on paragraph  EX.1,  and  whether  the
             relevant factors were taken into account.

         My assessment

         14. It is established that the First-tier Judge erred  in  law  in
             terms of his conclusions relating to  the  Immigration  Rules,
             more particularly in the applicability of paragraph EX.1.   On
             behalf of the respondent it is argued that that error  of  law
             is not material.  On behalf of the appellant it is argued that
             it is.

         15. At [19] of the determination the  First-tier  Judge  concluded
             that he was not satisfied that removing  the  appellant  would
             interfere with his family life.  His  reasons  for  coming  to
             that view were that he had not been given adequate evidence to
             show that the appellant's wife could not settle in Benin  with
             him.  He stated that he had only been provided  with  evidence
             from embassies about routes to apply for permission  to  enter
             that country.  However, it was conceded before him that it  is
             possible to apply to extend leave to remain  from  inside  the
             country.  Accordingly, he found that the appellant had  failed
             to prove on a balance of probabilities that it  would  not  be
             possible for his wife to join him in Benin in the long-term.

         16. At [20] he said as follows:

                  "Further even if the Appellant were returned to  Benin  it
                  would be possible for him to apply for entry clearance  to
                  return to the UK.  I do not accept that it is  unrealistic
                  to expect the Appellant's wife to eventually earn  ï¿½18,600
                  as required by the Immigration Rules."

         17. He then went on to refer to the possibility of the appellant's
             wife changing occupation, or taking  additional  jobs  at  the
             weekend.  It would be reasonable to expect her to  do  so,  he
             concluded, in order to sponsor the appellant to  come  to  the
             UK.  He also referred to  the  possibility  of  the  appellant
             sitting a qualifying English language test in Benin to support
             his application.

         18. Also at [20], he concluded that the appellant's wife would not
             have significant problems integrating in  Benin,  taking  into
             account her skills in English and basic  teaching  experience.
             She would be able to seek work  as  a  teacher,  even  if  the
             economy is poor "as noted".  In the last sentence he concluded
             by stating that he did not accept therefore, that removing the
             appellant from the UK would interfere  with  his  family  life
             rights.

         19. It is also worth pointing out that at [26] he stated  that  he
             did not consider it material that the appellant had  lost  his
             family  in  Benin.   This  is  plainly  a  reference  to   the
             appellant's  witness  statement  and  the  skeleton   argument
             pertaining to the burning down of  the  family  home  and  the
             death of his relatives  in  that  incident.   In  that  regard
             therefore,  although  it  was  suggested  on  behalf  of   the
             appellant before me that the judge had not taken that evidence
             and the submissions on it into account, at least in  terms  of
             paragraph 276ADE(vi) and  the  obstacles  to  the  appellant's
             integration into Benin, it was factored in.

         20. The parties' competing submissions, it seems to me,  were  too
             narrowly focused.  In essence, albeit not  expressed  in  this
             way, they focused on the question  of  whether  there  was  an
             equivalence between the question of 'insurmountable obstacles'
             under EX.1 and interference with family life under  Article  8
             proper.  I should say that neither party drew my attention  to
             paragraph EX.2 which explains what "insurmountable  obstacles"
             means in EX.1.(b).  That subparagraph however, was  introduced
             from 28 July 2014.  On the face of it, it has  no  application
             to the decision made in this case which is dated 20 May  2014.



         21. Considering whether the arguments before me were too  narrowly
             focused, it is important to reflect on the judge's reasons for
             rejecting the Article 8 argument.  It  was  not  only  on  the
             basis that the evidence did not show that the appellant's wife
             could not settle in Benin with the appellant.  It was also  on
             the basis that it would be possible for the appellant to apply
             for entry clearance to return to the UK.   That  is  an  issue
             that goes beyond the question of insurmountable  obstacles  to
             family life in Benin.

         22. The wider issue however, is that  having  concluded  that  the
             appellant  is  not  able   to   meet   the   maintenance   and
             accommodation requirements of the Rules,  the  judge  at  [24]
             reflected his view of the appellant's inability  to  meet  the
             requirements of the Rules in the proportionality assessment in
             terms of the public interest.  If the judge  was  right  about
             the need  for  the  appellant  to  meet  the  maintenance  and
             accommodation requirements of the Rules, that would have  been
             a legitimate approach.  As we know however, the judge erred in
             his conclusions as to this aspect of the Rules.  In that  same
             paragraph, and earlier as already discussed,  he  referred  to
             the ability of the appellant's wife  to  earn  more  money  in
             order to support an application for  entry  clearance.   Thus,
             the judge's overall approach to Article 8 was informed by  his
             erroneous conclusion in relation to the need for the appellant
             to meet the maintenance and accommodation requirements of  the
             Rules.

         23. In those circumstances, I cannot see that the  decision  under
             Article 8 proper can stand.  Regardless of  the  narrow  point
             about the 'equivalence' of insurmountable obstacles as against
             interference with family life, wider issues were  at  play  in
             the judge's decision on  Article  8.   In  my  judgement  that
             requires the decision under Article 8 to be set aside.

         24. The question then arises as to whether the  re-making  of  the
             decision should simply be on the basis of the findings made by
             the  First-tier  Judge,  insofar  as  such  findings  are  not
             infected by the error of law.  It is true that the appellant's
             grounds  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  do  not  condescend  to
             particulars in terms of the insurmountable obstacles to family
             life in  Benin  relied  on  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
             However, I  do  consider  that  there  is  some  merit  in  Mr
             Blundell's contention that that issue, having been  raised  in
             the  grounds,  it  is  a  matter  that  needed  to  have  been
             determined on the basis of the evidence and  arguments  before
             the First-tier Tribunal.

         25. I do not  consider  that,  at  this  stage  at  least,  it  is
             appropriate simply to re-make the decision on the basis of the
             judge's findings of fact which are not infected by  the  error
             of law, without hearing further submissions from the  parties.
             The re-making of the decision will therefore take place  on  a
             future date.  At that further  hearing  the  parties  will  be
             expected to be in a position to make submissions  as  to  what
             findings of fact can be preserved.  In saying that, I  do  not
             rule out the possibility of receiving further evidence subject
             to an appropriate application being made under Rule 15(2A)  of
             the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

         26. The parties are to note the directions set out below.

                                 DIRECTIONS

             i.   If either party wishes to adduce  any  further  evidence,
                  that party must comply with Rule 15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal
                  Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

             ii.  In relation to any witness whom it is proposed to call to
                  give oral evidence, there  must  be  a  witness  statement
                  drawn in sufficient detail to stand as  evidence-in-chief,
                  such that there is no need for any further examination-in-
                  chief beyond adopting the witness statement.

             iii. Any further evidence must be filed and  served  no  later
                  than 14 days before the next date of hearing."

 3. As can be seen, the appellant is a citizen of Benin, born on 3  January
    1978, claiming to have arrived in the UK in August  2001.   His  appeal
    before the FtT was in respect of a decision of the respondent dated  20
    May 2014 to remove him under s.10 of the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    1999.  His appeal was on Article 8 grounds only, that is  to  say  both
    under the Article 8 Immigration Rules and under Article 8 proper.

 4. The main findings of  fact  made  by  the  FtJ  are  as  follows,  with
    references in square brackets to the paragraphs of the FtJ's decision:

           . There is family life between the appellant and his wife [19].

           . The appellant had not provided adequate evidence to show  that
             the appellant's wife could not settle in Benin with him [19].

           . It was conceded by the appellant before the  FtJ  that  it  is
             possible to apply to extend leave to remain from inside Benin.
              The appellant  had  failed  to  establish  on  a  balance  of
             probabilities that it would not be possible for  his  wife  to
             join him in Benin in the long-term [19].

           . If the appellant were returned to Benin it would  be  possible
             for him to apply for entry clearance to return to the UK [20].

           .  It  was  not  unrealistic  to  expect  the  appellant's  wife
             eventually to earn ï¿½18,600 as set out in the Immigration Rules
             [20].

           . It should be possible for the appellant to  sit  a  qualifying
             English test in Benin in order to return to the UK [20].

           . The appellant's  wife  would  not  have  significant  problems
             integrating in Benin [20].

           . The appellant is an illegal entrant who had lived  in  the  UK
             illegally for at least twelve years before making any  attempt
             to regularise his stay [22].

           .  There  were  no  significant  obstacles  to  the  appellant's
             integration into Benin, he being a national  of  that  country
             and a healthy adult male capable of working to support himself
             [26].

 5. As I have said, those are the main findings of fact made  by  the  FtJ.
    Not much was put before me by  way  of  submissions  in  terms  of  any
    suggestion that those findings  should  be  revisited,  except  in  one
    respect to which I shall refer in due course.

 6. In addition to the evidence that was before the FtT there was a further
    witness statement from the appellant dated 20 June 2016, as well as the
    Benin travel advice from the UK Government dated June 2016.

    Submissions

 7. Mr Blundell submitted that it appears that the  FtJ  accepted  at  [26]
    that the appellant had lost his family in an arson attack on his  home,
    referred to in the appellant's witness statement dated 14 January  2015
    at [8].  It was accepted however, that there was  no  protection  claim
    before the FtT.

 8. I was referred to paragraph EX.2 of the Rules, to which I also referred
    at [20] of the error of law decision.  My attention was drawn to HC 532
    and the implementation section on page 2.  Mr Blundell said that  there
    was  some  ambiguity  in  terms  of  whether,  in  the  light  of   the
    transitional provisions,  EX.2  applies,  although  he  suggested  that
    probably nothing turns on the point.

 9. I was also referred to the decision in R (Agyarko) v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440 in relation to the issue of
    'insurmountable obstacles'.

10. It was submitted that although  there  had  been  no  protection  claim
    advanced by the appellant, it had always been his case that  he  is  at
    risk in Benin from those who burnt down the family home.  The fact that
    he has a subjective fear  of  return  is  a  relevant  matter.   I  was
    referred to various documents in the appellant's bundle before the FtT.
     His fear is not only for his but also for his wife's  safety,  it  was
    submitted.

11. My attention was also drawn to an earlier skeleton  argument  dated  26
    January 2015 at [8]-[9] in terms of the extent to which the appellant's
    wife would be able to stay in Benin.  It was submitted that it was  not
    clear that the appellant's wife  would  be  able  to  remain  in  Benin
    permanently with the appellant.

12. The evidence before the FtJ was that the sponsor does not speak French.
     Her witness statement at [4] states that apart from English  she  does
    not speak any other language such as would enable her to adapt to  life
    in either Nigeria or Benin.  In this context I was also referred to the
    FtJ's decision at [20] whereby he stated that her skills in English and
    basic teaching experience could assist her to seek work as a teacher in
    Benin.  However, it was argued that that conclusion failed to take into
    account that French is the predominant language in Benin, not  English.



13. I was referred to page 96 of the appellant's bundle  in  terms  of  the
    economic circumstances in the country.   The  appellant  and  his  wife
    would have no family support on return there.

14. In addition, reference was made to the  UK  Government's  Benin  travel
    advice  in  terms  of  crime,  terrorism  and  the  lack  of   consular
    assistance.

15. Even if it could be said that there were  no  insurmountable  obstacles
    under the Immigration Rules to continuing their family life, that  does
    not rule out the  possibility  that  there  may  still  be  exceptional
    circumstances warranting a grant of leave under  Article  8.   In  that
    context I was referred to R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary
    separation  -  proportionality)  (IJR)  [2015]  UKUT  189   (IAC),   in
    particular at [23]-[24].  In other words there may be some cases  where
    requiring a person to return to their country of  origin  and  make  an
    application for entry  clearance  there  would  be  a  disproportionate
    interference with Article 8 rights.

16. It was accepted on behalf of the appellant in submissions  that  he  is
    not currently able to meet the Article 8 Rules, for example in terms of
    English language or financial requirements.  It was  accepted  that  it
    would be open to the appellant to  sit  an  English  language  test  in
    Benin.  However, albeit that the FtJ said  that  the  appellant's  wife
    would be able to make up the shortfall of ï¿½3,000 in her income in order
    to meet the financial requirement of the Rules,  the  income  needs  to
    have been earned for a stated  period  of  time.   It  is  not  just  a
    question therefore, of increasing her income.  Accordingly,  the  Rules
    could not be met overnight.

17. Mr Kotas submitted that there was no evidence that  the  appellant  had
    ever been threatened or pursued by those who had burnt down his  family
    home.  Although it is said that he has a subjective fear, the  question
    is  whether  it  is  objectively  well-founded.   On   a   balance   of
    probabilities the appellant would be able to be afforded a  sufficiency
    of protection and he would in any event  be  able  to  relocate  within
    Benin.  On his account there is no family home  anymore  and  he  would
    therefore have to relocate in any event.

18. At [26] the FtJ had concluded that the appellant was  a  healthy  adult
    male capable of working to support himself,  and  would  not  need  the
    support of family members to establish himself in Benin.

19. No evidence was produced before the FtJ that he and his wife would  not
    be able to live together in Benin.  Only  limited  information  of  any
    difficulty in that respect was provided.  No additional information has
    been forthcoming to disturb the FtJ's findings on that issue.

20. There is no basis upon which to re-open the  FtJ's  finding  about  the
    appellant's wife being able to obtain employment in  Benin,  using  her
    English and teaching skills.  There is no reason to  suggest  that  she
    could not learn French.  Integration might take time and be an  ongoing
    process but that does not mean that the appellant and  his  wife  could
    not integrate in Benin.

21. So far as Chen and Chikwamba are concerned, they relate to the question
    of the proportionality of requiring a person to apply simply to  obtain
    entry clearance.  In this case an entry clearance application would not
    succeed, a matter which goes against the appellant.

22. So far as  Article  8  is  concerned,  his  case  in  that  respect  is
    considerably weaker.  The income threshold  is  not  met,  nor  is  the
    language requirement.   The  appellant  has  an  appalling  immigration
    record.  Little weight is to be attached  to  the  appellant's  private
    life and his relationship with  his  partner  in  those  circumstances,
    under Article 8.

23. In reply Mr Blundell referred to documents in relation to  the  burning
    of the appellant's house and the fact that one individual was sentenced
    to 10 years' imprisonment but that the others remain at large.  None of
    that evidence was contested.  The appellant's subjectively held fear is
    relevant to EX.1 and Article 8.

    Conclusions

24. As regards paragraph EX.2, and whether it applies to the appeal  before
    me, it is as well initially to set out the terms of EX.2.  It states as
    follows:

         "EX.2    For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  'insurmountable
                obstacles' means the  very  significant  difficulties  which
                would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
                continuing their family life together  outside  the  UK  and
                which could not be overcome or  would  entail  very  serious
                hardship for the applicant or their partner.".

25. In relation to that addition to Appendix FM the implementation  section
    of HC532 states that that, amongst other  changes  to  the  Immigration
    Rules

         "... take effect on 28 July 2014 and apply to all  applications  to
         which paragraphs 276ADE to 276DH and Appendix FM apply (or  can  be
         applied by virtue of the Immigration Rules), and to any other  ECHR
         Article 8 claims (save for those from foreign criminals), and which
         are decided on or after that date."

26. I have considered the question of whether EX.2 applies in this case.  I
    have taken into account the decision in  YM  (Uganda)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1292,  in  which  similar
    considerations arose in relation to HC532.  The  respondent's  decision
    in this case was taken on 20  May  2014,  and  the  changes  which  are
    relevant for present purposes are said to have taken effect on 28  July
    2014.  Although I did not hear detailed argument on  the  point,  I  am
    inclined to the view that where the implementation section states  that
    the changes apply to "all applications" to which, amongst other things,
    Appendix FM applies, and which "are decided" on  or  after  that  date,
    that this means that EX.2 does apply to the appeal before me.  I do not
    consider that that part of the implementation  section  is  limited  to
    decisions made by the Secretary of State.

27. In any event, I agree with Mr  Blundell's  suggestion  that  "probably"
    nothing turns on the matter.

28. I am also of the view that there is merit in Mr  Blundell's  contention
    that it seems from the FtJ's findings that he accepted the  appellant's
    account of what had happened to his  family  and  the  family  home  in
    Benin, namely that it was burnt down by arsonists.  So much is implicit
    from [26] of the  FtJ's  decision.   Otherwise,  nothing  else  in  the
    decision indicates that that aspect  of  the  appellant's  account  was
    rejected.

29. Furthermore, before me Mr Kotas accepted that that issue not apparently
    having been challenged before the FtT on behalf of the  respondent,  it
    was not appropriate to contest it now.  Similarly, Mr  Kotas  indicated
    that he had no questions for the  appellant  in  respect  of  his  most
    recent witness statement, which amongst other things includes reference
    to those circumstances.

30. There is evidence in support of the appellant's claimed fear of  return
    on account of that incident, and as suggested in submissions on  behalf
    of  the  appellant  before  me.   At  page  13   of   the   appellant's
    supplementary  bundle  is  what  is  described  as  a  "Certificate  of
    Imprisonment" dated 21  January  2015,  referring  to  the  arrest  and
    sentence of imprisonment for a period of  10  years  of  an  individual
    accused of having caused the fire.   That  document  also  states  that
    others remain at large and are wanted.  There is a further document  at
    page 21 described as a Certificate of Fire Declaration.

31. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that he  has  a  subjective
    fear of returning to Benin on account of what happened to  his  family.
    His fear  also  extends  to  a  fear  for  his  wife's  safety.   Those
    submissions reflect the  appellant's  most  recent  witness  statement.
    There was no challenge  to  this  aspect  of  the  appellant's  account
    either.  It was however, expressly stated on behalf  of  the  appellant
    that I was not being asked to allow the appeal under Refugee Convention
    grounds or on  Article  3  of  the  ECHR,  only  that  the  appellant's
    subjective fear is a factor to be taken into account in the  assessment
    of whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family life  with  his
    partner continuing in Benin.

32. Mr Kotas submitted, and I accept, that there is no  evidence  that  the
    appellant himself has been threatened in  Benin,  whether  directly  or
    indirectly, and there is no evidence that any individuals  have  sought
    to pursue him in any way at all.  The contrary is not suggested  by  or
    on behalf of the appellant.  Furthermore, although I  accept  that  the
    appellant has a subjective fear, both for himself and for  his  spouse,
    nothing is offered by way of evidence to support that fear objectively,
    apart from the terrible events  themselves,  that  befell  his  family.
    That is not to seek to minimise the seriousness of the  attack  on  his
    family and the family home, but simply to note that there is nothing to
    suggest that there is any reason for anyone to pursue the appellant and
    no evidence that anything has ever been said against the  appellant  by
    those responsible for the death of his family.  In  the  circumstances,
    it is reasonable to conclude that in time any fear that  the  appellant
    has would abate.

33. As regards whether the appellant's wife would be  allowed  to  live  in
    Benin, she not being a national of that country  and  being  a  British
    citizen, the FtJ recorded  at  [19]  that  the  appellant  conceded  in
    evidence before him that it was possibly to apply to  extend  leave  to
    remain from inside the  country.   It  was  therefore  found  that  the
    appellant had failed to prove that it would not  be  possible  for  his
    wife to join him in Benin in the long-term.  The  appellant's  evidence
    before the FtJ is recorded at [11] of his decision.

34. Mr Blundell referred me to the skeleton argument submitted  in  support
    of the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal, in particular at  [8]-[9]
    in relation to the ability of the appellant's wife to  obtain  a  visa.
    It was submitted that in the light of the information set  out  in  the
    skeleton argument, it was not clear that the sponsor would be  able  to
    remain in Benin permanently with the appellant.

35. However, it seems to me that there is no basis upon  which  to  revisit
    the findings of the FtJ on this issue.  It  is  for  the  appellant  to
    establish his case, including in terms of the extent to which it  would
    not be possible for his wife to live with him in Benin, as  the  spouse
    of a citizen of Benin.  No further information on this point  has  been
    provided by or on behalf of the appellant since the hearing before  the
    FtT.  The appellant's evidence at  that  stage  was  that  he  had  not
    researched any further as to how long any extension of a visa could  be
    obtained for.  It is reasonable to conclude that this is a matter  upon
    which further evidence could have been provided if it is genuinely  the
    case that the appellant's spouse would not be able to reside with him.

36. I accept that the appellant would not have family support on his return
    to Benin, for reasons already explored.  There is nothing  to  indicate
    that he has other family members there.  I also accept that he and  his
    wife would have to find accommodation.  However, there  is  nothing  to
    indicate that the appellant is in anything other than good health, and,
    as the FtJ found, capable of working to support himself.

37.  Although  the  appellant's  spouse  is  a  British  citizen,  that  is
    manifestly not a sufficient basis from which to conclude that there are
    insurmountable obstacles to their  continuing  their  family  life.   A
    partner being a British citizen is written into EX.1 as a matter to  be
    established en route  to  qualifying  under  EX.1  but  is  not  itself
    sufficient.

38. There is similarly no suggestion that the appellant's wife is not able,
    at least on a physical level, to obtain employment in Benin.  I bear in
    mind that for both  of  them  there  may  be  difficulty  in  obtaining
    employment.  The appellant's wife does not speak French, and  in  those
    circumstances it may even be the case that it would be  impossible  for
    her in the short-term to obtain employment.  However, I do not consider
    that it could be said that the fact that  she  would  not  be  able  to
    obtain employment means that  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    their  continuing  their  family  life  in  Benin.   Furthermore,  that
    difficulty need only be a temporary feature of their life  together  in
    that there is no reason to suppose that the appellant's wife would  not
    be able to learn French.

39. Whilst I accept that the appellant's wife would prefer to live  in  the
    UK, that she has employment here, and is familiar  with  this  country,
    that does not mean that there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  their
    family life continuing in Benin.

40. Although the appellant in his recent witness statement  at  [8]  states
    that because his wife is from Nigeria they would be treated differently
    in the community in Benin, and that this would put a  strain  on  their
    relationship, no evidence has been provided to support that contention.
     I do not  accept  that  this  is  an  issue  which,  either  alone  or
    cumulatively, indicates that there would be insurmountable obstacles to
    their continuing family life in Benin.

41. In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied  that  the  appellant  has
    established that he comes within paragraph EX.1,  whether  or  not  the
    further explanation of EX.1 in EX.2 applies.   The  appellant  has  not
    established that there are insurmountable obstacles to their continuing
    family life in Benin.

42. I accept Mr Blundell's contention that there may be  cases  where  even
    though  insurmountable  obstacles  within  the  Rules  have  not   been
    established, there may be a case to be advanced under Article 8  proper
    (see for example Agyarko at [29]).

43. Mr Blundell sought to advance this aspect of the  appeal  in  terms  of
    what he described as the "human point of  view",  taking  into  account
    what  he  described  as  an  "ongoing  feud",  having  regard  to   the
    circumstances of the deaths of the appellant's family members.

44. I do not underestimate the personal and individual factors in  play  in
    this case, in respect of both the appellant and his wife.  I  note  for
    example, that in the appellant's  wife's  witness  statement  dated  13
    January  2015,  she  refers  to  her  own  family's  circumstances,  in
    particular that her mother died in a plane  crash  when  she  was  very
    young.  She refers to the length of time that she has been in  the  UK,
    having arrived when she was 8 years of age.

45. However, even accepting that there are reasons to go beyond the Article
    8  Rules  and  consider  the  appeal  under  Article  8  proper,  those
    circumstances do not in my judgement reveal that the  decision  of  the
    respondent amounts to a disproportionate interference with family  life
    in circumstances  where  they  would  be  returning  together,  and  in
    circumstances where they would be able to continue their family life in
    Benin.

46. There is also the option for the appellant to apply to come back to the
    UK for entry clearance as a spouse.  It was accepted on behalf  of  the
    appellant that this was not  a  Chikwamba  case.   It  is  not  a  mere
    procedural requirement for him to apply for entry clearance.   In  this
    context however, the potential length of separation was relied  on,  in
    terms of, for example, how long it would take for the appellant's wife,
    if she were able to do so, to increase her income to  the  point  where
    the maintenance requirement of the Rules is satisfied.  At the  moment,
    at least according to the evidence that was put before the  FtJ,  there
    is a ï¿½3,000 shortfall in her income.

47. There is no reason to suppose that she would not be  able  to  make  up
    that shortfall through some other supplementary employment, as found by
    the FtJ.  Whilst I accept that there will be the  need  to  demonstrate
    that income for a period of months, that does not in my judgment reveal
    a disproportionate interference with family life pending the making  of
    such an application.

48. In addition, and in the meantime, some  funds  could  be  sent  to  the
    appellant to support him in Benin whilst he awaits the  making  of  the
    application for entry clearance.

49. Furthermore, the factors in s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 need to be taken into account.  So much was accepted on
    behalf of the appellant.   The  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    controls  is  in  the  public  interest.   The  appellant  has  a  poor
    immigration history, having come to the UK illegally in 2001.

50. S.117B(4) applies in terms of the appellant's relationship formed  with
    his wife when he was in  the  UK  unlawfully.   That  relationship,  in
    Article 8 terms, is to attract little weight.  The same is to  be  said
    in respect of his private life in the UK, albeit that his private  life
    is not, in a significant way, relied on.

51. Even on a cumulative basis, taking into account all the factors in  his
    favour to which I have previously referred, I do not find that even  if
    a free-standing Article 8 assessment is undertaken, it  could  be  said
    that  the  respondent's  decision   amounts   to   a   disproportionate
    interference with the appellant's family life.  It is feasible for  him
    to apply for entry clearance and  there  is  no  disproportionality  in
    requiring him to do so.

52. In the circumstances,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  has
    established that he meets the requirements of EX.1.  So far as  Article
    8 proper is concerned, accepting that it is only  proportionality  that
    is in issue, I am satisfied that the respondent  has  established  that
    the decision is a proportionate response to the legitimate aim pursued.
     Accordingly, the appeal is to be dismissed.



    Decision

53. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision  is  set  aside,  and  I  re-make  the
    decision, dismissing the appeal.


Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek  26/08/16[pic]
