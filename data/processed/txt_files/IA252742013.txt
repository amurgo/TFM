Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss N Manyarara, instructed by Freemans solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of  Nigeria,  who  appeals  with  permission
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  Warren  L  Grant
    dismissing an appeal against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to
    remove him to Nigeria pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006 after refusing leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom on Article 8 ECHR grounds, either pursuant to paragraph  276ADE
    and Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) or on  the
    basis  of  exceptional  and  compelling  circumstances  for  which  the
    respondent should exercise her discretion outside the Rules.

Background

 2. The appellant came to the United  Kingdom  in  about  2004  with  entry
    clearance  as  a  visitor.   He  overstayed  and  made  no  attempt  to
    regularise his status here.  He was  later  joined  by  his  wife,  who
    entered the United Kingdom irregularly in  2006,  allegedly  after  the
    death of her parents.  The couple have two daughters  born  while  they
    have been in the United Kingdom, the first in July 2007 and the  second
    in April 2009.  They are now 7 and 6 years old respectively:  the older
    girl will be 8 years old in July 2015.  They have lived all their lives
    in the United Kingdom and  have  attended  nursery,  and  then  school,
    locally.  All four family members are Nigerian citizens.

 3. The appellant, his wife and children live with his brother and  sister-
    in-law.  They  are  in  the  United  Kingdom  lawfully  and  also  have
    children.  They have been contributing ï¿½200 a month to the  appellant's
    family expenses.  The mother of  the  appellant  lives  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  She is 82 and living alone, a few  minutes'  drive  from  the
    brother's home.  She has other children here too but they are  said  to
    be too busy to be her carers: the appellant says he helps  her  get  up
    and cooks for her.

Letter of refusal

 4. In her letter of  refusal  of  4  June  2013,  the  respondent  applied
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE.  She noted  that  the  appellant  had
    spent only 10 years in the United Kingdom  and  that  at  the  date  of
    decision, neither of his daughters had been  here  for  7  years.   She
    considered  EX.1  and  Appendix  FM  but  concluded  that  it  was  not
    disproportionate to expect the family to return  together  to  Nigeria.
    The respondent also considered Article 8 outside the Rules:  the family
    life was between the appellant, his wife and  children.   She  did  not
    consider that family life existed between the  appellant,  his  elderly
    mother or his adult siblings.  There was another brother in the  United
    Kingdom as well as a sister-in-law and no explanation had been provided
    as to why they could not care for his mother as they  had  before  this
    family arrived.

 5. The appellant's family life would not be affected by removal of him and
    his family members to  Nigeria  and  such  private  life  as  they  had
    developed  was  not   sufficient   to   make   the   family's   removal
    disproportionate  or  to  breach  the  United  Kingdom's  international
    obligations under the ECHR. There were  no  exceptional  or  compelling
    circumstances of the type identified in Nagre and Gulshan.





First-tier Tribunal determination

 6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that at the date of  decision,  the
    appellant could not succeed under the Immigration Rules and  that  EX.1
    did not apply because it was reasonable for the children to  return  to
    Nigeria with their parents if the family were removed.  He  applied  EV
    (Philippines) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 874 as to the best interests of the children, in which Lord Justice
    Christopher Clarke held that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  not
    erred in law in assessing the best interests of the  children  and  the
    reasonableness of removal with their parents:

           "45.  His overall conclusion  was  that  the  need  to  maintain
           immigration control did  outweigh  the  best  interests  of  the
           children. In effect he found that it was  reasonable  to  expect
           the children to live in another country. The  Appellants  submit
           that the judge did not analyse the weight to be  given  in  this
           case to the need for immigration control. But, as  it  seems  to
           me, in setting out and examining the  factors  relating  to  the
           Appellants, he was performing that exercise."

 7. In relation to Article 8 outside the Rules, the judge relied on Gulshan
    in the Upper Tribunal and MF (Nigeria) v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, as well  as  a  number  of  other
    important judgments.  He directed himself with  reference  to  the  new
    Part 5A of  the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  inserted  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014.  He concluded that any private life in the United
    Kingdom had been established when the parties were here unlawfully  and
    their status precarious and thus should be given  little  weight.   The
    family would be removed together, if at all:   there  was  no  risk  to
    their family life.  He concluded that any removal would meet all of the
    Razgar tests and would be proportionate.  He dismissed the appeal.

Grounds of appeal and permission to appeal

 8. The grounds of appeal are prolix.  In short form, they contend that the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in law in failing properly to apply paragraph
    276ADE and to  give  adequate  reasons  in  that  respect;  that  undue
    emphasis  had  been  placed  on  the  principal   appellant's   adverse
    immigration history which should not have affected the position of  his
    children, born in the United Kingdom; and that he  misdirected  himself
    in relation to the relevant case law by giving insufficient emphasis to
    the best interests of the parties two young daughters.

 9.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Martin  refused  permission  to  appeal.   The
    appellant renewed his application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Bruce granted permission because she considered that the
    First-tier Tribunal had arguably failed to have  sufficient  regard  to
    the best interests of the children and to paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  and
    associated guidance.  She stated that:

           "...Although it was not directly  applicable,  the  question  of
           whether the appellant's child  qualified  for  leave  to  remain
           under  this  provision  was   relevant   to   whether   it   was
           proportionate that they, and their  father,  should  be  removed
           from the United Kingdom."

Rule 24 reply

10. The respondent served a Reply to the grant of permission under Rule 24.
    She adopted the reasons  given  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Martin  for
    refusing permission, that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  did  have  the
    best interests of the children  in  mind  and  that  the  reference  to
    paragraph 276ADE was erroneous since the children were  not  themselves
    appellants in these proceedings but were their father's dependants.

Upper Tribunal hearing

11. At the hearing, Ms Manyarara relied on EV (Philippines) and argued that
    the First-tier Tribunal had failed  to  engage  with  the  facts.   The
    family did not understand the legal implications and were  entitled  to
    be assured that the judge had understood and engaged with the  specific
    facts of their case.  We asked Ms Manyarara to explain why she had  not
    referred the First-tier Tribunal to the  Supreme  Court's  decision  in
    Zoumbas v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  UKSC  74,
    which is binding on the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal.  Ms
    Manyarara was unable to explain that or to assist  us  as  to  how  the
    facts of this appeal could be distinguished from those in Zoumbas.

12. We indicated that we were minded to dismiss the appeal and did not call
    upon Mr Avery to address the Tribunal.

Discussion

13. This is a situation where both of the adult members of the family  came
    to the United Kingdom unlawfully and in one case clandestinely.   Their
    two children were born here, but no member of this family has had leave
    to remain and only the father has ever had any  leave  (a  visit  visa,
    which he  overstayed)  and  all  of  them  are  Nigerian,  not  British
    citizens. The children have been  at  school  for  only  a  short  time
    (although they were at nursery from the age of 3, apparently) and there
    is  nothing  particular  about  their  mental  or  physical  health  or
    socialisation.

14. The appellant's two brothers live in the United Kingdom  and  have  not
    satisfactorily explained why they, or the British care  system,  cannot
    care for his mother, whose medical concerns, as the judge  found,  were
    not particularly pressing.  He  found  as  a  fact  that  she  was  not
    bedridden and dependent as alleged.

15. We are guided in our approach to the facts of this case by the  opinion
    of Lord Hodge, giving the judgment of the Court in Zoumbas.  The  facts
    there were on all fours with the present case: the parents had  a  very
    poor immigration history, both having entered  the  United  Kingdom  on
    French passports to which they were not entitled,  and  their  children
    were at primary  school  in  the  United  Kingdom.   There  were  three
    children, aged 7, 4 and under a year.  Two of them, like  the  children
    here, had not been to their country of origin  and  had  no  experience
    outside the United Kingdom. At paragraphs [24]-[25], Lord Hodge set out
    why in those circumstances the best interests of the  children  do  not
    outweigh the United Kingdom's right to control immigration:

            "24.       There is no irrationality in the conclusion that  it
           was in the children's best interests to go with their parents to
           the Republic of Congo. No doubt it would have been  possible  to
           have stated that, other things being equal, it was in  the  best
           interests of the children that they and their parents stayed  in
           the United Kingdom so that they could obtain  such  benefits  as
           health care and education which  the  decision-maker  recognised
           might be of a higher standard than would  be  available  in  the
           Congo. But other things were not equal. They  were  not  British
           citizens. They had no right to future education and health  care
           in this country. They were part  of  a  close-knit  family  with
           highly educated parents and were of an age when their  emotional
           needs could only be fully met within the immediate family  unit.
           Such integration as had occurred  into  United  Kingdom  society
           would have been predominantly in  the  context  of  that  family
           unit. Most significantly, the decision-maker concluded that they
           could be removed to the Republic of Congo in the care  of  their
           parents without serious detriment to their well-being. We  agree
           with Lady Dorrian's succinct summary of the position in para  18
           of the Inner House's opinion.

           25.   Finally, we see no substance in  the  criticism  that  the
           assessment of the children's best interests was  flawed  because
           it assumed that their parents would be removed to  the  Republic
           of Congo. It must be recalled that the decision-maker  began  by
           stating the conclusion and then set out the  reasoning.  It  was
           legitimate for the decision-maker to ask herself  first  whether
           it would have been proportionate to remove the parents  if  they
           had no children and then, in considering the best  interests  of
           the children in the proportionality exercise, ask whether  their
           well-being altered that provisional balance. When one has regard
           to the age of the children,  the  nature  and  extent  of  their
           integration into United Kingdom society, the close  family  unit
           in which they lived and their Congolese citizenship, the matters
           on which Mr Lindsay relied did not create such a strong case for
           the children that their interest  in  remaining  in  the  United
           Kingdom could have outweighed the considerations  on  which  the
           decision-maker  relied  in   striking   the   balance   in   the
           proportionality exercise (paras 17 and 18 above). The assessment
           of the children's best interests must be read in the context  of
           the decision letter as a whole."

16. The situation here is the same.  These children  are  very  young.   If
    there were no children involved, there would be no  question  but  that
    the parents should be removed because  they  are  here  unlawfully  and
    there are no exceptional or compelling  circumstances  in  their  case.
    There is no evidence of any strong private life outside the family  for
    these  children  either  and  they   are   still   very   young.    The
    proportionality balance was correctly struck in the letter  of  refusal
    and the First-tier Tribunal did not err in so holding.

17. At the date when Zoumbas was decided, it was not necessary to deal with
    paragraph 117B of the Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   However,  that
    paragraph, with  which  this  judge  did  deal,  does  not  assist  the
    appellant since at paragraph 117B(1) the Rules now state in terms  that
    '[t]he maintenance of effective immigration controls is in  the  public
    interest' and at paragraph 117B(4) and 117B(5) that 'little weight'  is
    to be given to private life established when a  person  (in  this  case
    these parents) is in the United Kingdom unlawfully or when their status
    is precarious (as was always the case for all members of this family).

Decision

18. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision  is  carefully  reasoned  and
    neither the grounds of appeal, nor the oral submissions of Ms Manyarara
    establish any error of law therein, still less a material error of law.



19. We dismiss the appeal.
