Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Ethiopia, appeals against the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Stott promulgated 29.6.15, dismissing on  all
    grounds her appeal against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 4.3.15, to refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection  and  human
    rights claims and to remove her from  the  UK.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 18.6.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Brunnen  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    23.7.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 6.4.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. I found no material error of law in the making of the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision of Judge  Stott  to
    be set aside. Having announced  my  decision  at  the  hearing,  I  now
    provide my reasons.

 5. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows. The  appellant  claims  to  be  of  Oromo  ethnic  background,
    although she does not speak the language. The appellant's father was  a
    leader of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) who was  detained  in  2007,
    tortured, and died in detention. Following his death the appellant took
    a greater involvement in OLF activities, including  attending  meetings
    and distributing propaganda. Her brother was also an action OLF member.
    In 2012 the family shop was raided and her brother  was  arrested.  The
    following day she was also arrested, alleged to be a supporter  of  and
    financial contributor to the OLF. She was tortured and beaten daily for
    some 20 days until she was taken to hospital, where she remained for 15
    days before escaping. The following day she left Addis Ababa  and  went
    to stay with her maternal uncle in Alamghana, where she remained for  3
    weeks until she left Ethiopia clandestinely in January 2013, travelling
    with the assistance of an agent to  Sudan,  Libya,  Italy,  France  and
    eventually the UK, arriving on 2.10.13, where she claimed  asylum  when
    encountered by the police. Since arriving in the UK she has attended  a
    small  number  of  OLF  meetings.  The  appellant  fears  she  will  be
    imprisoned or killed by the Ethiopian authorities  because  she  is  an
    opposition party supporter.

 6. The Secretary of State rejected her claimed involvement with  the  OLF,
    noting she did not speak the language, had  limited  knowledge  of  the
    party, and generally gave a vague, incoherent and inconsistent account.
    Her claim to have been detained and tortured is also  rejected  because
    of inconsistency.

 7. Judge Stott accepted that the appellant had an awareness  of  the  OLF,
    but for the reasons set out between �12 and �18, found her account  not
    credible and that  the  appellant  failed  to  establish  any  risk  of
    persecution on return.

 8. In summary, the grounds of appeal submit that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge erred in law in failing to give any consideration to the evidence
    of the appellant's witnesses and the other evidence produced to support
    her claim to have been involved in the OLF.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Brunnen  considered  the  above
    ground arguable, noting that there is  no  reference  to  any  of  this
    evidence in the judge's analysis or findings.

10. The grounds also submit that the judge failed to consider the  risk  to
    the appellant on return to Ethiopia. Judge Brunnen  correctly  observed
    that this ground is predicated on acceptance of her claimed involvement
    in the OLF. "This ground only arises for consideration if the  previous
    ground succeeds."

11. Whilst an asylum seeker is not required to  provide  corroboration,  Ms
    Naz relied on SA (Iran) v SSHD [2012] EWHC 2575 (Admin), to the  effect
    that where credibility is in issue, the fact that a witness account  is
    corroborated by that of another witness can add to its credibility, and
    suggested the judge omitted to consider and  give  any  weight  to  the
    evidence supporting her account of involvement in the OLF.

12. The Rule 24 response, dated 6.8.15, submits that the  judge  considered
    the core of the appellant's claim and set out both the appellant's  and
    the respondent's cases before going on to make sustainable findings. It
    is argued that it is not necessary for the judge to  make  findings  on
    all aspects of the claim or to analyse every piece of  evidence  within
    the decision. "The fact remains is that this  appellant  claims  to  be
    from a family where the father was a leader within the OLF.  The  judge
    had found that this organisation is well developed and apart  from  the
    inconsistencies/contradictions relating to own  claimed  activities  in
    the appellant's evidence she has been unable to produce  anything  from
    the Organisation relating to her father. This taken together  with  the
    fact that the appellant appears to  have  no  knowledge  of  the  Oromo
    language  causes  the  judge  to  have  serious  concerns  as  to   the
    appellant's credibility."

13. In relation to the evidence of the appellant's friends, �8 of the  Rule
    24 response states, "Whilst it is accepted that the judge has not  made
    findings on the evidence of her friends/witnesses  it  will  be  argued
    that oral corroboration by friends  will  not  detract  from  the  core
    findings of fact made by the judge. In this situation  it  is  will  be
    argued that consideration of credibility is complete and sustainable in
    law. It is clear that the judge has taken into account the evidence  in
    the appellant's bundle and skeleton argument (p3 of the  determination)
    in reaching the conclusions drawn."

14. The evidence referred to is that of [DJ]  and  [AG],  whose  respective
    witness statements are dated 10.6.15.  The first claims to have been  a
    member of OLF since 2000. She fled Ethiopia in  2001  and  was  granted
    refugee status in the UK. She claimed to know  the  appellant's  family
    "since I was in Ethiopia they are from the same area as me in Oromo.  I
    did not meet (EK) in Ethiopia but I know which family she is from and I
    have met her family members." She first met the appellant in London  in
    May 2014, stating, "I came to know that she was from the same tribe and
    who her family is." She also confirmed that they have both attended OLF
    meetings.

15. The second witness also claims to be from the Oromo  tribe  but  cannot
    speak the language. She claims to have  been  an  OLF  supporter  since
    2005. She left Ethiopia in 2009. "I know the appellant  from  Ethiopia,
    because my sister was renting a place in the area called Awoliya  which
    is in Addis Ababa, it was near (EK's) family home. We are both from the
    Oromo Tribe. She met her  in  the  UK  in  November  2014  at  a  Oromo
    Community Meeting in [ ]. "After a while of meeting her I realised  who
    she was." She confirmed that she met the appellant at a OLF meeting  in
    [ ] on 7.3.15.

16. Both witnesses gave evidence at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing.



17. Reliance is also placed on the appellant's explanation for not speaking
    Oromo, that  she  was  raised  by  an  Amharic-speaking  housekeep  and
    attended Amharic school in Addis Ababa,  where  the  Oromo  culture  is
    suppressed. One of the appellant's  witnesses  also  stated  that  many
    Oromo people do not speak the language.

18. However, I note that the judge referred to the witnesses at �2  of  the
    decision. In addition, at �3 the judge noted the evidence placed before
    the Tribunal, including the appellant's paginated bundle. At �10(d) the
    judge  fully  noted  the  evidence  as  to  language  as  part  of  the
    appellant's case. In the same paragraph the judge also noted  that  one
    of the appellant's two witnesses was also unable  to  speak  the  Oromo
    language.  The  judge  also  considered  the  letter  from  the   Oromo
    Community. At �9(i) the judge also noted, from the reasons for refusal,
    that it is not just the fact that the appellant does  not  speak  Oromo
    but her evidence is that her father was a leader of the party and there
    would have been ample opportunity for him to teach  the  appellant  the
    Oromo language, especially as he was such  a  dedicated  and  committed
    follower. "The fact that she does not speak the  language  weakens  her
    claim," notes the judge from the respondent's case. More significantly,
    at �9(xii) of the decision to the evidence  of  the  two  witnesses  of
    meeting the appellant at some OLF meetings, but  the  judge  also  took
    into account on this issue the respondent's case that if  she  was  the
    active supporter she portrays herself to be, she  would  have  attended
    more meetings than the evidence suggests.

19. It must follow from  the  above  that  the  judge  has  considered  the
    evidence presented on behalf of the appellant and it would be incorrect
    to suggest that no notice was taken of it. It is important to point out
    that the  relevance  was  not  her  claimed  Oromo  ethnicity  but  the
    credibility of her claim of  political  involvement  and  that  of  her
    father, a leader of the party. It is in that context that the judge was
    considering her claimed OLF involvement in Ethiopia. In this regard, it
    is relevant to note that whilst the two witnesses  purport  to  confirm
    the appellant  is  of  Oromo  ethnicity  and  some  limited  sur  place
    involvement in the OLF in  the  UK,  neither  corroborate  her  factual
    account of events in Ethiopia. The  appellant  arrived  in  the  UK  in
    October 2013 but on her own account  between  arrival  and  her  asylum
    interview 4 months later in February 2014,  she  had  only  attended  3
    meetings. It was over a year after her arrival that  the  witness  [AG]
    met her, not at a  OLF  meeting,  but  a  Oromo  Community  Meeting  in
    November 2014. The only  OLF  meeting  this  witness  can  confirm  the
    appellant attended is one on 7.3.15, which is after  the  Secretary  of
    State's refusal decision. The witness [DJ] first met the  appellant  at
    the Oromo Community in May 2014 and although she stated they  had  both
    attended  OLF  meetings  together  no  date   is   provided.   In   the
    circumstances, the degree of  corroboration  these  witnesses  and  the
    other evidence can provide is rather limited and does not bear directly
    on the appellant's  claimed  political  involvement,  or  that  of  her
    father, in Ethiopia.

20. Taking the decision as a whole, I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge  did
    carefully consider all of  the  relevant  evidence  and  take  it  into
    account in reaching findings, fully reasoned in the decision. The judge
    is not required to resolve every issue or to detail  or  make  specific
    findings about each piece of evidence, provided that it is  clear  that
    all relevant evidence has been taken into account.

21. In the circumstances I find no error of law in  respect  of  the  first
    ground of appeal and thus the second ground of appeal falls away.

Conclusions:

22. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order. However, given  the  appellant's  claims,  I
make an anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
