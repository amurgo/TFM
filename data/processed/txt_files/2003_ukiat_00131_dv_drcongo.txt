Representation
For the appellant:     Mr G Phillips, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    Ms V T Dsane, Counsel



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department,  has
      been  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  against  the
      determination of an Adjudicator (Mr C  J  Deavin)  who  dismissed  the
      respondent's appeal on asylum grounds but allowed it on  human  rights
      grounds.

2.    In granting permission the Learned Vice President Mrs J A J C  Gleeson
      noted that the Secretary of State contended that the  Adjudicator  had
      not considered Mahmood [2001] INLR 1.  The present Grounds  of  Appeal
      relied on a new marriage (August  2002)  and  following  Isiko  [2002]
      IAR291, queue jumping was not to  be  encouraged.   The  Secretary  of
      State argued that the Respondent  should  return  to  her  country  of
      origin either with her United Kingdom spouse or to seek re-entry as  a
      spouse from there with proper entry clearance.

3.    The Respondent sought asylum on 11 February 2000 and  was  refused  on
      12 September 2001.  She married her  husband  in  August  2002      at
      which time her immigration status was precarious and  indeed,  as  the
      Adjudicator noted, relied entirely on the outcome of her  appeal.   It
      is  also  apparent  from  the  Adjudicator's  determination  that  the
      Respondent's husband,  who  was  also  a  citizen  of  the  Democratic
      Republic of Congo (DRC) had been granted exceptional leave  to  remain
      in the United Kingdom until May 2006 and had also been refused asylum.



4.    The Adjudicator concluded as follows:

           "57.  Clearly the appellant has established both a  family  life
           and private life in the United Kingdom with a  national  of  her
           own country.  Any removal would interfere with both her  private
           life and, more particularly, with her  family  life  bearing  in
           mind that she is expecting a child who will be  born  in  August
           this year.  Clearly such interference would have legitimate aims
           which is the maintenance of immigration control, but I find that
           such interference, at this stage, would be  disproportionate  in
           respect of this appellant, bearing in mind that her husband  has
           leave to remain in the United Kingdom for another three years.


           58.  I find that her removal, during the course of her husband's
           exceptional leave to remain, will engage  Article  8,  but  that
           there will be nothing to prevent her removal thereafter."

5.    It was Ms Dsane's submission that:

           "A situation which can create a split in the family is in itself
           an interference with the unity of the family. ...


           I believe the Adjudicator  was  right  in  concluding  that  her
           removal would interfere with the rights of her family  and  that
           the Adjudicator had all the information before him  to  consider
           the circumstances of  this  appellant  and  came  to  the  right
           conclusions.  In relation to those circumstances the Adjudicator
           had in mind, I think he said, he had considered all the  bundles
           of evidence including the personal circumstances of the  parties
           at the time."

6.    Ms Dsane further drew to our attention that the  couple  had  a  child
      born on 8 July 2003.

7.    Mr Phillips provided us with a copy of the  recent  Tribunal  decision
      of the Acting Vice President Professor D B Casson  2003  UKIAT  00093R
      (Sri Lanka) and rightly drew our  attention  to  paragraph  9  of  the
      Tribunal's determination which we set out in full below.

           "We are quite clear that the grounds of appeal in this case  are
           made  out.   The  Adjudicator  appears  to  have   ignored   the
           distinction between exceptional  leave  to  remain  and  refugee
           status.  Her statement at  paragraph  51  of  the  determination
           that:  "at the time of the marriage (the claimant)  was  outside
           the UK and had no reason  to  believe  that  she  would  not  be
           permitted to join her husband" is simply incorrect.  At the time
           of the marriage and at all subsequent times her husband was  not
           settled in the United Kingdom but only  had  exceptional  leave.
           Similarly  there  is  no  basis  in  law  or   fact   that   the
           Adjudicator's statement at  paragraph  54  that  the  claimant's
           husband cannot return to Sri Lanka and that if the couple are to
           continue to conduct a family life it cannot be in her country of
           origin.   Further,  there  is  no  evidential  basis   for   the
           Adjudicator's  statement  at  paragraph  55   that   there   are
           "currently real obstacles in the way of the (claimant)  pursuing
           from abroad an application for entry  clearance  as  a  spouse".
           The same criticism must be made of the observation at  paragraph
           56 that the  "couple  would  face  insurmountable  obstacles  to
           continuing their family life either in Sri Lanka or in the  UK".
           Neither the claimant nor her husband is a  refugee.   There  was
           and is no evidence that either of them could not  return  safely
           to Sri Lanka.  The fact that the husband has  exceptional  leave
           to remain does not mean that he cannot return to Sri Lanka.  The
           Adjudicator  has  in  our  judgment  based  her  decision  on  a
           fundamental misperception of the factual  and  legal  situation.
           Her decision to allow the appeal under Article 8 of the European
           Convention must be regarded as unsustainable".

8.    We agree with Mr Phillips that the circumstances of  this  appeal  are
      not dissimilar in that:
      i)    At the time of the appellant's marriage both were aware of their
           precarious immigration status.


      ii)   The respondent's husband was not settled in the  United  Kingdom
           but only had exceptional leave.


      iii)  There was no reason  why,  despite  the  respondent's  husband's
           exceptional leave, he  could  not  return  with  his  wife,  the
           respondent, and their child as a family unit to the  DRC,  their
           country of origin.


      iv)   Neither the respondent nor her husband are refugees.


      v)    There is no evidence that either of them could not return safely
           to the DRC.


      vi)   The fact that the respondent's husband has exceptional leave  to
           remain does not mean that he cannot return with her to the  DRC.



9.    We have therefore concluded as submitted  in  the  grounds,  that  the
      Adjudicator erred in  his  understanding  as  to  the  application  of
      Article 8 of the ECHR and his findings in this regard  must  similarly
      be regarded as unsustainable.

10.   In our view the issue  of  whether  or  not  the  respondent  has  (as
      submitted by Ms Dsane), established exceptional circumstances such  as
      to justify herself of not availing herself of the  alternative  option
      of applying from abroad for entry clearance to return to  her  husband
      in the United Kingdom does not arise.

11.   Ms Dsane submitted the findings of the Tribunal in what we shall  call
      Case 93, appeared to impose a duty on the  claimant's  husband  as  it
      would to the respondent's husband in this  case,  to  return  to  DRC.
      With  great  respect  to  her  she  misunderstands  the  point.    The
      respondent's husband, despite the grant of  ELR,  has  the  option  to
      return with his wife and their child to the DRC and for  that  reason,
      it cannot be said, as the Adjudicator in our view wrongly found,  that
      the removal of the respondent would interfere with  both  her  private
      and family life in circumstances where it is open to  this  couple  to
      return to their country of origin as a single family  unit.   In  such
      circumstances, their situation does not even approach  issues  arising
      under  Article   8(2)   that   relate   to   issues   concerning   the
      proportionality of removal.

12.   We therefore reverse the Adjudicator's decision as it relates  to  the
      respondent's human rights appeal  and  we  allow  the  appeal  of  the
      Secretary of State.
