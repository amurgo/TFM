Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Akindele, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of a First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    who, following a hearing in Bradford on 18 December 2018, dismissed the
    appellant's appeal against the refusal by the respondent  to  give  the
    appellant entry clearance and thereby refuse his human rights claim.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who  currently  resides  in  that
    country.  He wished to secure entry clearance so that he could come  to
    the United Kingdom to live with his wife and children.  There  are  six
    children.  The judge heard evidence from the sponsor, who is  the  wife
    of the appellant and the mother of the  children.   I  have  noted  the
    judge's record of proceedings.  I have also observed how he dealt  with
    the evidence on all of the relevant matters in his decision.

 3. There is in the grant of permission  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  some  suggestion  that  the
    sponsor, and by extension the appellant, may not have received  a  fair
    hearing from the judge.   I  find  that  there  is  no  merit  in  that
    suggestion, if such it be.  The grounds of permission from  the  First-
    tier Tribunal are extremely discursive and, I have to say,  in  several
    places very difficult to comprehend.

 4. Be that as it may, as well as the issue of unfairness to which  I  have
    just made reference, the challenge to the judge's decision as  advanced
    before me by Mr Akindele  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  concerns  the
    following matters.  First, it is submitted that there is no mention  in
    the judge's decision of the duty  under  section  25  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to make the best interests of  the
    children a primary consideration in determining  matters  of  the  kind
    with which we are concerned.   That  is  true.   There  is  no  express
    reference to section 55.  The decision is,  however,  the  work  of  an
    experienced judge and I  agree  with  Mr  Diwnycz,  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent, that it is in all the circumstances implicit that the judge
    would have had regard to the best interests of the children.

 5. The duty under section 55 is, of course, dependent  upon  the  evidence
    that is put forward before the decision-maker.  In  the  present  case,
    the evidence before the judge  regarding  the  children  was  extremely
    sparse.  Although the judge accepted that there are six children, there
    appears, as far as I can see, to have been  no  evidence  as  to  their
    precise ages.  There was some evidence  in  the  bundle  of  documents,
    which appears to have been handed to the judge at the hearing, that one
    of the children, C, was receiving extra support in school and,  because
    of a change in the working pattern of the sponsor,  was  struggling  to
    arrive at school, which was of concern.  The letter  said  that  C  had
    some emotional difficulties and that the school was worried about  him.
    He was somewhat withdrawn.  When the  children  were  spoken  to  about
    their father, the appellant, they became upset, in  particular  C,  who
    was said to feel the absence of his father the hardest.  That evidence,
    however, fell far short of any clinical or  other  proper  professional
    finding that there were particular difficulties with the children.

 6. The judge did note that none of the children are said by the sponsor to
    be British.  They had Nigerian citizenship and, although  their  mother
    was British, she was British by descent and therefore unable to  convey
    her British citizenship to them.  The children have all,  according  to
    the judge's notes, been born in Nigeria and, some six years ago or  so,
    a decision was made by the appellant and his  wife  that  she  and  the
    children should go and live in the United Kingdom, with  the  appellant
    remaining in Nigeria.

 7. On the basis of that evidence, I  do  not  consider  that  the  judge's
    decision should be set aside because he has failed to  refer  expressly
    to section 55.  There was in general a paucity of evidence to show that
    the best interests of the children necessarily  lay  with  living  with
    their father, the appellant, in  the  United  Kingdom,  as  opposed  to
    returning to Nigeria.  I am emphatically not saying a fresh application
    that addressed those matters directly might  not  produce  a  different
    result, either by the grant of entry clearance or by succeeding  on  an
    appeal.  However, the judge's decision has to be judged by reference to
    the material that was before the judge at the time.

 8. The second challenge advanced against the decision is that the judge is
    said by Mr Akindele to have failed to have proper regard  to  paragraph
    21A of Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.  As far as I understand
    this submission, he says that the judge should have taken into  account
    the savings of the appellant of some �13,000.  I do not, with  respect,
    accept that submission.  The judge was aware of the  level  of  savings
    and set out the relevant requirements as to savings  in  the  rules  at
    paragraph 25 of his decision.

 9. Applying those rules, it is plain that savings of  only  some  �13,000,
    when taken together with the total income of the  sponsor  of  �22,671,
    did not meet the requirements of the Rules.  On that  basis,  paragraph
    21A has nothing further to say on the matter.   Paragraph  21A  enables
    consideration to be given to other sources of income  than  savings  in
    the hands a particular person or income being earned by that person, or
    by the sponsor of that person.  So, for example, money  that  might  be
    provided by the kindness of a third party could be taken  into  account
    under paragraph 21A.  That paragraph is not, however, a  mechanism  for
    side-stepping the requirements of the  Rules  relating  to  income  and
    savings.

10. Thirdly, Mr Akindele submits that the judge  fell  into  error  in  not
    dealing with what are said to  exceptional  circumstances  outside  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  I  again  must  disagree.   The
    judge begins an Article 8 analysis of the position of the appellant and
    his family at paragraph 34 of his decision.   That  analysis  continues
    through to the end of paragraph 48.  The judge had regard in particular
    to the provisions of section 117B of the nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 in deciding whether the refusal of the claim  would  be
    disproportionate in terms  of  Article  8.   These  paragraphs  of  his
    decision in particular are, I find, relevant:-


         "44. It is argued by  the  respondent  that  the  family  chose  to
             separate six years ago and it  has  been  the  choice  of  the
             appellant and sponsor not to reunite the family in Nigeria.  I
             find that this argument carries weight.


         45.  Although Article 8 protects family life it  does  not  give  a
             family the choice of where that family life takes place.   The
             United Kingdom has a right to impose rules on  those  who  are
             not British citizens before they are allowed to settle in  the
             UK. Those rules are contained in  the  Immigration  Rules  and
             reflect the public interest in maintaining immigration control
             and the economic well-being of the UK.


         46.  If the appellant still wishes to settle in the UK it  is  open
             to him to reapply under those Immigration Rules but he  should
             carefully consider beforehand whether his  circumstances  meet
             the Rules  and  he  should  ensure  that  the  application  is
             accompanied by all the specifically required documentation.


         47.  Balancing all the competing factors I find that family life is
             outweighed by the public interest.  In all  the  circumstances
             the decision appealed against is proportionate and  reasonable
             and be (sic) justified in the interests of immigration control
             and the economic well-being of the UK."

11.  I  find  nothing  materially  problematic  in  those  conclusions.  In
    referring to Article 8 as not giving  a  family  the  choice  of  where
    family life is to take place, the judge  was  reflecting  the  relevant
    Strasbourg jurisprudence.

12.  In this case, as can be seen from the history that I  have  recounted,
    it was the choice of the appellant and his wife some six years ago that
    she should come with the  children  to  the  United  Kingdom  while  he
    remained in Nigeria, notwithstanding that the  children  had  all  been
    born in that country.  For a period of time, that was the  choice  that
    suited the appellant and his wife.  The fact that the  appellant  would
    now like to change these arrangements and come to live with the  family
    in the United Kingdom, as opposed to living together in Nigeria, is not
    a matter that compels the  respondent  to  give  effect  to  that  wish
    through the prism of Article 8.  Therefore,  for  the  reasons  I  have
    given and having regard to the evidence as it was before the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, I find no error in his decision, and therefore  dismiss
    this appeal.

13. I do however reiterate what has been said by the judge  in  respect  of
    the appellant's ability to put in a fresh  application.   I  also  note
    that the appellant and the sponsor will learn from  the  experience  of
    these proceedings what they need to do in order to maximise the chances
    of success an any future application.  In particular, there are  issues
    relating to the  children  which,  it  is  said,  lead  to  their  best
    interests being to have the appellant with them in the United  Kingdom.
    Those issues should be expressly articulated and supported by evidence.



Decision

The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
