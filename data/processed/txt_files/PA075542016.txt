                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Miss J Todd, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent refused the appellant's claim by  letter  dated  5  July
    2016 because (a) her allegations were not  credible  (�16  -  45);  (b)
    there is legal sufficiency of protection in Algeria (�46 - 79); and (c)
    internal relocation is available (�80 - 90).

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge David C  Clapham  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal by a decision promulgated on 26 April 2017, because he  did  not
    find the claim credible (�50 - 55).

 3. In terms of the Tribunal Procedure (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23  (1A),  the
    appellant's application for permission to  appeal  now  stands  as  the
    notice of appeal to the UT.  The  grounds  contained  therein,  lightly
    edited, are as follows:

      "The appellant claimed to be at risk from a non-state actor ... namely
      a stalker who proposed a marriage that she had rejected.  She  claimed
      that she had been attacked by his associates (causing  a  miscarriage)
      and that her husband had been subject to a number of false charges.

      The judge dismissed the appeal on the basis that the account  was  not
      credible ... largely on the basis that it was implausible ...

      While the tribunal does not require to  explicitly  comment  on  every
      adminicle of evidence ... it is required to apply anxious scrutiny and
      provide adequate reasons for its decision ... The tribunal  failed  to
      take into account  relevant  documentary  evidence  including  various
      court documents and medical evidence regarding the alleged assault ...
      which required to be looked at in the round along with  statements  by
      the appellant. The judge has either not taken these items into account
      or else failed to make any findings  thereon.  Either  constitutes  an
      error of law.

      Any error in the  credibility  assessment  must  be  material  as  the
      tribunal made no findings on internal relocation or  state  protection
      and in the absence of such findings, it cannot be assumed  the  appeal
      would be dismissed."

 4. Miss Todd referred to the medical  record  translated  at  p.9  of  the
    appellant's FtT bundle, which says that the  appellant  presented  with
    facial injuries on 2 September 2015; p.15, the  record  of  a  criminal
    case in which she was the  victim  and  her  cousin  is  named  as  the
    perpetrator, although she says he was not truly the person responsible;
    and pp.26-28, the record a fraud case in which her husband  is  one  of
    three persons prosecuted, but which she says her persecutor trumped  up
    against him.  She submitted that while none of  these  alone  might  be
    powerful items of evidence, they hung  together  with  the  appellant's
    account and with evidence of widespread corruption in Algeria and  were
    capable of having an effect on the outcome, yet the judge  reached  his
    conclusions without any reference to any of the  documentary  evidence.
    That was an error of law.  There had been submissions to the  judge  on
    both sufficiency of protection and internal relocation, both  oral  and
    written (�15 - 20, written submissions), and the  judge  did  not  deal
    with those issues, so error in reaching the credibility conclusions was
    material.

 5. Mr Matthews in response pointed out that the medical report  adds  very
    little, and  that  the  court  documents  say  nothing  which  directly
    supports the appellant's account.   Any  value  they  have  depends  on
    reading them on the assumption her other evidence is true.

 6. I noted that the documents were produced late.  The appellant's  former
    solicitors wrote  to  the  respondent  on  22  January  2016  (item  B,
    respondent's bundle) saying they were in process  of  having  documents
    translated yet none were provided before the decision of 5 July 2016 or
    before the FtT hearing on 10 March 2017.  There was no explanation  for
    holding them back until such a late stage.

 7. Mr Matthews acknowledged that the judge did not deal with  any  of  the
    documents.  He suggested that the appellant's case might be thought  so
    far-fetched that nothing needed to be added to the  reasons  given  and
    therefore it hung in the balance as to setting aside.  He accepted that
    it was an error not to deal with the  alternatives  of  sufficiency  of
    protection and internal relocation.  He expressly did  not  argue  that
    the decision could be upheld on those alternatives.

 8. I indicated that the appeal to the UT would be allowed.

 9. To decide the case without referring  to  or  making  findings  on  the
    documentary evidence adduced by the appellant was an error of law which
    requires the decision to be set aside.

10. It was a further error not to decide on the alternatives of sufficiency
    of protection and of internal relocation.  Mr  Matthews  accepted  that
    those issues cannot now satisfactorily be resolved without findings  on
    the primary facts.

11. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

12. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

13. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge David C Clapham.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
