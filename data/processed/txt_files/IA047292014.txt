Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance (Request Paper Appeal)
For the Respondent:    Mr Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Ghana born on 23rd November 1976.
2.   She seeks to appeal against a notice of decision  from  the  respondent
    dated 3rd January 2014 refusing to issue her with a residence  card  as
    confirmation as a right of residence under European  Community  law  as
    the ex-spouse of an EEA national exercising treaty rights.

3.   In essence the position of the respondent was that there was a lack  of
    evidence to show that the appellant's ex-spouse was a qualified  person
    at the time of the divorce.
     In those  circumstances  the  appellant  did  not  retain  a  right  of
    residence in accordance with Regulation 10(5) of the Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.

4.   As was pointed out to the appellant what was required was as follows:-

         "(1) Evidence that the EEA  spouse  was  exercising  free  movement
             rights in the United Kingdom at the time of the divorce.


         (2)  Evidence that the marriage had lasted for at least three years
             and that she and her  former  spouse  resided  in  the  United
             Kingdom for at least one year during the marriage.


         (3)  Evidence that the appellant was currently in employment, self-
             employment or economically self-sufficient as if she  were  an
             EEA national."

5.   No issue has been taken as to the latter two  requirements  but  simply
    as to the first.

6.   The appellant sought to appeal against that decision which appeal  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Blair.      It  would  seem  that  the
    appeal was determined on the papers without  a  hearing.   There  is  a
    bundle of documents that was submitted before the Judge.  There  is  an
    undated statement from the appellant  setting  out  her  situation  and
    circumstances.

7.   She entered the United Kingdom  on  17th  April  2004  and  during  the
    course of her stay met her ex-husband who  is  a  Portuguese  national.
    They formed a relationship and were married  according  to  traditional
    rights in Ghana on 11th May 2009.  The appellant was issued a residence
    card valid from 10th March 2010 to 10th March 2015.

8.   She and  her  husband  stayed  together  at  that  address  both  being
    employed.  They began to have disagreements and her  husband  indicated
    that he would be moving back to Spain for good.  She did  not  wish  to
    move with him and they mutually agreed to separate and  she  authorised
    her family in Ghana to file for a divorce.  The marriage was  dissolved
    on 20th May 2013.

9.   The application to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  upon  a  residence
    permit was issued on 1st October 2013.  There was  little  detail  that
    was provided as to the activity of  the  husband.   The  appellant  had
    submitted a number of documents  seeking  to  show  that  he  had  been
    exercising treaty rights as at the time of  the  divorce.   There  were
    four HMRC self-assessment tax calculations spanning  the  period  April
    2009 to  April  2013.   They  purported  to  show  profits  from  self-
    employment of �3,500, �3,900, �4,950 and �3,500.  It was submitted that
    that was sufficient to show that her ex-husband  was  at  the  material
    time a qualified person exercising treaty rights.

10.  The documents themselves are far from helpful.  Essentially no tax  had
    to be paid on any of those assessments.  There was little indication as
    to  what  occupation  if  any   was   followed   by   the   ex-husband.
    Significantly something that perhaps could have been easily  stated  by
    the appellant in her statement was not, namely by  the  nature  of  her
    husband's work.

11.  By contrast the appellant has put in detailed wage  slips  for  herself
    showing her work with Home From Hospital Limited and for the most  part
    the documents that are submitted in the  bundle  that  was  before  the
    Judge are essentially her qualifications and her working.

12.  By way of example there is a P60 for the appellant for the year  ending
    5th April 2012 showing �18,286 by way of employment  with  the  various
    payslips to Cambuslodge UK Limited submitted.

13.  The only other document of relevance to her former husband is noted  by
    the Judge. That is the national  insurance  contribution  letter  dated
    30th March 2013 giving a summary of outstanding liabilities  from  2009
    to 2013.  They amount to very little indeed and are predicated  on  the
    basis that the appellant was still  self-employed  when  these  charges
    were incurred.  The letter itself says the payment due �455.95 "tell us
    now if you are no longer self-employed as you may not owe this".

14.  The Judge noted that the documentation preceded the date of divorce  in
    any event.  The Judge noted paragraph 14 EA  ("Revocation  of  Retained
    Rights") Syria [2011] UKUT 00165 (IAC).  The Judge noted that the focus
    of this appeal was of the spouse's status as a worker at  the  date  of
    divorce.  The Judge did not consider that the documents that  had  been
    presented amounted to sufficient evidence that her ex-spouse was indeed
    employed or working at the time of the divorce.   Indeed  he  may  have
    ceased  self-employment  before  making  belated   national   insurance
    contributions and there was no clarification as to  what  work  he  was
    doing.

15.  Thus the appeal was dismissed.  Grounds of  appeal  were  submitted  in
    somewhat complicated form.

16.  Complaint was made that the Judge was wrong to make such a  finding  as
    to the documents.  She contended that indeed her  husband  had  been  a
    qualified person as at the time.

17.  There was also concern expressed that the Judge in his  remarks  seemed
    to be treating the application as an out  of  country  ECO  application
    rather than one that was in-country.

18.  Permission to appeal was granted on 8th May 2014 on the basis that  the
    Judge erred in  saying  that  the  appellant  was  outside  the  United
    Kingdom, that that may have influenced the Judge in what documents  had
    been accepted in the appeal.

19.  Thus the matter came before me in pursuance of  that  grant  of  leave.
    There was a letter from  Jade  Law  Solicitors  dated  13th  June  2014
    confirming that the appellant  relied  on  the  witness  statement  and
    evidence submitted at the appeal.  Once again an indication  was  given
    that she and her representatives would not be in attendance  but  would
    be content for the matter to be dealt with on the papers.

20.  The same undated  statement  to  which  reference  has  been  made  was
    attached  to  that  letter  together  with   the   national   insurance
    contribution letter to which reference has already been made.  There is
    marked upon the national insurance contributions a Post Office  receipt
    issued on 16th June 2013 for �50 via the  Santander  pay  service.   To
    what  extent that it is relevant to the payment of the contributions is
    far from clear.

21.  In essence, therefore, the documents that are relied  upon  were  those
    which were before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  No attempt would seem
    to have been made to clarify the issues.

22.   The  real  difficulty  with  self-assessment  is  that  there  is   no
    objectivity in the assessment as to what is being earned and how.   The
    self-assessment forms for example are not submitted nor  is  there  the
    slightest indication as to what the ex-husband did by way of occupation
    or employment.  Accepting as I do there are sometimes  difficulties  in
    obtaining  documentation  following  divorce  it  is  clear  that   the
    appellant lived with him for a number of years and presumably therefore
    would be able to say what he did and to obtain some evidence from those
    for who he worked as to the work that was undertaken.   The  fact  that
    this is the second opportunity which the appellant has had  to  produce
    documents or information concerning the employment or occupation of her
    ex-husband and that is not forthcoming.

23.  In the statement  she  refers  to  him  returning  seemingly  to  Spain
    although Portuguese but gives no detail as to when that was relative to
    her divorce.

24.  The grounds  of  appeal  and  indeed  the  skeleton  argument  that  is
    advanced in support is somewhat complicated in its terms.  In  fact  it
    seems to contain the contention  that  the  application  for  permanent
    residence was not dependent on the husband.  There was some  suggestion
    that the requirement that the ex-husband  had  been  exercising  treaty
    rights at the time of divorce was not a requirement under law.

25.  Insofar as that is contended I reject  it  in  the  light  of  HS  (EEA
    Revocation of Obtained Rights) (Syria) [2011]  UKUT  165  (IAC).   Such
    makes it clear that Regulation 10 of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
    2006 requires the appellant to demonstrate that a genuine marriage that
    has lasted three years the couple have spent one year together  in  the
    United Kingdom and that the EEA national spouse was  exercising  treaty
    rights at the time he ceased to be a family member.

26.  Given the paucity of the documentation that  has  been  produced,  even
    applying the balance of  probabilities,  I  find  that  the  Judge  was
    entitled to come to the conclusion which was  arrived  at  namely  that
    there was insufficient evidence  that  the  ex-husband  was  exercising
    treaty rights at the date of divorce.  In those circumstances I  uphold
    the decision by the Judge that the relevant Regulation is not met.

27.  The grounds also touch upon the fact that the Judge seems not  to  have
    considered Article 8.  Once again the paucity of information  contained
    in the appellant's statement and  lack  of  particulars  as  to  family
    members if any in the United Kingdom or interests or involvement  other
    than working.  Such does not in my view provide  a  satisfactory  basis
    upon which to invoke Article 8 of the ECHR.  Indeed the argument as  to
    Article 8 set out in the skeleton argument  is  brief  in  the  extreme
    indicating that the appellant has been with her current employer  since
    2010 and has completed a number of work related courses and  has  built
    up links in her community and friends at work.

28.  Once again if it had been  seriously  contended  that  the  appellant's
    human rights would be breached  upon  removal  there  could  have  been
    further details about her private and or family life.

29.  Overall therefore I find that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  was  one  that  was  properly  open  to  be  made.    In   those
    circumstances the original decision will stand, namely that the  appeal
    under the Regulations is dismissed.
