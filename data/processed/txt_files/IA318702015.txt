                            DECISION AND REASONS






BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL
 1.  The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka. He first entered  the  United
    Kingdom on 6 September 2010, as a student. His leave  was  subsequently
    extended in the same capacity until 5 March 2015,  but  his  leave  was
    curtailed on 29 May 2013. He was then refused  leave  to  remain  as  a
    student on 14 May 2014.

2.   On 27 February 2015 the Appellant applied for a residence card  as  his
    EEA national cousin's extended  family  member.   His  application  was
    refused on 31 July 2015 and he appealed against this decision.  He  was
    granted an extension of time to appeal on 7 December  2015  as  he  had
    previously appealed out of time.  His appeal was initially listed to be
    heard on 9 February 2017 but his appeal was stayed after  the  decision
    in Sala (EFMs: Right  of  Appeal)  [2016]  UKUT  00411  (IAC)  and  was
    relisted after the Court of Appeal's decision in Khan  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

3.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal
    in a decision promulgated on  17  July  2019.  The  Appellant  appealed
    against this decision and First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan granted  him
    permission to appeal on 19 September 2019.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING
4.   Counsel for the Appellant and the Home Office Presenting  Officer  both
    made oral submissions and I have taken these into account when reaching
    my findings below.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION
5.   Regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations states:

     "8(1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a person  who
    is not a family member of an EEA national under regulation 7(1)(a), (b)
    or ( c) and who satisfies the conditions in paragraph (2), (3)  (4)  or
    (5).

     (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph  if  the  person
    is the relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his civil partner and-



     (a) the person is residing in an EEA State in which  the  EEA  national
    also resides and is dependent upon the EEA national or is a  member  of
    his household;
      (b)  the  person  satisfied  the  condition  in  paragraph   (a),   is
    accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom or wishes  to  join
    him there; or
     (c) the person satisfied the condition in  paragraph  (a),  has  joined
    that EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to  be  dependent
    upon him or to be a member of his household".

6.    The  Appellant's  application  was  refused  on  the  basis  that  the
    Respondent did not accept that the Appellant was related to his sponsor
    as claimed or that his sponsor was exercising a  Treaty  right  in  the
    United Kingdom. She also stated that the Appellant had not provided any
    evidence of his dependency on his sponsor  prior  to  arriving  in  the
    United Kingdom.

7.   In paragraph 20 of the decision First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hodgkinson
    accepted that the Appellant was related to his sponsor as  claimed.  In
    paragraph 22 he also found that the Appellant had established that  his
    sponsor had been exercising a Treaty right in the United Kingdom at the
    time when the Appellant claimed to be dependent upon him.  It  was  not
    disputed that the Appellant's sponsor has been  living  in  the  United
    Kingdom since 2009.

8.   Therefore, the sole  issue  between  the  parties,  as  raised  by  the
    Respondent, was whether the  Appellant  had  been  dependent  upon  his
    sponsor.

9.   It was the Appellant's case that his father had died in 2003  and  then
    his cousin's family had provided him and his  mother  and  sister  with
    somewhere to live and financial support. But he added that  from  2009,
    when  his  sponsor  came  to  the  United  Kingdom,  he  had  had  sole
    responsibility for the Appellant's support; initially in Sri Lanka  and
    then here.

10.  At the hearing the Appellant provided the original  of  his  pass  book
    for his personal account with Commercial Bank when he was still  living
    in Sri Lanka between 2009 and 2010 and in paragraph 42 of his  decision
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson noted that the deposits  shown  in
    the Appellant's passbook, as cash  deposits,  were  identical  to  sums
    recorded on the Mocha Net Limited money transfer receipts for the  same
    period.  The Mocha Net Limited receipts also confirmed that the sponsor
    was the payee and the Appellant was the recipient. In paragraph  43  of
    his decision First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson  noted  that  in  the
    Mocha receipts the section  entitled  "Receiver  Account  Details"  was
    marked N/A. However, the receiver's phone number was recorded  and  the
    fact that this was the Appellant's number has not  been  challenged  by
    the Respondent. In addition, N/A means "not applicable"  and  the  fact
    that the Appellant did not have a "receiver account" does not mean that
    the money was not transferred to him.

11.  In paragraph 43 of his decision the Judge also  placed  weight  on  the
    fact that in the Sponsor's letter, dated 26 February 2015, he  referred
    to his sponsor making deposits into  the  Appellant's  account.  It  is
    correct that the sponsor had said that the "following deposits were  in
    Commercial bank account were made by myself while he was in Sri Lanka".
     However, the meaning of that assertion is arguably  open  to  question
    and it could mean that the following deposits  made  by  the  Appellant
    were facilitated by the money  transferred  to  the  Appellant  by  the
    sponsor, as was evidenced by  the  Pass  Book  and  Mocha  Net  Limited
    Receipts.  In his witness statement, the Sponsor did refer to his other
    family members providing the Appellant and his mother and  sister  with
    accommodation and support for the Appellant and  his  sister's  studies
    when they were young.

12.  However, the key question was whether the  financial  support  sent  by
    the sponsor to the Appellant was to provide for his basic needs. In his
    oral evidence the Appellant said that since 2009 his sponsor  had  paid
    his tuition fees and all of his expenses. The Judge did not ask himself
    this question, despite referring to Siew Lian  Lim  v  Entry  Clearance
    Officer [2015] EWCA Civ 1383.

13.  In relation to the support provided by  the  sponsor  since  2014,  the
    Sponsor's Lloyds Bank  statements  confirmed  that  he  had  set  up  a
    standing order to pay the Appellant ï¿½100 per week;  the  first  payment
    having been made on 30 October 2014 and the order still being in  place
    on 30 May 2019. As the Appellant is clearly shown as the payee, I  find
    that little weight  should  have  been  given  to  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant had not also  provided  bank  statements  for  his  own  bank
    account.

14.  On the evidence before the Judge his  conclusion  that  these  payments
    were not solely for the Appellant's use and that the Sponsor could  not
    have afforded to pay him these amounts  was  pure  speculation  without
    further evidence to back up his assertions. It may  well  be  that  the
    Sponsor and the Appellant could have clarified the Sponsor's  financial
    circumstances but they were never asked to do so.

15.  In paragraph 54 of his decision First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hodgkinson
    indicated that certain of the available evidence was contrived  and  in
    paragraph 55 he found that" the Respondent had  discharged  the  burden
    upon him in establishing  that  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  have
    practiced some deception in seeking to  argue  the  claim  dependency".
    These were  serious  allegations  which  did  not  correlate  with  the
    positive findings of fact which the Judge had made in paragraphs 42 and
    48 of his decision.

16.  When granting permission to appeal, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chohan
    found that "it does seem that the judge concluded  that  the  appellant
    had exercised  deception  in  establishing  the  claim  of  dependency,
    whereas the respondent had not raised such an issue".  I find that  the
    refusal letter had not asserted that the Appellant and the sponsor  had
    attempted to deceive the Respondent and  this  was  not  an  allegation
    which was put to them at the appeal hearing. I do  not  find  that  the
    Judge's remark at paragraph 50 of his decision that the weekly standard
    order "presented as a contrived dependency, as intimated by  [the  Home
    Office Presenting  Officer]  in  his  submissions"  was  sufficient  to
    establish that this allegation had been clearly put.

17.  For all of these reasons I find that there were material errors of  law
    in First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson's decision.

DECISION
(1)  The Appellant's appeal is granted.
(2)  First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodkingson's decision is set aside.
(3)  The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  de  novo  re-
    hearing before  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judges Hodgkinson and Chohan.
