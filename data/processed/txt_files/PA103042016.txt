Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr U Aslam, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision dated 9 September  2016,  giving  reasons
         for refusing the appellant's claim.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, filed
         on 26 September 2016.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge Porter, promulgated on 27 July 2017.

     iv) The  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal made  to  the  FtT,  dated  10
         August 2017.

      v) The refusal of permission by FtT Judge  Pooler,  dated  20  October
         2017.

     vi) The grounds of appeal stated in the application for  permission  to
         appeal made to the UT,  received  on  21  November  2017  (adopting
         previous grounds and disputing the refusal of permission).

    vii) The grant of permission by UTJ Gleeson, dated 22 January 2018.

 2. The complaint in ground 1 is that  the  appellant  was  denied  a  fair
    hearing, because the judge failed to ask his  supporting  witness  from
    the Tron Church whether a married businessman was likely to  experience
    an epiphany leading to his conversion.

 3. Having considered the submissions  on  this  point,  no  unfairness  of
    procedure is shown.  It was clear from the evidence of the witness that
    he thought it possible for someone like the appellant to convert.   The
    judge understood that.  Fairness did not require her to ask the witness
    for further comment.

 4. Further, it appears highly unlikely that the witness had anything  more
    specific and useful to say if he had been asked.  The ground  does  not
    suggest that he did.

 5. As developed in submissions by Mr Aslam, the challenge to paragraph  31
    of the decision was not denial of a fair hearing.  Rather, it  was  the
    reaching of a finding purportedly  based  on  general  plausibility  or
    credibility, which the judge muddled together,  but  in  reality  based
    only on the judge's  opinion  and  conjecture,  with  no  reasoning  to
    underpin it.

 6. Mrs O'Brien submitted that the judge's findings were not generalised or
    unreasoned, but arose from the appellant's own account.

 7. Ground 1, as developed in submissions,  does  not  show  error  through
    conjecture.  The judge did not think it impossible for anyone to make a
    surprising life-changing decision, or for anyone to have the  luck  not
    to be present at the time of a raid by  the  authorities  in  which  he
    might have been caught up (ground 2).  She was  simply  not  persuaded,
    having had the advantage of  hearing  the  appellant  giving  his  oral
    evidence, that his account was even reasonably likely to be true.   The
    outcome, and  the  several  features  on  which  she  founds,  are  not
    speculative, but within the scope of reason.

 8. Ground 3 (as originally presented) is based on the judge  having  found
    it inconsistent that the appellant had not proceeded  significantly  in
    his development as a Christian, and so having apparently concluded that
    he was "a liar, but not a very good one",  without  explaining  why  he
    might not  simply  having  been  having  genuine  difficulty  with  the
    conversion process; and  thus,  a  relevant  matter  was  left  out  of
    account.

 9. In the grounds as renewed, the appellant  added  that  on  "any  proper
    reading" the judge concluded that the appellant was  not  credible  and
    then that "evidence from Tron church officials did  not  displace  that
    conclusion".  Reference was made to Mibanga v SSHD  (without  supplying
    the citation, which is in the grant of permission: [2005] EWCA Civ 367,
    [2005] INLR 377).

10. It is not  shown  that  the  judge  did  overlook  the  possibility  of
    difficulty or delay in an ongoing genuine process of  conversion.   She
    was simply not persuaded that this was a genuine process of  conversion
    at all.  This part of the grounds looks for a distinction which is  not
    there, and is only another way  of  probing  for  disagreement  on  the
    facts.

11. There was no error of making a negative assessment, then seeing whether
    other material displaced it.  Judges must set out their points in  some
    order.  The judge said at �30, before any of her findings, that she had
    considered all the evidence.  She said at �33, after all her  findings,
    that her conclusion was "on the basis of all the above  factors".   The
    appellant has not pointed to  anything  in  the  decision  whereby  she
    should not be taken at her word.

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
