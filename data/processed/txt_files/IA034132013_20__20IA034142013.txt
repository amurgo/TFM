                                                                  Respondent


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL



1.     These were appeals by the appellants to the original  appeal  against
    the decision dated 19 April 2013 of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Hawden-
    Beal to refuse leave to remain as a Tier 4 General  Migrant  (or  as  a
    dependent of such) or on Article 8 grounds.

 2. In line with Rule 17 (1) (a) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, the appellants have applied in writing  to  withdraw  their
    appeals. It is not necessary for the Tribunal to  formally  consent  as
    the matter is still at the permission stage.

 3.  The  appellants  withdraw  their  appeals.  There  is   therefore   no
    application for permission to appeal before the Upper Tribunal and  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Hawden-Beal stands.


Signed:                                 Dated: 11 June 2013
Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt
