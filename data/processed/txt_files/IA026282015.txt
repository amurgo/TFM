For the Respondent:    Mr J Butterworth, Counsel, instructed by S&S
Immigration Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent in this appeal, who I shall refer to as the Claimant, is
    a national of India who came to the United Kingdom in April  2014.   He
    then applied for a residence card as an extended family member  of  his
    sister-in-law who is an EEA national exercising treaty  rights  in  the
    United Kingdom.  His application was refused on 2 January 2015  because
    the Respondent did not accept that the Claimant met  the  criteria  set
    out in  Regulation  8  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.

 2. The Claimant appealed against that decision and his appeal came  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Phelan on 27 July 2015.  In a decision
    dated 12 August 2015 the First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed  the  appeal
    having heard evidence from the Claimant,  his  sister-in-law,  and  his
    brother, and having considered the evidence before her, which  included
    eight MoneyGram or Forex receipts dated from 2010 until 2014, attesting
    to the remittance of money by Claimant's sister-in-law and  brother  to
    him in the  United  States  between  2010  and  2014.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge expressly found that the  Claimant  had  been  dependent
    upon his sister-in-law while he was living in the US at [26] and whilst
    this had not been continuous  dependence  he  was  dependent  when  his
    income was insufficient during that four year period, and on that basis
    at [26] the First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted  the  Claimant  met  the
    criteria set out at Regulation 8(2)(a) and (c) of the Immigration (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.

 3. The Secretary  of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  against  this
    decision on 18 August 2015.  The grounds of appeal  asserted  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  made  a  material  misdirection  in  law  in
    finding that the Claimant satisfied the requirements  under  Regulation
    8(2).  Reference was made to the decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Dauhoo [2012] UKUT 79 and it was asserted that the Claimant was  unable
    to meet any of the four categories of case set out therein  as  he  had
    never been dependent on the EEA national prior to coming to the  United
    Kingdom.  It was asserted that rather the Claimant had  been  supported
    by his parents, who had also resided with him in India and  essentially
    the remittances from the Claimant's sister-in-law just  topped  up  his
    income as and when it was needed.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer on
    10 December 2015.  In granting permission the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    simply set out the grounds of appeal and stated that  it  was  arguable
    that the judge had misdirected herself for the  above  reason  and  the
    grounds submitted by the respondent are arguable.

    Hearing

 5. At the hearing before me Mr Tufan, on behalf of the Secretary of State,
    submitted that the issue was simply whether or  not  the  Claimant  had
    been dependent on his Sponsor, the EEA national, during the  time  that
    he was living in the United States and whether the Claimant relied upon
    the Sponsor  for  his  basic  or  essential  needs.  He  accepted  that
    dependency had been established by the Claimant upon  his  Sponsor  EEA
    national since his arrival in the United Kingdom.

 6.  Mr  Butterworth  on  behalf  of  the  Claimant  made   very   detailed
    submissions.  He referred me to Moneke at [41] and also to the decision
    in Flora May Reyas v Migrationsverket Case C-423/2012ECJ.  He submitted
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had correctly  directed  herself  in
    respect of the relevant case law at [21] and [22] of her  decision  and
    indeed the Judge there does refer not only to Reyas  but  also  to  Jia
    Case C1/05, the judgment of the Court of Appeal in  Bigia  [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 79 as well as the decision in Moneke (EEA -  OFMs)  Nigeria  [2011]
    UKUT 00341 (IAC) where the Tribunal expressly considered the  issue  of
    dependency in this context and confirmed that the test of dependency is
    whether the person needs financial support from the EEA national or his
    spouse in order to meet his essential needs.

 7. Crucially at  [41]  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  referred  to  the
    decision known as Moneke  (1)  which  in  turn  referred  both  to  the
    decisions of the Court of Appeal in SM (India) and the Court of Justice
    in Lebon [1987]  ECR  2811,  and  also  made  reference  to  the  entry
    clearance instructions in force at that time,  at  chapter  5.12  which
    stated inter alia: "provided a person would not be able to meet his  or
    her essential living needs without the financial  support  of  the  EEA
    national she/he should not be considered dependent on  that  national".
    In those circumstances it does not matter  that  the  Claimant  may  in
    addition receive financial support income from other sources.

 8. The factual basis of this application is that the Claimant  had  worked
    whilst in the US. He found employment at a cell phone agency  repairing
    phones in respect of which he was paid $9 an hour but  his  hours  were
    not constant. Sometimes he only had six or nine hours a week, sometimes
    no hours at all, and therefore he only managed to meet  this  essential
    living needs with the financial assistance of his brother and sister-in-
    law.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal Judge noted this  evidence  and  she  expressly
    found at [23] correctly in my view that:

         "Dependency is a question of fact. I would consider essential needs
         to include food, clothing and accommodation.  I would not  consider
         gym membership, computers  or  an  expensive  mobile  phone  to  be
         essential needs. For the appellant to show that he continues to  be
         dependent he must show that he was dependent before coming  to  the
         UK, and that the support is continuing."

10. And at [25] she found

         "On the evidence about ï¿½1200 was  sent  to  the  appellant  yearly,
         sometimes more, sometimes  less.  Even  reducing  this  by  50%  to
         exclude Mr Powar's contribution, it is a  significant  amount.  The
         frequency of remittances varied according to the appellant's needs,
         which suggests to me  that  the  appellant  was  dependent  on  his
         brother and sister-in-law at the times when he could not  meet  his
         essential living needs. This included material help paying his rent
         when his hours of work were not enough to pay his rent and bills."

    And as a consequence the judge  went  on  to  find  at  [26]  that  the
    requirements of Regulation 8(2)(a) and (c) had been met.

11. In light of [51] of Moneke I find that  whilst  the  Claimant  was  not
    continuously and solely dependent upon his EEA  national  sister-in-law
    and brother immediately prior to his entrance to the United Kingdom, he
    was, as First-tier Tribunal Judge Phelan found, dependent upon them for
    his essential living needs between 2010 and 2014 to the extent that  he
    would not have been able to manage without the money that they remitted
    to him.



Notice of Decision

12. For those reasons I find that there is no material error of law in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge which I uphold. The appeal by
    the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  is   accordingly
    dismissed.

13.  No anonymity direction is made.
