                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M Davies, promulgated on 11th May 2018, following  a  hearing  in
    Manchester on 1st May 2018.  In the determination, the judge  dismissed
    the appeal of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the  Appellant  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.





The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, was born on 1st  January  1972,
    and is a female.  She appealed against the decision of  the  Respondent
    dated 9th November 2017, refusing her application for leave  to  remain
    in the UK on the basis of her genuine and subsisting relationship  with
    her British citizen partner.  The  applicable  Immigration  Rules  were
    EX.1(a) of Appendix FM.

The Appellant's Case

 3. The Appellant's case was based upon written and oral testimony, of  the
    Appellant, her partner, and her partner's daughter and the  Appellant's
    daughter (see paragraph 18).  The judge made it clear that he took into
    account all of the oral testimony at the hearing.  The  Appellant  gave
    evidence in her own language (paragraph 23).  She  explained  that  her
    partner and her children were at risk due to threats from her  in-laws,
    namely the family of her deceased husband.  She said  that  they  could
    potentially kill them as it could easily be done in Pakistan (paragraph
    25).  She said that her deceased husband's family would not accept  her
    relationship with her partner because they were uneducated,  illiterate
    and backward in their thinking and once a person was married they  were
    married for life (paragraph 26).  She had said that her present partner
    and she met a month or two after arriving in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    that her first husband was alive at the time (paragraph 27).

 4. In cross-examination it  was  pointed  out  that  she  still  had  four
    children in Pakistan, and she accepted this was true.  There had been a
    previous Tribunal decision by Judge Heynes which she  did  not  attend.
    She gave evidence that initially she had messages from her husband when
    he was alive and after his death from his brothers who  had  threatened
    her and verbally abused her over the  telephone  (paragraph  30).   She
    could not now return because she had a daughter and she would be  found
    out and killed.  She was in contact with her four children in Pakistan.
     When the Presenting Officer  asked  the  Appellant  why  her  deceased
    husband's relatives would have a problem with her marriage  given  that
    she now claimed to be a widow and had gone through an Islamic  marriage
    in the United Kingdom in 2013, the Appellant's reply was that they were
    backward in their thinking (paragraph 34).

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge observed how the Appellant had initially been  refused  leave
    to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor and  had  then  appealed  that
    decision.  As a result of that appeal she  succeeded  and  subsequently
    entered the UK  as  a  visitor  with  her  daughter.   The  Appellant's
    behaviour after her arrival  as  a  visitor,  and  the  fact  that  she
    remained without leave "clearly indicates to me that when she initially
    made an application to come to the United Kingdom as a visitor she  was
    seeking to deceive  the  Respondent"  (paragraph  65).   The  Appellant
    "never was a genuine visitor to the United Kingdom and always  intended
    to come here for other reasons" (paragraph 65).

 6. Second, Judge Heynes had first decided this matter and had come to  the
    view that her entry to the UK on 14th July 2010 with her daughter  "was
    a  pre-planned  enterprise".   The  judge  now  observed  that  it  was
    reasonably likely that

         "The purpose of her entering the United Kingdom was to come to care
         for the children of her present partner,  [AA].   I  come  to  that
         conclusion because it is not simply a coincidence that the  two  of
         [AA]'s children arrived in the United Kingdom on the same date,  on
         the same flight, at the same airport, and at the same  terminal  as
         the Appellant and her daughter" (paragraph 66).

 7. The judge went on to conclude that the Appellant and  her  partner  had
    been involved in deception (paragraph 67).  The evidence that they  had
    given "is patently untrue" (paragraph 69).  The judge also was  of  the
    view that the Appellant's first husband was not dead and that,

         "I believe he remained in  Pakistan  when  the  Appellant  and  her
         daughter came to the United Kingdom to look after the four children
         that the  Appellant  claims  to  have  abandoned  in  Pakistan.   I
         therefore conclude that it is reasonably likely as at  the  hearing
         before me, taking into  account  the  untruthful  evidence  I  have
         received, that the Appellant's husband is not deceased as  claimed"
         (paragraph 69).

 8. It did not end there, the judge went on to also take note of  the  fact
    that "the reason why the Appellant and her claimed partner  have  never
    gone through a lawful marriage in the United Kingdom and had only  gone
    through an Islamic marriage is because the Appellant  is  not  free  to
    marry as her first husband is still alive" (paragraph 70.

 9.  Accordingly,  the  judge's  view  was  that  "there  is  no  substance
    whatsoever in the claim made by the Appellant and [AA] that  they  have
    received  threats  from  the  Appellant's   first   husband's   family"
    (paragraph 71).  That aside, "there are  no  significant  obstacles  in
    relation to paragraph 276ADE to the Appellant returning to Pakistan and
    integrating into life there" (paragraph 72).

10. The appeal was dismissed with the observation  that,  "it  is  entirely
    incredible if threats had been made to the Appellant and [AA] from 2013
    that they would be raised for the first time at the hearing before  me"
    (paragraph 74).

Grounds of Application

11. The grounds of application state that  the  judge  was  wrong  to  have
    concluded that the Appellant and her partner were not in a genuine  and
    subsisting relationship because, in  the  event,  she  was  simply  his
    housekeeper.

12. On 16th August 2018 permission to appeal was granted.

13. On 1st October 2018, a Rule 24 response was entered to the effect  that
    the judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that the  Sponsor  and
    the Appellant were not in a genuine and subsisting relationship.   This
    was given the previous findings of Judge  Heynes  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant.  Judge Davies had  now,  after  hearing  evidence  from  the
    Appellant and her witnesses, come to the same conclusion, and the  fact
    that some of the witnesses were not cross-examined  was  not  material,
    because both the Appellant and the Sponsor were questioned.





Submissions

14. At the hearing before me on 31st October 2018, Mr Timson, appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, relied upon the grounds  of  application.   He
    submitted that the following fundamental issues arose.

15. In addition to the Appellant and her sponsoring husband, there were two
    other witnesses.  These were the children who gave evidence.  They were
    Shafiq [A] (see pages 7 to 8 of the Appellant's bundle); and Faiza  [A]
    (see pages 308 to 309 of the Appellant's bundle).  They  gave  evidence
    about the nature of the relationship between their parents.  The  judge
    does not even refer to their evidence.  He does  not  deal  with  this.
    All that one can get a glimpse of in relation to these  two  witnesses,
    appears at paragraph 18, where the judge states  that,  "I  have  taken
    into account the written and  oral  testimony  of  the  Appellant,  her
    partner,  her  partner's  daughter  and   the   Appellant's   daughter"
    (paragraph 18).  The witnesses were not  cross-examined.   Yet,  Shafiq
    [A] was the daughter of the Appellant's husband (see paragraph 6 of her
    statement at page 8 of the Appellant's bundle) and this makes it  clear
    that they live together as a family  unit.   The  Appellant's  youngest
    son, who is a minor, is  not  even  mentioned  in  terms  of  his  best
    interests.  There is no finding in this regard.

16. The biological daughter  of  the  Appellant  also  gave  evidence,  and
    attached to her witness statement (at page 310A) is an  adoption  order
    from the UK Family Court, and the judge draws no attention to this.  If
    the Appellant's own daughter had been  adopted,  through  Family  Court
    proceedings by her sponsoring husband in the  UK,  this  plainly  meant
    that the child would be able to  remain  in  this  country,  while  her
    mother, the Appellant, faced removal, and that would split  the  family
    up.  The judge had no basis at all to come to the view that,

         "I cannot be satisfied that  there  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship between the Appellant and her  partner's  child,  [F].
         It seems more likely looking at the  evidence  that  the  Appellant
         simply acts as a housekeeper  for  her  claimed  partner  and  [F].
         Whilst they may have gone  through  an  Islamic  marriage  ceremony
         taking into account their lack of credibility, I do not accept that
         there is a genuine and subsisting  relationship  akin  to  marriage
         between the Appellant and [AA]" (paragraph 75).

17. Finally, although the judge goes on to consider  the  adoption  of  the
    Appellant's daughter, his rejection of it is  simply  incomprehensible.
    He observes that, "when reaching that conclusion I  take  into  account
    the adoption of the Appellant's daughter by  [AA]  but  that  does  not
    satisfy me that because of that  there  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship between the Appellant and Mr  [AA]"  (paragraph  76).   Mr
    Timson enquired rhetorically as to why the judge felt it  necessary  to
    say that he could not be satisfied.  If there was  an  adoption  order,
    plainly that went a long way to satisfying him.  In short, without  the
    judge taking into  account  the  evidence  of  the  two  children,  and
    evaluating it properly, it was simply not possible to say  what  impact
    that evidence would have had on the position of the Appellant  and  her
    sponsoring husband [AA].  It was fundamental  in  terms  of  procedural
    fairness, that the evidence of the witnesses should  be  described  and
    properly evaluated in the body of the determination.

18. For his part, Mr Bates submitted that the Secretary of State was  aware
    of the intention to adopt as long ago as at the  time  of  the  refusal
    letter (see paragraph 14 of the  refusal  letter).   This  was  not  an
    unknown matter.  Of course, by the time of the  hearing,  the  adoption
    had already taken effect.  However, the adopted child was now an adult.
     If she remained in this country as an adult, that did not prevent  the
    Appellant from returning back to Pakistan to make  another  application
    in a lawful manner.

19. Second, Mr Bates explained how there had been  two  previous  hearings.
    Judge Heynes had  found  the  evidence  to  have  been  unreliable  and
    evasive.  The questions asked were  not  answered.   They  were  simply
    avoided (paragraph 43).

20. Third, the judge had earlier noted that there  had  been  an  elaborate
    design in which the Appellant's application as  a  visitor,  which  had
    initially been refused, but then allowed on appeal, was always intended
    to be one where she was going to deceive the authorities and not return
    back to Pakistan.  She had succeeded in the deception that was  carried
    out (paragraph 65).  The judge had observed that the Appellant  arrived
    as a claimed visitor with a  daughter  as  "a  pre-planned  enterprise"
    (paragraph 66).  It was a remarkable coincidence  that  two  of  [AA]'s
    children arrived in the UK on the same date, on the same flight, at the
    same airport, and at  the  same  terminal  as  the  Appellant  and  her
    daughter (paragraph 66).

21. Finally, the judge had, in the interests of clarity and a comprehensive
    approach, ended by saying that if he was wrong in his findings, he  did
    not  accept  that  the  Appellant's  removal  to  Pakistan  would  have
    consequences of such gravity as to potentially engage the operation  of
    Article 8.  The Appellant, if she is genuinely in a  relationship  with
    [AA], can  return  to  Pakistan  and  make  an  application  for  entry
    clearance as a fianc�e (paragraph 78).

22. In the end, the very basis of the relationship was questionable because
    the judge had grave doubts about the Appellant's  husband  in  Pakistan
    being dead and rejected this contention  entirely.   Judge  Heynes  had
    also found that her first husband  was  not  dead.   Judge  Davies  now
    concluded that he remained in  Pakistan  when  the  Appellant  and  her
    daughter came to the UK.  If this was the case, then it  explained  why
    there had only been an Islamic marriage between the  Appellant  and  Mr
    [AA] because the fact was "the Appellant is not free to  marry  as  her
    first husband is still alive" (paragraph 70).

23. In reply Mr Timson submitted that the statement at paragraph 78 that it
    was open to the Appellant to return back to Pakistan and apply again as
    a fianc�e, was a  standard  statement  that  appeared  in  all  refusal
    letters and it did not add very much at all to the specific  nature  of
    this application.  If it was the  case  that  two  of  [AA]'s  children
    arrived in the UK on the same date, on the same  flight,  at  the  same
    airport, and at the same terminal, this only shows the  genuineness  of
    the commitment between the parties,  and  their  intention  to  have  a
    family life in the way that they subsequently have precisely done.   It
    should not be taken against them.  The  adoption  order  was  of  great
    significance but  the  judge  discounts  it  as  not  pointing  to  the
    genuineness of the relationship between the Appellant and the  Sponsor.
    The fact that two of the witnesses who  gave  evidence,  are  not  even
    referred to in their evidence, was a serious error of law.

24. He asked me to allow the appeal.

No Error of Law

25. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision  and  re-make  the
    decision.  I  come  to  this  conclusion  notwithstanding  Mr  Timson's
    measured and impressive efforts to persuade me otherwise.   My  reasons
    are as follows.

26. First, it is not the case that the judge is oblivious of  the  evidence
    given by the two children, namely, Shafiq  [A],  and  Faiza  [A].   The
    judge expressly refers to this evidence  (at  paragraph  18)  and  even
    makes it clear that, "I have taken into account  their  oral  testimony
    given at the hearing".

27. Second, the centrality of that evidence is what really matters,  and  I
    have to say, that the judge did  not  consider  their  evidence  to  be
    central to the main issue, namely, whether the Appellant and [AA], were
    in a genuine and subsisting relationship, living together  as  man  and
    wife, as they contended the case to be.  It would have been  altogether
    otherwise if the judge had not given their evidence the  due  attention
    and care that it required.  On the  contrary,  however,  the  judge  in
    particular detail addresses their evidence (at paragraph 23)  referring
    to first the evidence of [FA], and then setting  out  both  the  cross-
    examination (at paragraph 28), and then the re-examination by Mr Timson
    (at paragraph 35).  He then goes on to consider the evidence of Mr [AA]
    in the same manner.  He was entitled to come  to  the  conclusion  that
    their evidence was tainted with deception, and was  "patently  untrue",
    for the  reasons  that  the  judge  gave,  namely,  that  there  was  a
    deliberate desire at the outset to defraud the immigration  authorities
    in this country, for the Appellant to use  the  route  of  a  visitor's
    application,  as  a  ruse,  to  enter  this  country  and  remain  here
    indefinitely (see paragraph 65).  There had, after all, been a previous
    decision by Judge Heynes, which the present judge  took  into  account.
    In addition, the present  judge,  Mr  Davies,  himself  looked  at  the
    specific facts in relation to the case, pointing  out  how  two  of  Mr
    [AA]'s children arrived on the same date, on the same  flight,  at  the
    same airport, and at  the  same  terminal  as  the  Appellant  and  her
    daughter (paragraph 66).

28. Third, there is the issue of the adoption of the  Appellant's  daughter
    by [AA].  It is important to be clear as to what this  is  intended  to
    do.  It demonstrates that as a matter of law, the daughter is  now  the
    adopted child of [AA].  It does not, however,  necessarily  demonstrate
    that there  is  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and  [AA]  themselves.   Put  another  way,  it  is  entirely
    possible for that relationship to have either been not in existence  in
    the first place, or to have broken down irretrievably  thereafter,  for
    the adoption still to be  a  perfectly  valid  legal  exercise.   This,
    indeed, is exactly the terms  in  which  Judge  Davies  addresses  this
    question, pointing out that, "I take into account the adoption  of  the
    Appellant's daughter by [AA], but that does not satisfy me that because
    of that there is a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and Mr [AA]" (paragraph 76).

29. Finally, I note Mr Timson's perfectly potent submission before me  that
    all of the children now have indefinite leave to remain, and  one  even
    is a British citizen.  However, the Appellant's daughter, the  one  who
    is adopted by Mr [AA], is now an adult, and the fact that the Appellant
    may be required, in these circumstances, to return  back  to  Pakistan,
    and to make an application to enter the UK,  as  a  fianc�e  (as  Judge
    Davies suggests at paragraph 78), is one that is not unreasonable,  and
    does not violate her Article 8 rights to family life.

30. In the end, one has to take the position  as  it  stands  in  the  real
    world.  If the Appellant  is  required  to  leave,  then  that  is  the
    starting point of the way in which proportionality  must  be  assessed.
    This is to say nothing of the fact, that the judge's findings were that
    the Appellant's first husband in Pakistan was still alive, as held also
    by Judge Heynes at the earlier decision, and if this is  so,  then  the
    Appellant is not free to marry Mr [AA] at all.  This would also explain
    why they have simply entered an Islamic  religious  marriage,  with  no
    civil ceremony planned.

31. All in all, therefore, the highly complex, and unusual arrangement that
    the judge found  himself  having  to  contend  with,  is  one  that  he
    addressed in a careful and experienced manner, such that  the  findings
    reached were those which were entirely open to him.  There is no  error
    of law.

Notice of Decision

32. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

33. An anonymity direction is made.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
