                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. At the hearing before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimmington  on  25th
      November 2013 she indicated that on initial view the appeal should  be
      remitted to the First Tier Tribunal because of the perception of  bias
      before the First-tier Tribunal judge who heard  the  appeal  at  first
      instance.


   2. By letter  dated  22nd  January  2014  the  respondent  accepted  this
      proposal and, no objection having been received by either party to the
      proposal in directions dated  13th  March  2014  that  the  appeal  be
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing de novo  I  set  aside
      the determination of the First-tier Tribunal on the grounds that there
      was a perception of bias such that the sponsor was impeded  in  giving
      evidence. In accordance with the  practice  Statement  25th  September
      2012 the appropriate course of action is for this appeal to  be  heard
      afresh by the First-tier Tribunal. No findings are preserved.


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision

     The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing.


                                    Date 27th March 2014
Judge of the Upper Tribunal Coker
