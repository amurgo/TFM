                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
   order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
   First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against
   a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson promulgated on  10  March
   2015 which allowed the Appellant's appeal under  Article  8  against  the
   decision of the Respondent to refuse her application for entry  clearance
   as a family visitor for 8 weeks
Background
3. The Appellant was born on 10 June 1979 and is a national of Bangladesh.
4. On 27 March 2014 the Appellant applied for entry clearance to  visit  her
   husband, the Sponsor Muhammad Ajmat Ullah and their son who both live  in
   the UK and are British citizens.
5. On 9 April 2014  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  the  Appellant's
   application. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons:
   a) There was no evidence of the  Appellants  financial  circumstances  in
      Bangladesh.
   b) The Appellant claimed to be financially reliant  on  her  sponsor  but
      there was no evidence of any property or assets in Bangladesh.
   c) The Appellant's spouse claimed he would pay for the visit but his bank
      account at the Halifax showed a balance of 41 pence  and  at  the  TSB
      �810.94 which would not be sufficient to maintain the Appellant for  8
      weeks.
   d) The refusal was therefore under paragraph 41 (i) (ii) (vi)  and  (vii)
      of the Rules.
   e) The letter set out that there was a limited right of appeal.


6. There was a review dated 26 August 2014 by the  Entry  Clearance  Manager
   after an appeal was lodged.
   (a)The ECM did not  accept  that  there  was  an  interference  with  the
   Appellant's right to family life.
   (b) He notes that the Sponsor and their child having lived  with  her  in
   Bangladesh made a choice to go and  live  in  the  UK  and  separate  the
   family.
   (c) There was no evidence that the Sponsor and his child could not  visit
   her in Bangladesh.
   (d) While it was asserted that the Sponsor's claim for Disability  Living
   Allowance would be resolved by June 2014 and  the  Appellant  could  then
   apply for settlement there was no evidence that such an  application  had
   been made.
   (e)The decision to  refuse  the  application  was  proportionate  to  the
   legitimate aim of immigration control.
The Judge's Decision
7. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Simpson ("the Judge") allowed the appeal against  the  Respondent's
   decision under Article 8. The Judge:
   a) She found that the Sponsor was 82 years  old  and  in  extremely  poor
      health.
   b) The sponsor was the primary carer for the couple's 11 year old child.
   c) She found in the light of  the  claim  for  DLA  by  the  sponsor  the
      Appellants claim for entry clearance  under  the  partner  and  parent
      route was likely to be successful as all matters  appeared  to  be  in
      place.
   d) The Appellant's child had not seen his mother for some years  and  was
      being cared for by an elderly parent.
   e) She found that the Appellant would not remain in the UK illegally  but
      would return to make a spouse application  and  therefore  refusal  of
      entry clearance in all the circumstances was disproportionate.
   f) The Judge found that in this  case  there  were  strong  compassionate
      circumstances why she would allow the appeal under Article 8.
8. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that the Judge had failed  to  give
   adequate reasons for finding that the decision was disproportionate;  she
   did not address section 117B of the Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum
   Act 2002; that on the evidence before her it was not open to the Judge to
   find that the Appellants settlement application would succeed given,  for
   example, there was no evidence as to her English language ability;  there
   was insufficient reasons given as to why  it  was  in  the  child's  best
   interests for her to come to the UK.
9. On 7 May  2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  gave  permission  to
   appeal.
Submissions

10. At the hearing I heard submissions from Ms Johnstone on  behalf  of  the
   Respondent that :

   a) There was no restriction on the grounds.

   b) There had to be an assessment of whether family life exists at all.

   c) She relied the cases of Adjei (visit visas - Article  8)  [2015]  UKUT
      0261 (IAC) and Kaur (visit appeals; Article 8) [2015] UKUT 487 (IAC)

   d) The caselaw was clear had to be an assessment of whether the Appellant
      would meet the requirements of the Rules as that was relevant  to  the
      assessment of proportionality. It was not  clear  that  the  Appellant
      would meet the language requirements or the financial requirements.

   e) There was no consideration of section 117B.

   f) If the intention was to make an  application  for  settlement  in  the
      proper way why had there been no application  by  9  April  2014.  The
      remedy was to make a settlement application.

11. On behalf of the Appellant Mr Timson submitted that:

   a) The grounds were limited in that the Judge had made clear that  family
      life existed and in granting  permission  Judge  Fisher  only  granted
      permission in relation to section 117B and proportionality.

   b) He submitted that the  failure  to  refer  to  section  117B  made  no
      material difference: the fact that she did or did  not  speak  English
      was irrelevant as she was a visitor and the Judge  specifically  dealt
      with the issue of return.

12. In reply Ms Johnstone on behalf of the Respondent submitted:

   a) There was no assessment of maintenance at the time of the decision

Legal Framework
13. In Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261 (IAC)  it  was  held
   that (i) The first question to be addressed in an appeal against  refusal
   to grant entry clearance as a visitor where only human rights grounds are
   available is whether article 8 of the ECHR is engaged at all.  If  it  is
   not, which will not  infrequently  be  the  case,  the  Tribunal  has  no
   jurisdiction to embark upon an assessment of  the  decision  of  the  ECO
   under the rules and should not do  so.  If  article  8  is  engaged,  the
   Tribunal may need to look at the extent to which the claimant is said  to
   have failed to meet the requirements of the rule because that may  inform
   the proportionality balancing exercise that must follow.
14. In Kaur (visit appeals; Article 8) [2015] UKUT 487 (IAC)  it was  stated
   that in visit appeals the Article 8 decision on an appeal cannot be  made
   in a vacuum.  Whilst judges only have jurisdiction to decide whether  the
   decision is unlawful under s.6 of the Human Rights  Act  1998  (or  shows
   unlawful discrimination) (see Mostafa  (Article  8  in  entry  clearance)
   [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC) and Adjei (visit visas - Article 8)  [2015]  UKUT
   0261 (IAC)), the starting-point for deciding that must be  the  state  of
   the evidence about the appellant's ability to meet  the  requirements  of
   paragraph 41 of the immigration rules.  The restriction in visitor  cases
   of grounds of appeal to human  rights  does  not  mean  that  judges  are
   relieved of their ordinary duties  of  fact-finding  or  that  they  must
   approach these in a qualitatively different way.  Where relevant  to  the
   Article 8 assessment, disputes as to the facts must be resolved by taking
   into account the evidence on both sides: see Adjei  at  [10]  bearing  in
   mind that the  burden  of  proof  rests  on  the  appellant.   Unless  an
   appellant can show that there are individual interests at  stake  covered
   by Article 8 "of a particularly pressing nature" so as to give rise to  a
   "strong claim that compelling circumstances  may  exist  to  justify  the
   grant of LTE [Leave to Enter] outside the rules": (see SS (Congo)  [2015]
   EWCA Civ 387 at [40] and [56]) he  or  she  is  exceedingly  unlikely  to
   succeed.  That proposition must also hold good in visitor appeals.
15. While the right of appeal is therefore in this  case  limited  to  human
   rights it is clear that the provisions of paragraph 41 of the  Rules  are
   to be considered and in this case those are:
16. The  requirements  of  Paragraph  41  that  are  put  in  issue  by  the
   Respondent are as follows:
"The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to  enter  the  United
Kingdom as a general visitor are that he:
(i) is genuinely seeking entry as a general visitor for a limited period  as
stated by him, not exceeding 6 months; and
(ii) intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of  the  period  of  the
visit as stated by him; and
(vi) will maintain and accommodate himself  and  any  dependants  adequately
out of resources available to  him  without  recourse  to  public  funds  or
taking  employment;  or  will,  with  any  dependants,  be  maintained   and
accommodated adequately by relatives or friends; and
(vii) can meet the cost of the return or onward journey;"
17. Section 117A (2) of the 2002 Act provides  that  where  a  Tribunal  is
    required to determine whether a decision  made  under  the  Immigration
    Acts would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998  it
    must, in considering 'the public interest question', have regard in all
    cases to the considerations listed in section117B of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as  amended  by  the  Immigration  Act
    2014). Section 117 (3) provides that  the  'public  interest  question'
    means the question of whether an interference with a person's right  to
    respect for private and family life is justified under Article 8(2).

Finding on Material Error

18. Having heard those  submissions,  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made material errors of law.

19. This was an appeal against a refusal of  entry  clearance  made  by  the
   Appellant on 27 March 2014 and refused in a notice dated 9 April 2014 and
   that decision was upheld by the ECO in a review dated 26 August 2014.

20. Section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 amended  s88A  of  the  2002
   Act so as to remove the right of appeal for  persons  visiting  specified
   family members. Although they are still able to bring an  appeal  on  the
   residual grounds in s 84(1) (b) and (c) of the 2002 Act, namely on  human
   rights and race relations grounds.  This  limited  right  of  appeal  was
   recognised by the Judge.

21. The first challenge set out in the grounds of appeal is that  the  Judge
   failed to make a clear finding  that  family  life  existed  at  all  and
   therefore that Article 8 was engaged. The permission is equivocal  as  to
   whether the appeal was limited in its grant. However I am satisfied  that
   even were I to proceed on the basis that permission had been granted I am
   satisfied that the Judge has accepted that family life exists because the
   Appellant is married to the sponsor and they have a child  together.  The
   Judge set out in paragraph 5 that  the  parties  all  lived  together  in
   Bangladesh until the sponsor and their child moved to the UK.

22. The cases cited at paragraph  13  and  14  above  make  clear  that  the
   starting point in a visit visa case must be  whether  the  Appellant  can
   meet the requirements of paragraph 41 of the Rules as this is relevant to
   the  issue  of  proportionality.  This  application  was  refused   under
   paragraph 41 (i) (ii) (vi) and (vii). The background  against  which  the
   application was made was that the Appellant intended to make a settlement
   application but it was accepted that as the sponsor had not  resolved  an
   application made for DLA the financial requirements of Appendix FM  could
   not be met.

23. I am satisfied that in assessing whether the Appellant would  return  at
   the end of her visit the Judge found that the Appellant would  return  in
   order to make the spouse application because 'she is almost certain to be
   successful.' In reaching this conclusion the Judge had no evidence before
   her as to whether the Appellant could meet the language requirements  and
   also failed to adequately explain why she accepted that the sponsor's DLA
   application was likely to be successful when it had not been resolved  by
   the time of the decision or indeed by the hearing date of 6  March  2015.
   Had the Judge not accepted that the spousal application was  so  sure  to
   succeed she may not have accepted the Appellants willingness to return at
   the end of her trip. This failure to adequately resolve disputed issues I
   consider to be material since had the Tribunal  conducted  this  exercise
   the outcome could have been different. That in my  view  is  the  correct
   test to apply.

24. I also note that the Judge failed  to  address  the  other  grounds  for
   refusal under paragraph 41 (v) and (vi). Clearly the extent to which  the
   Appellant  cannot  meet  the  Rules  is  a   relevant   factor   to   the
   proportionality assessment  and  failure  to  resolve  these  issues  are
   therefore material errors of law.

25.  The  Judge  has  failed  to  consider  the  statutory  public  interest
   considerations as set out in section 117B of the Nationality  Immigration
   and Asylum Act 2002 indeed there is no reference to the  public  interest
   at all and thus the decision is not a  balancing  exercise  but  only  an
   enumeration of factors in the Appellants favour.

26. The Judge's finding that it is in the best interest of  the  Appellant's
   child for her to visit the UK is challenged in that  it  is  inadequately
   reasoned. I am satisfied that the Judge has given  no  reasons  for  this
   conclusion particularly given that living in  separate  countries  was  a
   choice made by the parties and there was no evidence that the sponsor and
   child could not continue to visit the Appellant in Bangladesh

27. I therefore found that errors of law have been established and that  the
   Judge's determination cannot stand and must be set aside in its entirety.
   Both parties indicated that they  were  content  for  me  to  remake  the
   decision in those circumstances without a further hearing.

Remaking the Decision
28.  I  have  looked  at  all  of  the  evidence  in  the  round  whether  I
   specifically refer to it or not.
29. The Appellant appeals the decision of the Respondent on the  basis  that
   the decision is unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

30. I have determined the issue on the basis of the questions posed by  Lord
   Bingham in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27


Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public authority with  the
exercise of the applicant's right to respect for  his  private  (or  as  the
case may be) family life?

31. The undisputed background against which the Appellant applied for  entry
   clearance to the UK was that the  Appellant  married  the  Sponsor  Ajmot
   Ullah in Bangladesh on 26 September 2001. At that time  Mr  Ullah  had  a
   wife in the UK and therefore he could not have brought the  Appellant  to
   the UK as his spouse until 2007 at the earliest when his first wife died.
   On 22 October 2003 the Appellant and Mr Ullah had a child in  Bangladesh.
   While the sponsor was therefore apparently living in Bangladesh  in  2003
   with his wife and child it is unclear from the evidence before me when he
   returned to the UK with his son but is accepted that they  are  both  now
   living in the UK now. Nevertheless, I accept that the Sponsor  and  their
   child have enjoyed family life together in Bangladesh and are entitled to
   have respect shown for their enjoyment of family life in the future.

If  so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such  gravity  as
potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?


32. It  is  arguable  that  there  is  no  interference  in  refusing  entry
   clearance given that there was no evidence before me that the sponsor and
   child could not visit the Appellant in Bangladesh: while the  sponsor  is
   82 and in poor health there is no medical evidence to suggest that he  is
   unable to travel. However even if I were  wrong  I  have  considered  the
   position on the basis that   removal  would  have  consequences  of  such
   gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8.


If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


33. I am satisfied that there is in place the legislative framework for  the
   decision giving rise to the interference with Article 8 rights  which  is
   precise and accessible enough for the Appellant to regulate  her  conduct
   by reference to it.


If so, is such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being  of
the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection  of
health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedom  of
others?


34. The interference does have legitimate aims since it  is  in  pursuit  of
   one of the legitimate aims set out in Article 8 (2) necessary in  pursuit
   of the economic well being of the country through the maintenance of  the
   requirements of a policy of immigration control. The state has the  right
   to control the entry of non nationals into its territory  and  Article  8
   does not mean that an individual can choose where she wishes to enjoy her
   private and family life.


If so, is such interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  public  end
sought to be achieved?


35. In making the assessment I have also taken into  account  ZH  (Tanzania)
   (FC)  (Appellant)  v  Secretary  of  State  for   the   Home   Department
   (Respondent) [2011] UKSC 4 where Lady Hale  noted  Article  3(1)  of  the
   UNCRC which states that "in  all  actions  concerning  children,  whether
   undertaken  by  ...  courts  of  law,   administrative   authorities   or
   legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall  be  a  primary
   consideration."

36. Article 3 is now reflected in section 55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship
   and Immigration Act 2009 which provides that, in  relation,  among  other
   things, to immigration, asylum or nationality,  the  Secretary  of  State
   must make arrangements for ensuring that those functions "are  discharged
   having regard to the  need  to  safeguard  and  promote  the  welfare  of
   children who are in the United Kingdom".   Lady  Hale  stated  that  "any
   decision which is taken without having regard to the  need  to  safeguard
   and promote the  welfare  of  any  children  involved  will  not  be  "in
   accordance with the law" for the purpose of article 8(2)".  Although  she
   noted that national authorities were expected to treat the best interests
   of a child as "a primary consideration", she added  "Of  course,  despite
   the looseness with which these  terms  are  sometimes  used,  "a  primary
   consideration" is not the same as "the primary consideration", still less
   as "the paramount consideration".

37. In relation to the Appellant's child I find that in determining  whether
   it would be in the best interests of the him to have the Appellant  visit
   the United Kingdom I of course accept that the  starting  point  is  that
   children should live with both parents. That does not however mean that a
   decision to refuse entry clearance is disproportionate. It  is  a  factor
   that we have taken into account and of course placed considerable  weight
   upon.

38. There is no evidence from either the child  himself  or  the  mother  to
   suggest that his needs are not being properly  met  by  living  with  his
   father. There was no evidence from any source to suggest that he  is  not
   being properly cared for by his father for  while  the  father  does  not
   enjoy good health the child is now 13 years old and needs less 'hands  on
   'parenting and has lived for many years apart from his mother.

39. The decision taken by these parents as to what was in the  child's  best
   interest was that he should come to the United Kingdom with  his  father,
   separated from his mother. There has been no satisfactory evidence before
   me that circumstances have changed and no satisfactory evidence before me
   why their view that it was in the  best  interest  of  the  child  to  be
   brought up in this manner had changed. While it  may  well  be  that  the
   child misses his mother there is in fact  no  evidence  to  that  effect.
   Indeed there was no evidence to suggest  that  he  could  not  visit  his
   mother in Bangladesh either with his father or alone.


40. Therefore I am satisfied that there were no reasons to believe that  the
   present arrangements were not taken in the best interests  of  the  child
   and nothing has changed other than the passage of time.


41. I now turn to the wider  proportionality  assessment  and  I  take  into
   accounts those factors which I am obliged to consider under section  117B
   of the 2002 Act:


42. I take into  account  that  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
   controls is in the public interest. I note in  this  context  that  while
   this is not an appeal against the refusal  under  the  Immigration  Rules
   that the Appellant did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules
   which underpin immigration control in the UK.


43. In relation to the concern that the Appellant will not return this  case
   has been argued by the Appellant on the basis that this was a short visit
   and then she would return to Bangladesh to make a spouse application that
   was bound to succeed. If I were satisfied of this  I  would  accept  that
   this was a powerful incentive as  otherwise,  given  that  the  Appellant
   accepts that her closest family, the sponsor and child, both live in  the
   UK and she is financially completely dependent on the Sponsor and has not
   produced any evidence of other family, assets or property  in  Bangladesh
   and clearly wants to join  her  husband  she  would  appear  to  have  no
   incentive to return to Bangladesh.


44. I am not satisfied however that  there  is  evidence  that  the  spousal
   application will succeed indeed on the basis of the evidence before me it
   would fail. Appendix FM has a language requirement and the  Appellant  is
   not exempt from this. There is  no  evidence  that  she  has  passed  the
   language requirement. It was  asserted  with  the  application  that  the
   sponsors claim for DLA would be resolved by June 2014 and this would meet
   the requirements of Appendix FM: however, it was  not  resolved  by  June
   2014, nor was it resolved by March 2015 when  the  case  was  before  the
   first tier tribunal and the resolution was described as 'imminent'. There
   was no additional evidence placed  before  me  to  suggest  that  it  has
   subsequently been resolved and a spousal application made.  Therefore,  I
   am not satisfied that it is open to me to conclude that the inevitability
   of a successful spousal application  would  encourage  the  Appellant  to
   return at the end of her trip as is suggested. Indeed it seems to me that
   there is little in Bangladesh for her to return to, her  family  and  her
   funds are in the UK.


45.  The  refusal  letter  also  challenged  whether  there   was   adequate
   accommodation. The sponsor  had  an  address  and  there  was  a  tenancy
   agreement at the time of the application and I accept that this issue was
   addressed. I am not satisfied that the Appellant has addressed the  issue
   of paying for return flights and maintenance. While the sponsor  produced
   an account which at one point in February had a balance  of  �810.94  for
   all of January the balance was under �240. I  do  not  accept  that  this
   demonstrates that the sponsor can, as  the  Appellant  asserts,  pay  for
   return airfares and the additional cost of maintaining her together  with
   him and his son.


46. While I accept that the ability to speak English is not as  relevant  to
   a visitor as to someone who seeks to settle there is no evidence  whether
   the Appellant speaks English or not.


47. On the basis of the financial evidence  produced  before  me  I  am  not
   satisfied that the sponsor could adequately maintain the Appellant if she
   were to visit the UK. The Appellant is  not  financially  independent  in
   that she relies on funds from the Appellant.


48. I also find that there has been no evidence placed before me to  suggest
   that the sponsor and child could not visit the Appellant in Bangladesh as
   they certainly lived there with her for a number of  years.  The  medical
   evidence lists a number of issues that the sponsor has  with  his  health
   and while accept they are not trivial and he is 82 years old but there is
   no suggestion he cannot travel and his age alone  does  not  evidence  an
   inability to travel.

49. It has also been suggested that a  spousal  application  would  be  made
   when the sponsors DLA application was resolved: while there may have been
   no evidence of this before me that does not  mean  that  it  may  not  be
   resolved soon and such an application could be  made.   Moreover  I  have
   reminded myself on R (on the application of Chen) v SSHD (Appendix  FM  -
   Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189
   (IAC).. In all cases, it will be for the individual to place  before  the
   Secretary of State evidence that such temporary separation will interfere
   disproportionately with protected rights. It will not be enough  to  rely
   solely upon the case-law concerning Chikwamba  v  SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  40.
   There was  no  evidence  before  me  that  such  a  separation  would  be
   disproportionate.

50. I have considered whether I have been  provided  with  evidence  of  any
   compelling circumstances in this case which  would  warrant  a  grant  of
   leave outside the Rules. I am satisfied that no such  evidence  has  been
   identified to me: the Appellant does not meet  the  requirements  of  the
   Rules as a visitor and indeed although not the subject of this appeal but
   nevertheless relevant to it she does not yet appear to be  able  to  meet
   the requirements for settlement under Appendix FM. There is no reason why
   the Rules should not apply to her as they do to every other applicant.

51. In determining  whether  the  refusal  would  be  proportionate  to  the
   legitimate aim of immigration control I  find  that  none  of  the  facts
   underpinning the Appellant's relationship with her family in  the  United
   Kingdom taken either singularly or cumulatively outweigh  the  legitimate
   purpose of the refusal decision.

Conclusion

52. Given all of my findings set out above and  taking  fully  into  account
   the best interests of the child I am satisfied that the refusal of  entry
   clearance in this case was proportionate.

Decision

53. There was an error on a point of law in the decision of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal with regard to Article 8 such that the decision is set aside

54. I remake the appeal.

55. I dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds
