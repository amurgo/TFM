For the Appellant:           Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Mbrariti, Johl and Company Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of China date of birth 11th November 1989.
     On the 7th May 2014 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge De  Haney)  allowed
    her appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse  to
    vary her leave to remain and to remove  her  pursuant  to  s47  of  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


 2. The Respondent had applied for further leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant. She had come to the UK in order to study for
    a Masters degree, for which she was paying the University of  Liverpool
    a fee of �11,862. Before she could start that course she  was  required
    to take a short English language course. She was granted leave to enter
    as a Tier 4 Migrant in order to take that course and  then  applied  to
    extend her visa so that she could start her Masters.

 3. The Secretary of State refused to grant such leave on the grounds  that
    the Respondent had not demonstrated that  she  had  adequate  funds  in
    place. She was required to show that she had �19,062 for a period of 28
    days. Paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix C stipulates that the "end of the  28
    day period will be taken to be the closing balance on the  most  recent
    of the specified  documents".   Since  the  bank  statements  submitted
    closed on the 24th September 2013 that was the date picked.  There  had
    to be �19,062 in the account/s for a continual 28  period  between  the
    28th August 2013 and the 24th September 2013.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the Secretary of State's  point  about
    paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix C. If the 'start date'  was  taken  as  the
    28th August the Respondent was indeed short of approximately �7,000  on
    that day. The appeal accordingly fell to be dismissed under the  Rules.
    The First-tier Tribunal went on to note that if the 28 day  period  had
    been taken to run from the 29th August 2013 to the 25th September  2013
    the Respondent had  the  requisite  amount  of  funds.   Had  the  bank
    statements ended one day later than they did, the Respondent would have
    been successful in her application. That  this  was  so  was  evidenced
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  production   of   the   original
    statements. The Tribunal noted the terms of the Secretary of  State  's
    'evidential flexibility' policy  discussed  in  Rodriguez  [2013]  UKUT
    00042 (IAC) and remarked that the failure to  ask  the  Respondent  for
    further bank statements was a decision of which Franz  Kafka  would  be
    proud. Turning to consider Article 8 the determination finds  that  the
    Respondent is a bona fide student who has already committed  in  excess
    of �20,000 to her education here. All this would be lost if she was not
    permitted to complete the Masters degree that she came here to do.  The
    Tribunal had regard to recent visit of the  Mayor  of  London  and  the
    Chancellor of the Exchequer to China when they declared that the UK was
    "open for business" for Chinese students and  business.   The  Tribunal
    did not consider that the Secretary of State had shown  this  decision,
    with its serious consequences for the Respondent, to  be  proportionate
    and  allowed  the  appeal  on  the  ground  that  it  was  an  unlawful
    interference with the Respondent's private life.


 5. The Secretary of State  now  has  permission  to  appeal  against  that
    decision on the grounds that the Tribunal failed to have regard to  the
    authorities of Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC
    720 (Admin). It  is  submitted  that  the  Tribunal  should  only  have
    considered  Article  8  if  there  were  compelling  circumstances  not
    recognised by the Rules.



    Error of Law

 6. These grounds  were  evidently  drafted  before  the  Court  of  Appeal
    decision in MM v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 was handed down. At paragraph
    128 Aikens LJ considers  the  proposition  that  cases  such  as  Nagre
    introduced some second hurdle for claimants to get over in establishing
    an Article 8 case:


         ...Nagre does  not  add  anything  to  the  debate,  save  for  the
         statement that if a particular person is outside the rule  then  he
         has to demonstrate, as a preliminary to a consideration outside the
         rule, that he has an arguable case that there may be  good  grounds
         for granting leave to remain outside the rules. I cannot  see  much
         utility in  imposing  this  further,  intermediary,  test.  If  the
         applicant cannot satisfy the rule, then there either is or there is
         not a further Article 8 claim.


 7. In this case Judge De Haney plainly considered  that  there  were  good
    grounds for granting leave to  remain.  He  identified  the  compelling
    circumstances as the fact that  this  genuine  student  stood  to  lose
    upwards of  �20,000  and  waste  a  year  of  her  life.  There  is  no
    requirement in law that he impose a further intermediary test.  He  had
    found the decision to interfere with the Respondent's private life  and
    in those circumstances the burden of establishing that the interference
    was justified and proportionate fell on the Secretary  of  State.  That
    burden was not discharged. The decision was open to the  Judge  on  the
    facts and the determination contains no error of law.




      Decision

 8. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error  of  law
    and it is upheld.
