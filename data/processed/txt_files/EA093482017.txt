For the Appellant:     Mr Donkersley, Sheffield Citizens Advice
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Romania. She appealed to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Telford) against a decision of the Secretary  of  State
    dated 15 November 2016 refusing to  issue  her  a  Permanent  Residence
    Card. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed her appeal and she now appeals,
    with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. At the Upper Tribunal initial hearing in Bradford on  3  October  2018,
    both parties told me that they now agreed that the First-tier  Tribunal
    had erred in law such that its decision  fell  to  be  set  aside  and,
    further, that the decision should be remade allowing  the  appeal.  The
    Secretary of State now agrees  that,  for  the  reasons  given  in  the
    grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the appellant is  entitled  to
    receive a Permanent Residence Card.




Notice of Decision

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 22 February 2018
    is set aside. I have  remade  the  decision.  The  appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision dated 15 November 2018 is allowed.
