For the Appellants:    Mr E Fripp, instructed by Pegasus Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellants appeal, with permission, against the decision of  the  First-
tier Tribunal dismissing their appeals  against  the  respondent's  decision
refusing their asylum and human rights claim.

The appellants, nationals of Pakistan,  are  wife,  husband  and  their  two
children, born respectively on [ ] 1978, [ ] 1979, [ ] 2011 and  [  ]  2014.
The first two appellants arrived in the UK on 13 March  2011  as  a  Tier  4
Student Migrant and a Tier 4 Dependant Migrant, with leave to enter until  6
July 2012. The first appellant applied for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  2
General Migrant but her application was  refused.  She  did  not  pursue  an
appeal against that decision  and  became  appeal  rights  exhausted  on  29
November 2012 and overstayed. On  18  November  2013  she  was  served  with
papers as an overstayer. On 11 February 2014 she made  an  Article  8  human
rights claim, but that was refused.


On 11 December 2014 the first appellant applied for asylum, with  the  other
three appellants as her dependants. The asylum claim was refused on  19  May
2015 and the appellants appealed against that  decision.  The  appeals  were
heard in the First-tier Tribunal and dismissed. Permission to appeal to  the
Upper Tribunal was granted on 4 December 2017.

The Appellant's Case

The first appellant ("the appellant") claims that  she  was  engaged  to  be
married to her cousin in order to settle an eight year family feud  but  she
did not  want  the  marriage  and  after  four  years  she  called  off  the
engagement. Two to two and a half years prior to that she started an  affair
with her current husband and one year prior to the engagement  being  called
off her fiancï¿½ found out about the affair. A year and a half  to  two  years
after the engagement was called off, her husband  persuaded  his  mother  to
let him marry her and her parents agreed to the marriage. They were  married
in June 2008 and went to live with her husband's family.  Her  mother-in-law
mistreated her and made her do all the housework. In 2009 she fell  pregnant
and had an illegal abortion as she could not cope with  the  pregnancy.  Her
mother found out  about  the  abortion  as  she  had  to  go  hospital.  She
subsequently  fell  pregnant  again  but  had  a  miscarriage  and  on  that
occasion, in 2010, her mother-in-law found out about the previous  abortion.
The appellant claimed that her husband's family wanted him  to  marry  again
but he did not want to leave her. She fell pregnant again and her  husband's
friend suggested that they leave Pakistan to get  away  from  the  problems.
She feared that her life would be at risk if she returned to Pakistan.

The  respondent,  in  refusing  the  appellant's  claim,  noted   that   the
appellant's documentary evidence referred to two  miscarriages  rather  than
an abortion and miscarriage. The respondent considered the medical  evidence
produced from  Pakistan  but  accorded  it  little  weight.  The  respondent
considered that the appellant's credibility was undermined by the fact  that
she had provided misleading information to the  Home  Office  and  had  been
willing to  employ  deception  to  remain  in  the  UK  in  respect  of  her
application for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  2  general  migrant.  In  the
circumstances the respondent did not accept the appellant's  claim  to  have
been mistreated by her in-laws and to have undergone  an  illegal  abortion.
The respondent considered in any event  that  there  was  a  sufficiency  of
protection available to the appellant and that she  could  also  safely  and
reasonably relocate with her family to another part of Pakistan.

The appellants'  appeal  against  that  decision  was  heard  by  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Goodrich on 15 February  2016  and  26  April  2016  and  was
dismissed in a decision promulgated on 6 June 2016. The  appellant  and  her
husband gave evidence  before  the  judge.  The  appellant  claimed  in  her
evidence that she had not  employed  deception  in  regard  to  her  Tier  2
application but was the victim of the agent who had claimed to have  an  in-
depth knowledge of the immigration laws. She  had  believed  that  the  work
permit for which the agent had applied was legitimate  and  that  she  would
have to undertake only a short course of study to obtain  the  required  MBA
qualification. She would be imprisoned in Pakistan as  a  result  of  having
had an illegal abortion. She also feared  being  the  victim  of  an  honour
killing and could not live safely anywhere in Pakistan.


The judge noted that the appellant, in her previous  application  for  leave
to remain on private life grounds in  early  2014,  had  given  a  different
reason for leaving Pakistan, namely that her and her husband were  subjected
to caste discrimination, that they were from different  castes,  that  their
wedding took  place  without  their  families  knowing  and  that  when  the
families found out they were disowned. The judge considered that  the  claim
in regard to caste differences  was  inconsistent  with  evidence  that  the
appellant's mother and mother-in-law were in fact sisters. The  judge  noted
that the appellant's evidence as to whether or not her parents and  her  in-
laws consented to their marriage  varied  in  her  different  accounts.  The
judge also noted the absence of any  mention  in  that  application  to  the
circumstances of the claim now relied upon. The judge  also  noted  evidence
confirming that  the  appellant  had  had  two  miscarriages  and  that  the
accounts given by the appellant and her husband about  the  claimed  illegal
abortion were  inconsistent.  The  judge  did  not  accept  the  appellant's
explanation as to her lack of knowledge in regard to the Tier 2  application
and considered that she had attended an MBA course for two weeks  solely  in
order to assist her in remaining in the UK. She did not accept  the  reasons
given by the appellant for ceasing her studies in March  2012,  namely  that
her daughter [JS] was ill, as the evidence showed that [JS]  had  been  well
for some time since her discharge from hospital in October 2011.  The  judge
considered that the appellant's delay  in  claiming  asylum  undermined  her
credibility. The judge did not find the appellant  and  her  husband  to  be
reliable and credible witnesses and rejected her claim, considering that  it
had been fabricated in order to enable her to stay  in  the  UK.  The  judge
considered that the appellants would be at no risk  on  return  to  Pakistan
and that their removal would not breach their human rights on Articles 2,  3
or 8 grounds.

The appellant sought permission to appeal Judge Goodrich's decision, over  a
year out of time, on the following three grounds: Firstly, that  there  were
mistakes of fact in the decision and a  failure  to  consider  all  relevant
evidence. The judge, when rejecting the appellant's explanation for  ceasing
her studies, failed to take account of a letter from the appellant's  GP  in
regard to her daughter's illness, failed to take account of the  appellant's
full explanation for undergoing an  abortion,  failed  to  take  account  of
references in the appellant's current claim to caste differences and  failed
to consider the appellant's explanation as to why her husband's  family  did
not report the illegal abortion to the  police.  Secondly,  that  the  judge
failed adequately to consider the appellant's explanation for her  delay  in
claiming asylum. Thirdly, that the judge's findings on  internal  relocation
failed adequately to take into account the country evidence.


Permission to appeal was granted to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, with  time
being extended, on all grounds, but primarily on the basis  that  the  judge
had arguably erred in fact, in making an adverse credibility  finding  based
upon the  appellant's  daughter's  heath  which  was  arguably  against  the
medical evidence.

Appeal hearing and submissions

The  appeal  came  before  me  on  29  January  2018.  Both   parties   made
submissions.

Mr Fripp submitted that the judge's  credibility  findings  were  flawed  as
they  failed  to  take  account  of  the  medical  letter  relating  to  the
appellant's disabled daughter at page 183 of the appeal  bundle  and  failed
to take account  of  the  evidence  regarding  domestic  violence  from  the
appellant's mother-in-law. The judge erred  at  [31]  in  finding  that  the
appellant's claim had changed, whereas it had just developed. The  appellant
had mentioned caste differences in her current claim  at  questions  107  to
112 of her interview and it was clear that the  current  circumstances  were
simply a continuation of those previously  stated.  The  appellant  had  not
changed her account of the earlier abortion but had simply been reticent  to
mention it subsequently.


Mr Tarlow submitted that the appellant's grounds were simply a  disagreement
with the judge's validly made findings  and  any  error  in  regard  to  the
doctor's letter was not material.

Consideration and findings.

I am entirely in agreement with Mr Tarlow that the grounds  and  submissions
were little more than a disagreement with the judge's findings. The  judge's
decision is a very detailed and careful one and it is clear that  the  judge
had full regard to all the evidence in making her findings  and  gave  clear
and cogent reasons for making the  adverse  credibility  findings  that  she
did.

It was Mr Fripp's submission that the judge had erred  in  finding  at  [31]
that the information provided by the appellant for her various  applications
had changed and  that  it  was  a  simply  a  matter  of  her  claim  having
developed. However the judge was perfectly entitled  to  consider  that  the
appellant had provided, in her current claim, a  different  account  of  her
reasons for not being able to return to Pakistan to  that  previously  given
in  her  previous  Article  8  human  rights  claim  in  January  2014.  The
differences in the appellant's accounts were  explained  in  detail  by  the
judge at [31(d)] and thereafter. Mr  Fripp  submitted  that  the  judge  had
ignored the fact that the appellant had mentioned caste differences  in  her
interview for  her  current  claim  and  was  thus  developing  the  account
previously given, but it seems to me that the judge plainly  had  regard  to
the appellant's evidence about caste differences at  the  interview,  noting
at [31(d)] that that was not, however, the core basis  on  which  the  claim
was now being pursued.


With regard to the  appellant's  account  of  having  undergone  an  illegal
abortion and the fact that that was mentioned for the  first  time  only  at
the screening interview, Mr Fripp submitted that the  judge  had  failed  to
consider that people may be reticent to talk about such  matters  and  ought
to have been sensitive to the appellant in  that  regard.  The  grounds,  at
[21] and [22] also criticise the judge's  adverse  credibility  findings  at
[38(b)] in regard to the abortion and assert that there  was  a  failure  to
consider the appellant's evidence about being a victim of domestic  violence
which provided the context for the abortion.  However it is clear  that  the
judge considered all the evidence about the claimed abortion  in  the  round
and was entitled to make the  adverse  findings  that  she  did.  The  judge
plainly did take into account the  appellant's  explanation  about  her  in-
law's mistreatment at [38(b)] but rejected it in light of the various  other
reasons given at [38] for considering that the claim was  not  credible,  in
particular the inconsistent evidence noted at [38(d)] and the fact that  the
account of the abortion differed significantly to  the  evidence  previously
given that she had had two miscarriages. It seems to  me  that  the  judge's
adverse findings in regard to the abortion took account of all the  evidence
and were plainly fully and cogently reasoned and entirely open to the  judge
on the evidence before her.

The main basis upon which permission was granted  was  the  judge's  alleged
failure to take into account a medical letter dated 5  February  2013  which
it was asserted contradicted the judge's findings at  [43]  in  relation  to
the genuineness of the appellant's studies,  her  reasons  for  ceasing  her
studies and the credibility of her  reasons  in  general  for  applying  for
leave to remain in the UK. The judge considered at [43] that  the  appellant
had not provided a genuine reason for discontinuing  her  studies  in  March
2012 and that the reason she had given, namely her daughter's  illness,  was
contradicted by the medical evidence which confirmed that her  daughter  had
been discharged from hospital in October 2011 and had been well since  then.
The grounds assert that the doctor's letter of 15  February  2013,  at  page
183 of the appeal bundle, confirmed that the appellant's  daughter  had  not
been well since October 2011. However the judge took  all  of  the  evidence
into account and I do not accept that she overlooked  that  letter  or  that
the letter in any event undermines the judge's findings in any respect.  The
letter confirms the appellant's daughter's life threatening condition  which
caused her to be admitted to hospital,  but  the  judge  was  plainly  fully
aware of that, as is seen  from  her  detailed  assessment  of  the  medical
evidence at [64]. The letter takes the matter  no  further,  stating  simply
that the appellant's daughter was unwell in January and February  2013,  but
providing no further details  nor  suggesting  in  any  way  that  that  was
related to her illness in October 2011. I fail to see  how  that  undermined
the judge's finding  at  [43]  rejecting  the  appellant's  explanation  for
ceasing her studies in March 2012.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  judge  was
perfectly entitled to make the adverse findings that she did in that  regard
and in regard to the appellant's immigration history and her  motivation  in
making the various applications that she did.

Accordingly I find no merit in the assertion in the grounds that  the  judge
failed to consider relevant matters or that she made mistakes of  fact.  The
judge provided clear and cogent reasons for making the  adverse  credibility
findings that she did. She was entitled to  draw  adverse  conclusions  from
the inconsistencies in the appellant's evidence, the different  reasons  she
had provided for wishing to remain in the UK and being unable to  return  to
Pakistan, and from the significant delay in her claim  for  asylum  and  the
circumstances under which she made  that  claim.  The  judge  was  perfectly
entitled to find that the appellant's claim was not a genuine  and  credible
one and to conclude that neither she nor her husband or child  were  at  any
risk on  return  to  Pakistan.  Mr  Fripp,  quite  properly,  did  not  make
submissions on the grounds asserting a failure to consider country  evidence
and referring to internal  relocation.  The  judge  in  fact  had  full  and
extensive regard to the country evidence and  provided  cogent  reasons  for
concluding that internal relocation was an option  reasonably  open  to  the
appellant, but in any event those matters are immaterial  in  light  of  the
adverse findings made.

For all of these reasons I conclude that the judge  was  perfectly  entitled
to reach the conclusions that she did on the evidence  before  her  for  the
reasons fully and properly given. The grounds of appeal do not disclose  any
errors of law in the judge's decision.

DECISION

The appellants'  appeals  are  accordingly  dismissed.  The  making  of  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve an error on a  point  of
law, such that the decision has to be set aside. I  do  not  set  aside  the
decision. The decision to dismiss the appellants' appeals therefore stands.

    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an order for anonymity.  I  maintain  that
    order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.
