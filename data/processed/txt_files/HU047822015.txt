                          MOHAMED IRFAN HUSEIN MALEK
                          (NO ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 7 September 2017 I gave the following directions:-

   1. Having had regard to the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, and  the
      grounds upon which permission to appeal was granted; and,  having  had
      regard to  the  rule  24  response  from  the  respondent,  it  is  my
      preliminary view that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved
      the making of an error of law in that Judge Majid erred in failing  to
      make any proper findings  of  fact,  and  failed  properly  to  direct
      himself in law.


   2. It is therefore my preliminary view that the decision  of  the  First-
      tier Tribunal should be set aside and that the appropriate  course  of
      action would be to remit the case to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
      fresh determination on all issues.


   3. Unless within ten working days of the issue of these directions  there
      is any written objection to this course of action, supported by cogent
      argument, the Upper Tribunal will  proceed  to  determine  the  appeal
      without an oral hearing and will remit it to the First-tier Tribunal.


   4. In the absence of a timely response by a party, it  will  be  presumed
      that it has no objection to the course of action proposed


 2. There has been  no  response  to  these  directions  by  either  party.
    Accordingly, I am satisfied that neither party objects  to  the  matter
    being determined without a hearing and has nothing further to say. I am
    satisfied that that the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
    involve the making of an error of law for the reasons  set  out  above,
    and must therefore be set aside.  Given the  nature  of  the  error,  I
    remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  determination
    on all issues.

Summary of conclusions

     1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making
        of an error of law and I set it aside.


     2. I remit the  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
        decision on all issues


     3. The appeal must not be before First-tier Tribunal Judge Majid




Signed                                             Date:  3 October 2017
