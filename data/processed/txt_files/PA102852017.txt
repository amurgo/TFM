Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Dakora, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant whose date of birth  is  [  ]  2001  appealed  against  a
    decision of the respondent dated 29 September 2017 refusing  his  claim
    for asylum and humanitarian protection in the United Kingdom.


 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  M.  R  Oliver  dismissed  the  appeal  in  a
    decision dated 14 December 2017. Permission to appeal  was  granted  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin in a decision dated 15 January  2018.
    She found that it is arguable that the Judge erred by  his  failure  to
    adequately consider the  appellant  was  a  child  when  assessing  his
    evidence and  credibility.  It  is  further  arguable  that  the  Judge
    misunderstood material evidence in respect of the contact  between  the
    appellant and his family with the Taliban. She also found  that  it  is
    arguable that the Judge misapplied the country guidance and  failed  to
    take into account the objective evidence in relation to Afghanistan.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  in  her  decision  made  the  following
    findings, which I summarise. The  appellant's  journey  to  the  United
    Kingdom demonstrates the  appellant's  resourcefulness  and  resilience
    beyond his  years.  He  brought  with  him  on  the  journey  very  few
    possessions, but quite the most important must  have  been  his  family
    contact details. At his screening interview 6� months after arriving in
    the United Kingdom he stated that he had a mobile  phone.  He  made  no
    mention of his phone or any contact with  his  family  in  his  witness
    statement 13 months after that. He had his maternal uncle's number with
    him on his phone on arrival in the United Kingdom because he said  that
    he had made a few phone calls to his maternal uncle and mother  shortly
    after arrival. He claims that he lost the number then found it but then
    it stopped working. It is difficult to accept that the appellant  would
    have come with such limited contact details with his extensive  family.
    If he had retained contact with his family,  his  mother  and  maternal
    uncle would have been able to provide evidence to confirm  his  account
    of events in Afghanistan and Pakistan.


 4. The appellant claimed to fear both the Taliban and the  authorities  in
    Afghanistan. The evidence he has given about his fear  of  the  Taliban
    comes from his paternal uncle's history of  his  involvement  with  the
    Taliban and of his father's moment with the Taliban is inconsistent. He
    has stated that his father and uncles were with the  Taliban  from  the
    beginning. He said that his father was still with them when the Taliban
    took him for training in the mountains. He has also said, however  that
    his father refused to let the Taliban take the appellant  for  training
    and that was when he stopped being with the Taliban. The appellant  has
    not  satisfactorily  explained  the  inconsistencies   cited   by   the
    respondent concerning the death of his father. He was only a child when
    he left, and I do not accept that  the  Taliban  would  have  means  of
    interest in coming to know of his return.



 5. The appellant's claimed fear of the authorities on return is predicated
    on the assumption that they knew of his father's  previous  involvement
    with the Taliban and would blame the  child  for  the  actions  of  the
    father. I have already alluded to the inconsistent role of  his  father
    in his account, but it is unclear how the authorities would have  known
    of his father's previous involvement with the Taliban. When asked about
    this, the appellant replied that  someone  had  probably  reported  his
    father do the authorities. It is not accepted that the appellant  would
    be wanted for questioning on return as someone suspected of involvement
    with the Taliban.



 6. The Judge rejected the appellant's claim that he has a  genuine,  well-
    founded fear of persecution on return to Afghanistan  from  either  the
    Taliban or the Afghan authorities. The appellant will  be  returned  to
    Kabul and despite the worsening security situation highlighted  in  the
    expert and  background  reports,  the  Judge  was  satisfied  that  the
    position has not changed to the point where sufficiency  of  protection
    does not still exist.  He  cited  the  case  of  AK  (article  15  (c))
    Afghanistan (CG) [2012] UKUT 00163. I do not accept that  a  young  man
    who has shown such a resourcefulness would have left without  retaining
    some means of contacting his sister in Kabul where she lives  with  her
    husband. The husband is a Tailor and, although  the  infrastructure  of
    Kabul is  straining  under  the  weight  of  its  expansion  with  high
    employment, the appellant will be returning with  family  accommodation
    and enhance skills in the labour market.


 7. Section 55 is no longer relevant because the appellant will be returned
    to Kabul as an adult. In any event his family are  not  in  the  United
    Kingdom with the exception of a brother with whom he is not in contact.
    He has developed certain skills and no doubt friendships in the  United
    Kingdom but has private life here has  always  been  developed  in  the
    knowledge that his day has been temporary. He has no  Article  8  claim
    which outweighs the public interest in the maintenance of  a  fair  but
    firm immigration.


 8. The grounds of appeal state the following which I summarise. The First-
    tier Tribunal Judge failed to treat  the  appellant  as  a  child  when
    assessing  his  credibility.  The   first-tier   Tribunal   Judge   has
    misunderstood material evidence. The Judge has misapplied the  relevant
    country guidance, failing  to  take  into  account  the  objective  and
    supporting evidence. He has failed to give adequate reasons and  failed
    to consider the appellant's best interest as a primary consideration.

Finding as to whether there is an Error of Law in the decision

 9. The main complaint against the First-tier Tribunal Judge is that in his
    credibility findings the Judge did  not  take  into  account  that  the
    appellant  was  a  child  and  should  have  considered  his   evidence
    accordingly. The Judge was entitled to find despite the appellant's age
    he demonstrated maturity  and  resourcefulness  by  travelling  to  the
    United Kingdom through several European countries which was beyond  his
    15 years of age which was the age that he entered the  United  Kingdom.
    There is no perversity and the conclusion that a  15-year-old  who  can
    travel by himself  from  Afghanistan  to  the  United  Kingdom  was  of
    sufficient maturity to be able to give consistent evidence.


10. The Judge did in take into account that the appellant was a  child  but
    nevertheless he was entitled to make adverse credibility findings.  The
    judge found that he has given inconsistent evidence  and  two  separate
    accounts of his father's death in his  interview  and  in  his  witness
    statement. The Judge was entitled to find that the appellant's evidence
    about his father's death should be consistent given that  it  would  be
    such an important event in his life.
    This
11. The Judge did not find credible that the  appellant  at  his  screening
    interview 6� months after arriving in the  United  Kingdom  had  stated
    that he had a mobile phone and yet made no mention  of  it  or  of  any
    contact with his family in his witness statement 13 months after  that.
    The evidence was that the appellant had  his  maternal  uncle's  number
    with him on his phone on arrival in the United Kingdom because he  said
    that he had made a few phone calls to his  maternal  uncle  and  mother
    shortly after arrival in this country. The Judge did  not  believe  the
    appellant's evidence that he lost the number, then found it but then it
    stopped working. The Judge was entitled to find that this evidence  was
    not credible and found it difficult to accept that the appellant  would
    have come with such limited contact details with his extensive  family.
    There is no perversity in this reasoning given that the  appellant  was
    15 years old when he came to this country and retaining  his  relatives
    telephone numbers would be very important for him.


12. The Judge found that the appellant had been inconsistent and  gave  two
    separate accounts of his  father's  death  in  his  interview  and  his
    witness statement. These are clearly inconsistent  accounts  which  the
    Judge was entitled  to  take  into  account  notwithstanding  that  the
    appellant was 15 when he left the country.  The Judge  found  that  the
    appellant claims that he fears the Taliban as well as  the  authorities
    in Afghanistan.


13. The Judge found that notwithstanding the  inconsistencies,  that  given
    that the appellant was only a child when he left  Afghanistan  and  was
    entitled not to accept  that  the  Taliban  would  have  the  means  or
    interest in coming to know of his return  to  Afghanistan.  This  is  a
    reasoned conclusion that the appellant's connection to the Taliban  was
    through his father and uncle and the Taliban  would  have  no  interest
    with appellant on his return. The reason for refusal letter set out  at
    paragraph 16  of  the  decision  states  that  the  objective  evidence
    concerning the recruitment of child soldiers by the  Taliban  and  with
    his father's profile within  the  group  that  he  did  not  allow  the
    appellant to join the Taliban. This evidence was accepted by the Judge.


14. The Judge did not accept for good reasons that  the  authorities  would
    have found out about the appellant's father's previous involvement with
    the Taliban given the appellant's evidence that his father stopped  the
    appellant being taken for training. The Judge did not  accept  that  he
    would be questioned by the authorities on return to  Afghanistan  about
    his involvement with the Taliban. The Judge was also entitled  to  find
    that the appellant's claimed father's past involvement with the Taliban
    would not put him at risk. This was a valid  conclusion  based  on  the
    evidence before the Judge.


15. There is no indication that the Judge has  misunderstood  the  evidence
    before him. He set out the appellant's case from paragraph 12-15 and it
    is clear from the decision that there is no error in his  understanding
    of the facts of the appeal.


16. The Judge said that the appellant can be return to Kabul as  he  has  a
    sister living there with her husband. He considered  the  2012  country
    guidance case and stated that  as  a  young  man  who  has  shown  such
    resourcefulness could relocate to Kabul and  find  a  job  due  to  his
    enhance skills in the labour market.


17. After this decision a new country guidance case of AS (Safety of Kabul)
    Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT  00118  (IAC)  has  been  promulgated  which
    states in the headnote which I set out below.

          "A person who is of lower-level interest for the Taliban (i.e. not
         a senior government or security services official, or a spy) is not
         at real risk of persecution from the Taliban in Kabul.


         Internal relocation to Kabul


         Having regard to the security and humanitarian situation  in  Kabul
         as well as the difficulties faced by the  population  living  there
         (primarily the urban poor but also IDPs and other returnees,  which
         are not dissimilar to the conditions  faced  throughout  may  other
         parts of Afghanistan); it will not, in general be  unreasonable  or
         unduly harsh for a single adult male in good health to relocate  to
         Kabul even if he does not have any specific connections or  support
         network in Kabul.


         However, the particular circumstances of  an  individual  applicant
         must be taken into account in the  context  of  conditions  in  the
         place of relocation, including a person's age, nature  and  quality
         of  support  network/connections  with   Kabul/Afghanistan,   their
         physical and mental  health,  and  their  language,  education  and
         vocational skills when determining whether a  person  falls  within
         the general position set out above.


         A person with a support network or specific connections in Kabul is
         likely to be in a more advantageous position on return,  which  may
         counter a particular vulnerability of an individual on return.


         Although Kabul suffered the highest number of  civilian  casualties
         (in the latest UNAMA figures from 2017) and the number of  security
         incidents is increasing, the proportion of the population  directly
         affected by the security situation is tiny.  The  current  security
         situation in Kabul is not at such a level  as  to  render  internal
         relocation unreasonable or unduly harsh".

18. Given the new guidance in the country guidance case on  Afghanistan,  I
    find that a differently  constituted  Tribunal  would  not  come  to  a
    different  conclusion  based  on  the  evidence  in  this  appeal.  The
    appellant is now a single adult male in good health and can relocate to
    Kabul safely even if he did not have anyone to  support  him.  He  does
    however have a sister living in Kabul with her husband. I do not accept
    the appellant's argument that his sister lives  with  her  husband  and
    therefore will not be  in  a  position  to  assist  the  appellant.  No
    background evidence was provided which states that  family  members  do
    not  support  each  other   in   Afghanistan.    In   the   appellant's
    circumstances, based on the findings of  the  Judge  it  would  not  be
    unreasonable or unduly harsh for the appellant to  internally  relocate
    to Kabul.


19. I find that the first-tier Tribunal Judge has not made a material error
    of law in his decision. He was entitled to reach the  conclusions  that
    he did on the evidence before him. I find that the  appellant's  appeal
    is no more than a quarrel with the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings
    and conclusion.


20. I therefore dismiss the appellant's appeal and uphold the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.
