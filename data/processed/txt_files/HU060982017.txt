Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr O Noor, counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the appellant against the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal dated 30 May  2018  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision of 24 April 2017 refusing her leave to remain  as
    a spouse.

Background

2.    The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born  on  25  April  1979.   She
    first came to the UK on 22 November 2013  with  entry  clearance  valid
    until 14 July 2016 as the spouse of her husband  and  sponsor.   On  11
    July 2016 she applied for further leave to  remain  in  that  capacity.
    The respondent notified the appellant's solicitors on 21 July 2016 that
    when the application was received by the respondent it did not  contain
    the passports or passport sized photographs.  On  3  October  2017  the
    respondent wrote again confirming that  there  was  no  record  of  the
    passports being received. The appellant was notified on 7 November 2016
    that her application was being treated as invalid as no photographs had
    been provided and no evidence submitted of an  application  for  a  new
    passport.

3.    It was the contention of  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  that  the
    passports and photographs had been enclosed with the  application  form
    and other documents but had been lost on their way to  the  respondent.
    Both the appellant and the sponsor obtained  replacement  passports  by
    the end of January/early  February  2017  and  on  20  April  2017  the
    appellant  made  a  further  application  for  leave  to  remain.   Her
    application was refused as, by that stage, she had become an overstayer
    and was unable to meet the eligibility requirements of the  Rules.  Her
    application was therefore considered under paras EX.1. and 276ADE(1).

4.    The respondent was not satisfied that  there  were  insurmountable  or
    very significant obstacles to family life continuing in Nigeria,  there
    were no exceptional circumstances outside  her  control  such  that  it
    would not be proportionate to require her to return there to make  such
    an application and there were no exceptional circumstances  meriting  a
    grant of leave outside the  Rules.   Her  application  was  accordingly
    refused.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.    At the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  appellant  and
    sponsor gave oral evidence adopting their witness statements  including
    a joint statement produced at the hearing.  It was their case that  the
    passports had been sent with the application  but  enquiries  with  the
    Home Office and Royal Mail had revealed they had been lost on route. It
    was accepted that this was not a case where there  were  insurmountable
    or very  significant  obstacles  for  the  purpose  of  EX.1.  or  para
    276ADE(1)(vi) [19].   It  was,  however,  argued  that,  save  for  the
    eligibility requirement, the appellant met requirements  of  the  Rules
    and that the ensuing injustice suffered by her as a result the loss  of
    the passports in the post,  attributable  to  no  fault  on  her  part,
    amounted to exceptional circumstances such that the appellant's removal
    would be disproportionate.

6.    The judge, however, was not satisfied that the passports were lost  in
    circumstances beyond the appellant's control amounting  to  exceptional
    circumstances.  His reasons are set out in [21] of the  decision.   The
    judge said there was no record of the theft or losses being reported to
    the Royal Mail, save for references in  letters  from  the  appellant's
    solicitors.  There was a Metropolitan Police letter  acknowledging  the
    report of an unspecified crime but no record of what crime was reported
    and  a  letter  from  the  Passport  Office  dated  24  November  2016,
    acknowledging that passports lost in the post had been returned  to  it
    by the Royal Mail but the judge commented that, at  its  highest,  that
    letter did not demonstrate that the passports were  enclosed  with  the
    application for leave to remain.  The judge referred to a  document  at
    A25, an envelope sent to the respondent which had been opened  but  the
    judge said that all it demonstrated was that that the letter  had  been
    opened at some point.  He said that  the  weaknesses  in  the  accounts
    provided by the appellant and the sponsor led him to conclude that this
    part of the case had not been established.   He  did  not  accept  that
    there  were  exceptional  circumstances  beyond  the  control  of   the
    appellant such that the refusal of leave  would  itself  amount  to  an
    exceptional circumstance [23].

7.    In the alternative, the judge said that even if he was satisfied  that
    the passports were lost in the post that would not  aid  the  appellant
    because of the delay between the rejection of the July 2016 application
    and the  eventual  submission  of  the  April  2017  application.   The
    appellant had been informed on 21 July 2016 and  3  October  2016  that
    documents were missing. These letters indicated that she  was  provided
    with an opportunity of producing fresh photographs and proof  that  she
    and her husband had applied for new passports.  However, there  was  no
    evidence of such  alternative  steps  being  taken  until  the  further
    application.  The judge found that there was  no  explanation  for  the
    delay in not submitting a further application until  April  2017,  when
    their new passports had been received in late January or early February
    2017.

8.     So  far  as  the  argument  that  the  appellants  would  succeed  an
    application for entry clearance and that the Rules had  been  met,  the
    judge did not accept this submission.  He rejected an argument that the
    fact the decision letter did not engage with  the  income  requirements
    meant that the respondent was deemed to have accepted  them  [27].   In
    any event, the judge was not satisfied that, as at the date of hearing,
    the documentary evidence produced supported  the  submission  that  the
    appellant could meet the financial requirements of the Rules.  The most
    recent material did not demonstrate that the minimum income requirement
    of �18,600 was met.  The judge referred to the  sponsor's  most  recent
    P60 for the tax year ending 5 April 2018 showing a total income for the
    tax year of �16,703.  The payslip dated 7 March 2018 recorded a monthly
    gross payment of �1322.40 and over the course of a year that would show
    an annual income of under �16,000.  He accepted that in April  and  May
    2018 the sponsor appeared to be earning a higher amount  which,  if  it
    continued, could exceed the minimum income  requirement.  He  commented
    that it might be that, properly analysed by an entry clearance  officer
    in due course, the sponsor's employment might meet the  minimum  income
    requirement but on the basis of the materials before him that was not a
    foregone conclusion and it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal to
    usurp the scrutiny role of the entry clearance officer  by  jumping  to
    conclusions not supported by the evidence [28].

9.    The judge went on to consider article 8.  He accepted that  the  first
    four Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 criteria were met  and  that  the  remaining
    issue was whether the appellant's removal would  be  proportionate  for
    the purposes of article 8.  The  judge  set  out  the  reasons  against
    removal at [33] and those for allowing the appellant to remain at [34].
     He concluded that the factors in favour  of  the  appellant's  removal
    outweighed  those  favouring  her  continued  residence  in   the   UK,
    commenting that there was a strong public interest in  the  maintenance
    of effective immigration controls, it was not clear that the  appellant
    would meet the requirements for entry clearance on the material  before
    the Tribunal, the entry clearance process was intended to ensure proper
    scrutiny was conducted in situations such as the present  and  that  to
    allow the appellant remain in these non-exceptional circumstances would
    undermine immigration control [35].  For these reasons the  appeal  was
    dismissed.

The Grounds and Submissions

10.   The grounds  argue  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  firstly  in  his
    assessment of whether the passports were stolen and secondly in the way
    he dealt with the financial threshold in the Rules.  Ground one at  [5]
    of the grounds sets out the evidence supporting the contention that the
    passports and photographs were enclosed with the application  but  were
    stolen or otherwise lost before reaching the respondent.  It is  argued
    that the weight of evidence, taking into  account  the  fact  that  the
    witness evidence was unchallenged, was  such  that  it  was  Wednesbury
    unreasonable to conclude  that  the  passport  had  not  been  lost  in
    circumstances beyond the appellant's control.

11.   This ground also  refers  to  the  delay  between  obtaining  the  new
    passports and submitting  a  further  application  and  points  to  the
    evidence produced that  the  appellant's  legal  representative  had  a
    number of serious medical conditions. He was admitted to hospital on 15
    January 2017 and was unable to make court appearances while recovering.
     It is also argued that the only reason the subsequent application  was
    refused under the Rules was because it was made more than 14 days since
    her leave to remain had expired.  As that was because the passports had
    been stolen in the post, there was an unduly harsh element in the  case
    which warranted consideration under article 8 outside the Rules.

12.   So far as the financial  threshold  is  concerned  the  second  ground
    argues that the starting point for an article 8 consideration should be
    whether the appellant met the Rules and that the relevant  date  should
    be the date of application.  Under the Rules the appellant  would  need
    to submit payslips covering the six-month period prior to the  date  of
    application and the evidence showed that the sponsor's total income  in
    the  six  months  prior  to  the  application  was   �12,944.5,   which
    demonstrated that his earnings could meet the annual income requirement
    of �18,600.

13.   Permission to appeal  was  refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but
    granted by the Upper Tribunal on the basis that it  was  arguable  that
    the First-tier judge took an incorrect approach to the  evidence  about
    the loss of the passports in the post and  to  the  financial  evidence
    which was arguably capable of showing that the Rules were  met  at  the
    date of the application/decision even if not by the  date  of  hearing,
    those matters having the potential to be  material  in  the  article  8
    assessment outside the Rules.

14.   Mr Noor adopted his grounds in his submissions.  He  argued  that  the
    judge's approach to the circumstances in which the passports  had  been
    lost was flawed.  The oral evidence had not  been  challenged  and  the
    documentary evidence provided more than adequate confirmation  of  that
    evidence.  The judge  put  the  threshold  too  high  when  considering
    whether the account given by the appellant was true.  If the  passports
    had been stolen in the circumstances described by the appellant, it was
    clear that she was not to blame and that this was  a  very  significant
    factor when considering the application outside the Rules.  He referred
    to and relied on [33] of TZ (Pakistan) v Secretary of State [2018] EWCA
    Civ 1109 which held that the critical issue was whether the strength of
    public policy in immigration control was outweighed by the strength  of
    the appellant's article 8 claim.

15.   He submitted that it was in the present case by the  circumstances  in
    which the appellant  had  found  herself  following  the  loss  of  the
    passports.  So far as the financial aspect of the Rules was  concerned,
    Mr Noor argued that there was no clear discussion by  the  judge  about
    what date should be applied and that he had erred by treating it as the
    date of the hearing when he should have been  considering  whether  the
    Rules had been met at the date of application.   He  further  submitted
    that the principles in Razgar had not been applied properly  and  that,
    in the circumstances of the appellant it must  be  disproportionate  to
    require her to go back to Nigeria to make a further application.

16.   Mr Lindsay submitted that the  judge  had  reached  findings  properly
    open to him for the reasons given.  To show irrationality in a  finding
    of fact required a high threshold and he  argued  that  the  judge  had
    given more than adequate  reasons  for  his  decision  on  whether  the
    passports had been lost in the circumstances as described. It  was  for
    the judge to assess the evidence and the  lack  of  something  directly
    contradicting the account did not mean that he was bound to  find  that
    the account was true.  In any event, he submitted that  the  judge  had
    been entitled to take into account  the  delay  between  receiving  the
    replacement passports and the further application.  The  fact  remained
    that the appellant could not bring herself within the  Rules  and  that
    when considering the application outside the Rules proper consideration
    had to be given to the respondent's policy as set  out  in  the  Rules.
    The judge been entitled to find that the appellant had failed  to  show
    that there were sufficiently exceptional  circumstances  to  justify  a
    grant of leave outside the Rules.  He had carried out a full  balancing
    exercise at [33]-[35] and had reached a decision properly open to him.

Consideration of the whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law

17.   I must consider whether the judge erred in law such that the  decision
    should be set aside.  The first issue is whether  the  judge  erred  in
    finding at [23] that the appellant  had  not  discharged  the  onus  of
    showing  that  the  passports  had  been  lost  in  the   circumstances
    described.  To a large extent, ground one is an attempt to re-argue  an
    issue of fact. It was  for  the  judge  to  decide  what  weight  could
    properly be given to the oral evidence and whether and to  what  extent
    the documentary evidence provided support for that evidence.

18.   It is correct that the oral evidence was unchallenged  to  the  extent
    that the respondent was not represented at the hearing and there was no
    cross examination. However, the judge asked a number  of  questions  by
    way of clarification at [18] including whether there were any documents
    to show that the loss had been reported to the Royal  Mail.  It  turned
    out that one of the letters relied on (at A47) was unconnected with the
    appeal and was irrelevant. The judge did not make an express finding on
    the credibility of the appellant and the sponsor's oral  evidence,  but
    he has fully set out his concerns about the evidence  in  [21]-[22]  to
    explain why he found that the appellant had not discharged the onus  of
    showing  that  the  passports  had  been  lost  in  the   circumstances
    described.

19.   Whilst another judge might have reached a different  conclusion,  that
    does mean that the judge erred in his assessment of  this  issue.  When
    the evidence is looked at as a whole,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    judge's finding of fact on this issue can be categorized as  irrational
    or not properly open to him on the evidence.

20.    In  any  event,  the  judge  went  on  to  consider  matters  in  the
    alternative.  He said that even if he was satisfied that the  passports
    had been lost in the post as described, there was no  adequate  account
    for the delay between the rejection of the July  2016  application  and
    the eventual submission of the April 2017 application. It is  right  to
    note, as the judge did, that the respondent did not immediately  reject
    the July 2006 application but contacted the appellants  representatives
    to inform them that documents were missing and the subsequent  decision
    letter of 3  October  2016  indicates  that  the  respondent  gave  the
    appellant a further month to rectify the defects.  There is no evidence
    that the respondent was kept up-to-date with what  was  happening  and,
    even  on  the  appellant's  account,  they  received  the   replacement
    passports in late January/early February 2017,  but  their  application
    was not submitted until April 2017.   The  evidence  at  A22  that  the
    appellant's representative was unwell does  not  provide  any  adequate
    basis for a satisfactory explanation for the  delay.   It  is  dated  9
    February 2017 and simply refers to not being able to attend court.

21.   The issue in the second ground relates to whether  the  appellant  was
    able to meet the financial requirements of  the  Rules.   There  is  no
    doubt that the correct date for assessing matters under  article  8  is
    the date of hearing.  The judge was fully entitled to look at that date
    to see whether the requirements of the Rules were met. The reasons  the
    judge gave for finding that this was problematic as  set  out  in  [28]
    relating to the sponsor's most recent P60 and the evidence of  variable
    income in the period March April and May 2018  were  properly  open  to
    him.  I accept that if it was shown that the appellant could  meet  the
    income requirements in accordance with the Rules  as  at  the  date  of
    application that would be a relevant factor  as  part  of  the  overall
    factual matrix in assessing proportionality, but it  does  not  detract
    from the fact that article 8  must  be  assessed  as  at  the  date  of
    hearing.  For the reasons given by the judge, he was  entitled  not  to
    accept the submission that entry clearance was a virtual certainty  and
    to take the view that there was insufficient evidence to show that  the
    application was bound to be successful.

22.   The judge accepted that the first four tests in Razgar  were  met  and
    that  the  issue  was  whether  the  appellant's   removal   would   be
    proportionate.  He set out his reasoning on  both  sides  in  [33]  and
    [34].  This follows the guidance given by the Supreme Court in  Agyarko
    (2017) UKSC  11 and repeated by the Court of Appeal in TZ (Pakistan) in
    which the Court also confirmed that, when considering  the  application
    outside the Rules and in  undertaking  the  evaluation  of  exceptional
    circumstances, a Tribunal must  take  into  account  as  a  factor  the
    strength of the public policy on immigration control  as  reflected  by
    the respondent's tests within the Rules and  that  the  critical  issue
    would be whether the strength  of  the  public  policy  on  immigration
    control was outweighed by the strength of the article 8 claim such that
    there was a positive obligation on the state to permit the applicant to
    remain.  The Court also  emphasised  that  the  framework  approach  in
    Razgar was not to be taken as  avoiding  the  need  to  undertake  this
    critical balance.

23.   I am satisfied that the judge reached a decision properly open to  him
    on the issue of proportionality for the reasons he gave  in  [33]-[35].
    There were no insurmountable obstacles to the  appellant  returning  to
    Nigeria, whether with the sponsor or by herself to make an  application
    for entry clearance. It was argued that the application  was  bound  to
    succeed whereas, the judge, for reasons properly open to him, took  the
    view that it was not clear cut.  He  was  entitled  to  find  that  the
    strength of the public interest was not outweighed by the  strength  of
    the appellant's claim.

24.   In summary, I am satisfied that the judge reached a decision  properly
    open to him for the reasons he gave.  The grounds  do  not  satisfy  me
    that he erred in law.

Decision

25.   The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law and  it  follows  that  the
    decision to dismiss the appeal stands.
