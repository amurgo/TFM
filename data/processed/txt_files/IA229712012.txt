                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The appellant in  these  proceedings  is  the  Secretary  of  State.
       However, for convenience I refer to the parties as they were  before
       the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. Thus, the appellant is a citizen of the Philippines, born on 19  May
       1976. She arrived in the UK with leave as a  student.  She  made  an
       application for further leave to remain on 23 June 2012, within  the
       currency of her leave. That application was refused  in  a  decision
       dated 8 October 2012.

    3. Her appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge M. Hutchinson on 11
       December 2012 whereby she allowed the appeal under  the  Immigration
       Rules. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis of an  arguable
       error of law on the part of the First-tier judge in relation to  her
       appreciation of the requirements of the Rules.

    4. The application for further leave to remain was refused on the basis
       of  maintenance.  It  was  decided  that  the  appellant   had   not
       demonstrated that she had sufficient funds because  the  CAS  stated
       that of the course fees of ï¿½4,120, none had been paid. On the  basis
       that she had not paid the course  fees,  she  had  not  demonstrated
       sufficient funds in her accounts.

    5. The First-tier judge allowed the  appeal  because  on  the  evidence
       before her it was demonstrated that the appellant had in  fact  paid
       her course fees, and that this had been demonstrated at the time  of
       application. That she had paid  her  course  fees  was  conceded  on
       behalf of the respondent. Thus, the funds she had were sufficient to
       establish that she  was  entitled  to  the  claimed  10  points  for
       maintenance.

    6. It seems from the determination that the CAS that was used  was  one
       that related to the time when she started her course  in  2011,  but
       the appellant's case was that this  was  an  extension  of  stay  in
       relation to the existing course, rather  than  applying  for  a  new
       course. It appears that an issue arose as to whether  the  appellant
       had used the correct application form, although  before  the  First-
       tier Tribunal it was not established what application form was  more
       appropriate.

    7. The judge considered that she was not  able  to  take  into  account
       evidence that had not  been  submitted  with  the  application,  but
       (under the Rules at least)  her  conclusions  were  such  that  that
       evidence did not need to be taken into account.

    8. As a matter  of  interest,  it  is  also  to  be  noted  that  Judge
       Hutchinson dismissed  the  appeal  under  Article  8  of  the  ECHR,
       notwithstanding  that  she  had  allowed  the   appeal   under   the
       Immigration Rules (raising a question as  to  whether  it  could  be
       proportionate to the legitimate aim, to remove someone who has  been
       found to meet the requirements of  the  Rules).  I  also  note  that
       within the decision to refuse to vary leave to remain  there  was  a
       decision  to  remove  the  appellant  under  section   47   of   the
       Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006,  which  on  recent
       authority is a decision that is unlawful if made at the same time as
       a decision to refuse to vary leave to remain.

    9. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal on which  permission  to
       appeal was granted contended that the Immigration Rules at  Appendix
       C paragraph 13C required, in summary, evidence of the payment of the
       course fees to be stated on the CAS or on an original paper  receipt
       issued by the Tier 4 sponsor. That requirement of the Rules does not
       appear to have been drawn to the judge's attention by either  party,
       and not  surprisingly  therefore,  it  did  not  form  part  of  her
       consideration.

   10. At the hearing before me I raised with  the  parties  the  issue  of
       whether the relevant immigration rule that was relied on did in fact
       apply, given that although it was introduced into the  Rules  on  20
       July 2012, by the time the immigration decision was made, it was not
       part of the Rules at the date of application. The question arises as
       to whether there exists transitional  arrangements  in  relation  to
       applications made before that date. A second issue was  whether  the
       judge would in fact have been permitted to  consider  evidence  that
       was not submitted at the time of application in her consideration of
       Article 8, having regard to the human rights  exception  in  section
       85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.  A  third
       issue was the lawfulness of the removal decision under section 47, a
       matter that was not dealt with in the determination  of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal.

   11. At the hearing before me Mr Mullen indicated that he would  withdraw
       the section 47 removal decision. His submissions can  be  summarised
       as follows. He accepted that there appeared to  be  something  amiss
       with the CAS on its face. He suggested that it may be that  now  the
       principle of evidential flexibility would have been applied  to  the
       application.   The   appellant   probably   believes,   with    some
       justification, that she had what  she  needed  to  comply  with  the
       Rules. Although it was the appellant's responsibility to ensure that
       she put forward the correct evidence, it may be that the appropriate
       outcome is that the decision of the Secretary of  State  is  not  in
       accordance with the law and that the matter should go  back  to  the
       Secretary of State.

   12. I suggested to Mr Mullen that an alternative course would be for the
       Secretary of State to withdraw its case before the  Upper  Tribunal,
       that case being that the appellant is not entitled to  an  extension
       of stay. It was agreed that that was an appropriate course of action
       and it was understood by both parties that the effect of that  would
       be that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the  appeal
       under the Immigration Rules would stand.

   13. Rule 17 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
       provides as follows:
              "17.-(1) Subject to paragraph (2), a party may give notice  of
                 the withdrawal of its case, or any part of it -


              (a) at any time before a hearing to consider the  disposal  of
                     the proceedings (or, if the Upper Tribunal disposes of
                     the  proceedings  without  a  hearing,   before   that
                     disposal), by  sending  or  delivering  to  the  Upper
                     Tribunal a written notice of withdrawal; or


              (b) orally at a hearing.


             (2)   Notice of withdrawal will  not  take  effect  unless  the
                 Upper  Tribunal  consents  to  the  withdrawal  except   in
                 relation to an application for permission to appeal."

   14. I gave my consent to the withdrawal of the Secretary of State's case
       (that the appellant is not entitled to leave to remain). The  effect
       therefore, is that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to  allow
       the appeal under the Immigration Rules stands. The case for  removal
       under section 47 was also effectively withdrawn, it being a decision
       that is in any event unlawful.

   15. In the circumstances, the other issues raised  at  the  hearing  and
       identified in [10] above do not need to be resolved.

   16. The Secretary of State having withdrawn her case that the  appellant
       is not entitled to leave to remain, the  appellant  has  established
       that she should be granted further leave to remain. The decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeal  therefore  stands.  The
       appellant succeeds in her appeal against the decision to  refuse  to
       vary leave to remain.
