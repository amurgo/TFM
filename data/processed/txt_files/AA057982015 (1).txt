For the appellant:     Mr C Lane, instructed by Genesis Law Associates Ltd
For the respondent:    Mrs H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, [OF], date of birth [ ] 1974, is a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Fenoughty promulgated 28.7,15, dismissing on  all  grounds  his  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  18.3.15,  to
    refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims, and
    to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 14.7.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Davidge  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.8.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor granted permission to  appeal  on
    24.9.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 16.8.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal. For some unknown reason, the appeal was listed as a  'resumed
    hearing,' though as far as the parties and I could tell there  had  yet
    been no error of law finding in the matter. In the  circumstances,  the
    appeal proceeded as an error of law hearing only.  In  any  event,  the
    parties were not prepared to deal with the case for  a  rehearing.  The
    standard directions issued by the  Principle  Resident  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge provided for a hearing without oral evidence.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised briefly below, I found an error  of  law  in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    decision of Judge Fenoughty should  be  set  aside  to  be  remade,  by
    remittal to the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Taylor found it  arguable  that
    the judge did not apply  the  correct  test  in  relation  to  internal
    relocation, and may not have adequately dealt with what is said to be a
    large volume of evidence  in  relation  to  the  position  of  autistic
    children in Nigeria, which errors may have infected the article 8  ECHR
    conclusions.

 7. The Rule 24  response  submits  that  the  Judge  had  due  regard,  in
    assessing the risk  of  persecution  due  to  child's  autism,  to  the
    evidence in  the  respondent's  refusal  decision  and  the  additional
    evidence adduced at the hearing, demonstrating that there were a  large
    number of specialist schools and organisations in Nigeria. "The finding
    that the appellants would not suffer persecution, even if there  was  a
    degree of social ostracism, is wholly sustainable."

 8. It is also submitted in relation to article 8  that,  "the  Judge  gave
    cogent reasons  for  concluding  that  it  would  not  be  unreasonable
    primarily for the eldest, and only qualifying child, but also  for  the
    remaining minors to relocate  to  Nigeria  where  they  will  have  the
    support of their parents and will be able to access relevant  services.
    It is submitted that the grounds  are  merely  an  attempt  to  reargue
    issues which were fully considered by the Judge."

 9. Mr Lane submitted that at �44 the judge had applied an  incorrect  test
    for relocation, rather than applying the Januzi test of unreasonable or
    unduly harsh. However, it is clear  that  at  �44  the  judge  was  not
    assessing relocation, but the risk of  persecution  due  to  people  in
    Nigeria associating autism with witchcraft.  The  judge  accepted  that
    there may be a degree of social ostracism and discrimination, but  that
    the appellant had failed to show that the risk was sufficient,  on  the
    lower standard  of  proof,  that  the  appellant  would  be  unable  or
    unwilling to protect their son. The judge concluded  there  was  little
    risk of persecution due to autism. This conclusion is  supported  by  a
    further finding at �49 that the  appellant  had  not  established  that
    whilst the appellant may face some stigma as the parent of an  autistic
    child, this amounted to serious harm from which he would be  unable  to
    protect his son. �44 does not address relocation. That was addressed at
    �43, in relation to the risk from Boko Haram. There,  the  judge  found
    that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that the  risk  from  Boko
    Haram extended to all areas of the country that the family  could  live
    in, and that it was reasonable to expect the family to relocate  to  an
    area of Nigeria where the risk was low. In the circumstances, I am  not
    satisfied that this ground of appeal is made out, and in any  event  Mr
    Lane did not demonstrate to me evidence that relocation would be unduly
    harsh.

10. However,  the  asylum  and  humanitarian  protection  findings  in  the
    decision, relatively brief as they as are set out between �43 and  �45,
    and the proportionality  assessment  under  article  8  ECHR,  set  out
    between �48 and �53, fails, in  my  view,  to  adequately  address  the
    evidence as to the eldest child's autism. It is clear from the evidence
    in the respondent's bundle from D11 onwards that his degree  of  autism
    is severe and that he will need a high level of support. Mr  Lane  also
    pointed out from Q91  that  the  family's  relocation  from  London  to
    Birmingham was unable to take place because of the impact on the eldest
    son and his needs.

11. I find that the First-tier Tribunal's assessment of the eldest  child's
    needs and best interests, arising from his autism  was  inadequate.  At
    �52 the judge referenced the best interests of the child as  a  primary
    consideration, but one which could be outweighed by the accumulation of
    other factors. Much of such analysis as there was related to the  three
    children collectively, all of whom were born in the UK, and the judge's
    conclusion that their best interests were to remain with their  parents
    and that the best interests  of  being  able  to  avail  themselves  of
    educational and health facilities were "outweighed by the other factors
    in this case."

12. There was no adequate individual assessment of the eldest child's needs
    and best interests. More  significantly,  there  was  no  private  life
    assessment under paragraph 276ADE in relation to that  child,  who  met
    the 7 years' residence threshold requirement, as to whether it would be
    reasonable to expect that child to leave the UK. The similar test under
    section 117B(vi) provides that the public interest does not require  an
    applicant's removal where he has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with a qualifying child, where it  is  not  reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the UK. The judge  should  have  specifically
    assessed whether it would have been reasonable, given the  evidence  of
    his personal and individual circumstances,  to  expect  that  child  to
    leave the UK.

13. In her submissions, Ms Aboni accepted that the judge failed to  address
    paragraph 276ADE in relation to the  appellant  and  his  children,  in
    particular the eldest child who has  special  needs  arising  from  his
    autism. In error, the judge proceeded immediately to conduct  a  Razgar
    proportionality  assessment  under  article  8  ECHR,   without   first
    considering whether the appellant  or  any  of  his  children  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain. Further, the
    judge should only have gone on to the article 8 assessment outside  the
    Rules  if  it  was  found  that  there  were  compelling  circumstances
    inadequately recognised in the Rules  that  would  render  the  removal
    decision unjustifiably harsh. That assessment was  not  conducted.  For
    the reasons set out above, I also find that the  article  8  assessment
    was flawed, failing to inadequately address  section  117B(vi)  and  to
    apply anxious scrutiny to the needs and best interests  of  the  eldest
    child, if not those of the other children as well.

14. In all the circumstances, I find, for the reasons set  out  above,  the
    decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  inadequate,   incomplete   and
    ultimately in error of law.

15. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

16. In all the circumstances, this is a case which  falls  squarely  within
    the Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect
    of the error has been to deprive the appellant of a  fair  hearing  and
    that the nature or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find  that
    it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the appeal to be remade de novo  in  the  First-
                    tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable.
