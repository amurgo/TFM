                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1.  The  Appellants,  born  on  23rd  March  1986  and  25th   June   1987
    respectively, are both citizens of Pakistan and are married.  They made
    application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom based  on  family
    and private life.  That application was refused by  the  Respondent  on
    12th October 2016.  The Appellants appealed  that  decision  and  their
    appeals were heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Trevaskis
    sitting at Newport on 2nd October 2017.  The judge allowed their appeal
    outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules  on  human  rights  grounds.   The
    Respondent made application to appeal that  decision  on  11th  October
    2017.  Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Mailer on 19th March 2018.  He found it was arguable that the judge had
    erred in finding that there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to
    their integration in Pakistan thus affecting his  findings  under  both
    the Rules and under Article 8 outside of the Rules.

 2. Directions were issued for the Upper Tribunal first to consider whether
    or not an error of law had been made in this case.  That  hearing  took
    place on 15th August 2018 before Upper Tribunal Judge  Rimington.   The
    judge found that the factors  outlined  by  the  judge  as  potentially
    constituting a very significant  obstacle  to  their  reintegration  in
    Pakistan was a material error of law and set aside  the  decision  with
    directions that  there  should  be  a  resumed  hearing  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 3. The matter has now come before me in  accordance  with  those  findings
    made by Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington.

The Proceedings - Introduction

 4. As the Appellants were present I firstly outlined to them the nature of
    the proceedings and the way they would be conducted.   I  next  checked
    the documents available to me in this case.  Those documents consist of
    the original documents before the First-tier Tribunal.

The Proceedings - Evidence

 5. The first Appellant,  Mrs  Khan  was  called  to  give  evidence.   She
    provided her name, date of birth and address on  file.   She  confirmed
    that her witness statement was true and correct and adopted that as her
    examination-in-chief.

 6. In cross-examination she said that she had her parents and siblings  in
    Pakistan and she had nine  siblings.   She  was  in  contact  with  her
    parents.  Her husband has his mother in Pakistan and he was in  contact
    with her.  He also had brothers and sisters and  was  in  contact  with
    them.  She said that her husband's mother lived with his  siblings  and
    his father had died.  She confirmed that she  had  a  BSc  in  computer
    science from Pakistan and an MSc in mobile computing from the UK.   She
    said that her husband had similar BSc qualifications from Pakistan, and
    both worked in the IT/software industry in the UK.

 7. She said that when they came  to  the  UK  in  2014  as  students  they
    intended to return to Pakistan but that changed when  they  got  a  job
    offer in the UK.  She was only allowed to work twenty hours  per  week.
    She said that the Genie Lab had applied for a Tier 2 visa for her.  She
    said that she had gone earlier to a firm of solicitors and nothing  had
    happened.  In 2016 she said that she had informed the Home Office  that
    they intended to leave voluntarily for  Pakistan.   However,  she  said
    they had debts in  this  country  because  they  cannot  work  and  she
    believed those debts were now more than �8,000 and approaching �11,000.
     She provided a breakdown of where she believed those debts resided and
    her husband confirmed the same.  She said that their  daughter  was  17
    months of age and in good health.

 8. I next heard from the second Appellant, Mr Umair who provided his name.
     He said that he had read his wife's  witness  statement  and  accepted
    that and adopted it as his own evidence-in-chief.  In terms  of  making
    an application from Pakistan to come to the UK as a Tier 2  Migrant  he
    said that their immigration  history  is  such  that  because  of  this
    current problem he thought  it  would  be  difficult  for  them  to  be
    readmitted.  He said further the additional costs of living in Pakistan
    without employment and applying for a visa meant that  they  could  not
    afford such monies.  He said that  his  wife  was  also  now  currently
    thirteen weeks pregnant.

 9. In cross-examination he confirmed that he originally intended to return
    to Pakistan.  He accepted that they could get a job in Pakistan  within
    three months but the maximum income he could get would  be  about  �800
    per month and the rent of a property would take up  about  a  third  of
    that income.  He said that he had been working in Wales for  two  years
    when he was dependent on his wife's student visa and had earned �25,000
    per annum.  He had then relocated to  Cardiff  with  a  second  company
    where he had earned �22,000.

10. In closing submissions the Respondent relied upon  the  refusal  letter
    and it was submitted that there were no difficulties  in  return  under
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Rules or reasons to remain outside  of  the
    Rules under Article 8.  It was noted that  the  application  in  August
    2016 was an application outside of the Rules  under  Article  8  rather
    than an application for a Tier 2 visa.

11. In closing submissions on behalf of the  Appellants  it  was  submitted
    that they were both credible.  I  was  referred  to  their  immigration
    history  and  the  negligence  and  criminal  action  of  their  former
    solicitor documented within the bundle as being the  basis  for  why  a
    wrong application was  made  and  their  difficulties  began.   It  was
    further said that an  Entry  Clearance  Officer  would  look  at  their
    immigration history and potentially refuse any application to  come  to
    the UK on a Tier 2 visa or any other visa.

12. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision to consider the
    documents and evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with  my
    reasons.

Decision and Reasons

13. In this case the burden  of  proof  lies  on  the  Appellants  and  the
    standard of proof required for both immigration and human rights issues
    is a balance of probabilities.

14. I have carefully examined all of the evidence in this case.  I  do  not
    find that credibility is in  issue  in  this  case  and  I  accept  the
    evidence provided by  the  Appellants.   In  reality  there  is  little
    dispute on the facts in this case.

15. The Appellants present with an unusual case that  understandably  would
    lead to a sympathetic view being taken of their current position.   The
    Appellants are both highly qualified individuals and came to the UK  as
    students.  They formed an intent to remain in the  UK  as  it  provided
    potentially greater income and opportunity than similar work  in  their
    home country.  It is easy to envisage that in normal circumstances they
    may well have progressed from  holding  student  visas  to  potentially
    successfully obtaining other visas giving them status  and  ability  to
    obtain skilled employment at a  reasonable  rate  of  pay  in  the  UK.
    Regrettably they approached for advice and  assistance  a  disreputable
    firm of solicitors who did not provide proper advice and indeed  appear
    to have simply  taken  their  money  and  failed  to  make  any  proper
    application.  The conduct and  fate  of  these  solicitors  within  the
    criminal  courts  is  documented  within  the  paper  work  and   their
    culpability and the fact that the  Appellants  were  victims  of  their
    actions is beyond doubt.  That set of circumstances I accept and  place
    to one side for the moment.

16. The Appellants' application is to remain on the basis of  their  family
    and private life.  In accordance  with  such  appeals  I  have  firstly
    considered  whether  the  Appellants  come  within  the  terms  of  the
    Immigration Rules, as if they do, that is powerful evidence to indicate
    removal would be disproportionate.

17. In terms of the Immigration Rules the only  relevant  requirement  they
    may meet is under paragraph 276ADE(vi) in that based upon their private
    life  they  would  face  very  significant  obstacles   in   terms   of
    reintegration into life in Pakistan.  The  case  of  Treebhawon  [2017]
    UKUT 00013 has been referred to me as providing guidance on what  falls
    short of being very significant hurdles under paragraph 276ADE.

18. The reality is that neither Appellant would face any real obstacles  on
    return to Pakistan.  It is difficult to fashion a  cogent  argument  to
    the contrary.  Both Appellants  have  spent  most  of  their  lives  in
    Pakistan and were educated to degree level in that country.   They  are
    both in good health, and although there is reference to diabetes on the
    part of Mrs Khan, that is not so far as I can see put forward as  being
    at a debilitating stage, untreatable nor suggesting that any  treatment
    necessary is not available in Pakistan.  They  both  have  large  close
    families within their home country  with  whom  they  are  in  contact.
    Whilst long term it may be difficult for any family member individually
    to provide housing for them I find it most unlikely that short term  or
    in extremis they would not find shelter with a family  member.   It  is
    accepted that they would obtain employment within a short time  and  Mr
    Umair calculated he would earn about �800 monthly.   He  was  concerned
    that was insufficient to repay or reduce his UK debt and  concerned  he
    may spend  about  a  third  of  that  monthly  income  on  rent.   That
    percentage expended upon rent is not specific to Pakistan and there may
    be many people in the UK, particularly in places such  as  London,  who
    are familiar with paying such a percentage of their income on rent.   I
    fail to see the argument concerning the UK debt.  I accept  that  there
    is a debt.  Firstly, it presumes that that  UK  debt  will  necessarily
    follow the Appellants to Pakistan.  Secondly, at least in Pakistan they
    would be earning monies potentially preventing any such debt increasing
    whereas in the UK they are unable  to  work.   As  I  understand  it  a
    tranche of that current debt was as a result of the direct or  indirect
    culpability of their solicitors.   However,  more  than  half  of  that
    current debt has been accumulated by the Appellants continuing to  live
    in the UK with all the living expenses involved and at  the  same  time
    being unable to work.  Remaining in the UK in limbo and without  lawful
    authority and the ability to work seems the worst  option  to  take  in
    terms of debt clearance.

19. They have a very young child whose best interests are  totally  defined
    as being with the Appellants wherever they may be and the  recent  case
    of KO [2018] is appropriate in those circumstances.  The fact that  Mrs
    Khan is pregnant may suggest that being with her extended family in her
    home country with  settled  status  would  be  rather  better  for  her
    wellbeing in the next months rather  than  the  current  uncertain  and
    undoubted stressful state of affairs.

20. There is no significant obstacle to the Appellants  reintegrating  into
    Pakistan completely and in my view with ease.

21. Finding they do not come within the terms of the  Immigration  Rules  I
    have looked at circumstances generally to see whether they  demonstrate
    that their situation should be considered outside of the Rules applying
    the concept of proportionality within the final stage test of Razgar.

22. Firstly I find their UK debt, a feature upon which they relied heavily,
    is not such a circumstance.  I acknowledge the first  tranche  of  that
    debt is linked to the poor legal advice  they  received  and  therefore
    deal with that aspect in the context  of  that  advice.   However,  the
    greater part of that debt as I have indicated above has increased  over
    a period of time as a direct result of them remaining in the UK without
    status and the ability to work and earn money.

23. They are undoubtedly victims of unscrupulous and unpleasant individuals
    who were convicted by the  Crown  Court.   The  circumstances  of  that
    history does provide an unusual, even exceptional angle to  their  case
    that justifies looking at matters outside of  the  Rules.   As  I  have
    indicated above I have much sympathy with the Appellants'  plight.   It
    is also the case that they may well be potentially a valuable asset  to
    the UK in terms of their skills and willingness to work.  Certainly  on
    that basis alone they stand head and shoulders above many that are seen
    in these courts.

24. However, when examining Article 8 outside of the Rules and by necessity
    Section 117B of the 2002 Act, statute  reminds  us  that  adherence  to
    immigration policy is in the public interest and their failure to  meet
    the Immigration Rules is a feature.  Their command of English,  ability
    to work and integration means that they  do  not  attract  any  adverse
    factors under Section 117B(2) and (3).  I place far less reliance  upon
    (4) and (5) given the unusual history in this  case  but  I  do  remind
    myself that before their unfortunate meeting with  previous  solicitors
    they were only in the UK on temporary visas and therefore their  status
    has always been precarious.

25. The question is whether removal is disproportionate in respect of their
    family and private life. In terms of S55 Borders Act I  refer  to  [19]
    above. I do not find it interferes with their family life as they would
    leave together, have no family in the UK and all their family is within
    their home country.  In terms of private life it is  disruption  at  an
    acceptable level  that  is  the  question  rather  than  a  sympathetic
    acknowledgment of  bad  luck  or  a  generalised  assessment  of  their
    economic worth to the UK.  The latter in my view, if it does  anything,
    perhaps lowers the bar of public  interest  in  removal  but  does  not
    remove the bar totally when looking at all matters in the round.

26. I find when looking at all features  in  this  case,  placing  as  much
    weight as I can upon the unusual circumstances surrounding their former
    solicitors, that it simply  cannot  be  found  that  removal  would  be
    disproportionate in this case.  The Appellants  clearly  wish  to  gain
    employment in the UK.  A removal to Pakistan  does  not  preclude  that
    occurring in the future although I can understand their concern  as  to
    how they would be viewed by  an  Entry  Clearance  Officer.   There  is
    clearly mitigation to their circumstances.  They have produced and  are
    capable of producing cogent  documentary  evidence  relating  to  those
    unusual circumstances.  They would no doubt be able to  evidence  their
    potential value to the UK and their abilities to obtain  employment  as
    skilled migrants.  I would certainly hope that any  proper  application
    they made from Pakistan to come to the UK as skilled migrants would  be
    considered  fairly  and  sympathetically  because  if  they  meet   the
    necessary  criteria  it  would  seem  somewhat  unjust  to  hold  their
    particular circumstances against them in terms of the position of their
    recent immigration status.  However, the test that I have to  apply  at
    this stage, i.e.  the  question  of  proportionality  under  Article  8
    outside of the Rules, seems to me capable of only one answer as I  have
    indicated above that such removal would not be disproportionate in  all
    the circumstances of this case.
