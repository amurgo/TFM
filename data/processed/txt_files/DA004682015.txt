For the Respondent:    Ms Sophie Caseley, Counsel, instructed by BiD


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal brought by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department against a determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Traynor
    promulgated on 30 June 2016.

2.   The respondent to the appeal is Mr Sebastian Wojciech Janicki. He is  a
    Polish citizen born on 7 October 1969. He arrived in the United Kingdom
    in 2008 and has remained here ever since.

3.   On 30 June 2015, a Notice of Decision to make a Deportation  Order  was
    made ("the Decision"). The basis for  the  Deportation  Order  was  the
    commission of a number of criminal offences. The first in time, and  by
    far the most serious, was an offence of rape of  a  female  aged  under
    sixteen, committed in Poland. Mr Janicki pleaded not guilty but he  was
    convicted on 2 December 2002 and sentenced  to  a  five  year  term  of
    imprisonment.

4.   Mr Janicki committed further offences  following  his  arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom:


    i.   on 9 November 2009 before the Hampshire Justices he was  convicted
         of a drink driving offence and was fined �150 and made subject to a
         seventeen month disqualification.


    ii.  on 5 June 2014 he was convicted by the Sussex  Justices  of  three
         offences of failing to comply with the  provisions  of  an  Interim
         Notification Order which had been made on 14 April 2014 pursuant to
         the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The dates of  the  offences  were  29
         April 2014, 7 May 2014 and 14 May 2014. He was given a  conditional
         discharge, and ordered to pay costs of �85 and a  victim  surcharge
         of �15. A Notification Order was made for an indefinite period.


    iii. on 17 May 2016 (barely a month prior to  the  hearing  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal), he pleaded guilty to an offence of failing to
         comply with the Notification Order on a single occasion,  namely  2
         April 2016. He was made subject to a community order which  expires
         in  16  November  2016  and  carried  a   rehabilitation   activity
         requirement. A victim surcharge of �60 was imposed.

5.   The Decision stated that the Secretary of State was satisfied  that  Mr
    Janicki would pose a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
    to the interests of public policy. The Decision asserted that there was
    a real risk that Mr Janicki would re-offend; that he had not undertaken
    any rehabilitative work while in the United Kingdom; that there was  no
    evidence that he had addressed the underlying factors of  his  criminal
    behaviour, and that he posed a  continuing  risk  to  the  public.  The
    Secretary of State concluded that her decision to deport Mr Janicki was
    proportionate and in accordance with the principles of regulation 21(5)
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

6.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed Mr  Janicki's  appeal  under  the
    EEA Regulations and also under Article 8 of the European Convention  on
    Human Rights. Permission to appeal was granted on two  discrete  bases,
    and for convenience we address them separately.

     Ground One: Misdirection under the EEA Regulations

7.   Mr Melvin, representing the Secretary of State,  contended  that  Judge
    had misdirected himself by failing to take into  account  the  case  of
    SSHD v Dumliauskas & Others [2015] EWCA Civ 145  when  considering  the
    matter of rehabilitation. The judgment was cited by the Judge at  [56],
    together with the more recent decision of MC (Essa  principles  recast)
    Portugal  [2015]  UKUT  520  (IAC).  The   factual   circumstances   of
    Dumliauskas are at some distance from those of this appeal.  The  point
    of legal principle addressed at some  length  by  Sir  Stanley  Burnton
    (with whom Jackson and Floyd LJJ agreed) was whether regard  should  be
    had to  the  prospect  of  a  deported  person's  rehabilitation  being
    compromised by the absence of  support  facilities  in  the  offender's
    country of destination which would be available in his host country. In
    the related appeals issues of drug and alcohol  dependency  and  mental
    health were variously in play, none of which is engaged in this case.

8.    The  relative  availability  of  support  structures  as  an  aid   to
    rehabilitation only become relevant on the question of proportionality.
    In this case, the Judge's  clear  antecedent  findings  under  the  EEA
    Regulations were sufficient to be dispositive  of  the  appeal  without
    engaging proportionality. The  Judge  records  [50]  the  Secretary  of
    State's concession that Mr Janicki has a permanent right  of  residence
    and accordingly it was for the Secretary of  State  to  prove  that  he
    poses a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one
    of the fundamental interests of society to  the  threshold  of  serious
    grounds. The Judge found [65] that the  Secretary  of  State  'had  not
    established that the threshold of serious grounds of public  policy  or
    public security have been met'.

9.   We reject Mr Melvin's contention that this finding  is  susceptible  to
    being impugned. On the contrary, the Judge set out the  applicable  law
    and reached a careful and reasoned conclusion by balancing all relevant
    considerations  [58-66].  The  Judge  did  not  seek  to  minimise  the
    seriousness of the rape offence.  He also noted that Mr  Janicki  still
    does not accept his guilt. However, he was entitled to have  regard  to
    the fact that  the offence occurred in 2002,  Mr  Janicki's  subsequent
    re-offending was not of a similar nature and was comparatively minor in
    nature. The Judge recognises that Mr  Janicki  has  not  committed  any
    further motoring offences since his drink driving  conviction  in  2009
    which Mr Janicki had admitted was a 'stupid act' [66].

10.  The Judge's conclusion that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  failed  to
    discharge the burden of  proving  that  Mr  Janicki  posed  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat was clearly open to him on  the
    evidence before him and we  can  find  no  material  error  of  law  in
    relation to it.

     Ground two: Article 8

11.  It is  unclear  why  the  Judge,  having  made  clear  and  sustainable
    findings under the EEA Regulations, proceeded also to consider issue of
    Article 8, save that  it  formed  part  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    Decision. It does not appear  to  have  been  raised  in  Mr  Janicki's
    grounds of appeal, albeit at the time he did not have  the  benefit  of
    legal representation and the grounds are not well drafted.  Ms  Caseley
    very fairly conceded that Mr Janicki's  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not proceed on the basis of an alleged breach of Article 8
    ECHR.

12.  The Judge, in a brief make-weight paragraph [68] deals with  Article  8
    in a cursory manner by reading  across  proportionality  considerations
    which  might  have  been  relevant  under  the  EEA  Regulations.   The
    discussion of Article 8 is plainly inadequate. We find a material error
    of law and set aside this aspect of the Judge's decision. In  re-making
    the decision we dismiss Mr Janicki's appeal under Article 8 as  it  was
    not raised for determination within the appeal. This finding however is
    largely of academic interest in the light of  the  fact  that  we  have
    rejected ground one of the Secretary of State's appeal and we therefore
    uphold the Judge's decision which allowed  the  appeal  under  the  EEA
    Regulations.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision on Article 8 is set aside.  The  decision
is remade dismissing Mr Janicki's appeal on human rights grounds.

The Secretary of State's appeal under the EEA Regulations is  dismissed  and
the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal  under  the  EEA
Regulations is upheld
