For the Appellant:     Mr T Bahja, Counsel, instructed by Solomon
Solicitors

   1. The definition of "qualifying child" contained in section  117D(1)  of
      the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 does not  include  an
      EU citizen child resident in the United Kingdom for  less  than  seven
      years.


   2. The non-inclusion of EU citizen children resident for less than  seven
      years in the definition of "qualifying child" does not breach  the  EU
      law prohibition against discrimination on grounds of nationality.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This  appeal  concerns  whether  EU  law  requires  the  definition  of
    "qualifying child" in section 117D(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") to be applied as though it extends
    to children who are EU citizens, even if the child has not lived in the
    United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven years or more.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iran, born in  March  1998.   He  appeals
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox promulgated  on  30
    October 2019 dismissing his appeal against a decision of the respondent
    dated 18 July 2019 to refuse his asylum and human rights claim.   Judge
    Fox dismissed the protection element of the appeal,  finding  that  the
    claim had been fabricated.  There is no challenge to that finding.  The
    focus of this appeal is the Article 8 limb of the judge's decision.

 3. The appellant has a three year old Polish daughter with whom he is in a
    genuine and subsisting  relationship.   He  submits  that  the  judge's
    assessment of her best interests was flawed.  He also contends that  if
    his EU citizen daughter were British, she would engage section  117B(6)
    of the 2002 Act.  The public interest would not require the appellant's
    removal if it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the
    United Kingdom.  However, as the child is Polish and does not otherwise
    satisfy the "qualifying child"  criteria,  section  117B(6)  is  of  no
    application to the appellant.  The central issue  is  whether  that  is
    nationality discrimination contrary to EU law.

Factual background

 4. The judge accepted that the  appellant  enjoyed  family  life  for  the
    purposes of Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights
    ("ECHR") with his Polish partner and their daughter.  The appellant and
    his partner's relationship began in 2015.  They  are  not  married  but
    live together.  Their daughter was born in October 2016.

 5. The judge addressed the best interests of the daughter in these  terms,
    at [116]:

         "I now consider Article 8 in conjunction with section  55  [of  the
         Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  1999];  Zoumbas  [[2013]
         UKSC 74] applied. There is no dispute that family life exist  [sic]
         between the appellant, partner and child. However, for the  reasons
         stated above it is reasonable to  conclude  that  the  partner  has
         conspired  with  the  appellant  to  pursue  an  unmeritorious  and
         opportunistic asylum claim."

 6. The judge found that the appellant and his  partner  had  always  known
    that the  appellant's  immigration  status  was  precarious,  and  that
    separation was a possibility [117].  Pursuant to section  117B  of  the
    2002 Act, their family life attracted little weight,  the  judge  said.
    There was no suggestion that the child would be required to  leave  the
    United Kingdom if the appellant were removed: see [118].

 7. The judge found that the appellant  "cannot  satisfy  the  respondent's
    definition of Article 8  ECHR".   There  would  be  no  "insurmountable
    obstacles" [sic] to the appellant's removal to Iran [121].  There  were
    no exceptional circumstances such that the appellant's removal would be
    unjustifiably harsh.

 8. The judge considered that he did not enjoy the jurisdiction to consider
    whether the appellant could  succeed  on  any  other  basis  under  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  ("the  2016
    Regulations").  That would have been  a  "new  matter"  for  which  the
    respondent had not  provided  her  consent  ([125]).   The  judge  made
    findings on the point in any event.  There was no  "reliable"  evidence
    to demonstrate whether  the  appellant's  partner's  claimed  part-time
    employment at Pizza Hut was  genuine  and  effective  or  marginal  and
    ancillary: see [126].

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Mandalia  on
    the basis that the judge erred in assessing Article 8 in the context of
    the best interests of the partner's child.

Submissions

10. First, the grounds contend that the judge erred by holding against  the
    child the misconduct of the appellant  and  his  partner,  the  child's
    mother.

11. Secondly, the grounds contend that the judge was wrong not to treat the
    child as a "qualifying child" for the purposes of  section  117D(1)  of
    the  2002  Act.   This  is  because  Parliament's  exclusion   of   the
    appellant's daughter from the  definition  of  "qualifying  child"  was
    nationality-based discrimination in breach of Article 18 of the  Treaty
    on the Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU").  Further,  it  would
    not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.

12. Mr Bajha focused primarily on his second ground of appeal, relying upon
    Nouazli v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 16  at
    [51].   He  submits  that  nationality-based  discrimination  is   only
    permitted where it can  be  justified  objectively,  on  public  policy
    grounds, relying on Nicolas Bressol and Others and C�line Chaverot  and
    Others v Gouvernement de la Communaut� fran�aise Case  C-73/08.   There
    is no legitimate public interest to justify the difference in treatment
    between British citizen children under section 117D(1) and  EU  citizen
    children, he submits.  Accordingly, the judge failed properly  to  deal
    with the application and import of section 117B(6), as he was  required
    by EU law to do.  Mr Bajha accepts that this was  not  a  point  raised
    before the judge below, but submits that it was "Robinson obvious", and
    should have been considered by the judge of his own motion.

13. Mr Bramble submitted that the appellant had not  applied  to  have  his
    position as the father of an EEA national child  determined  under  the
    2016 Regulations.  In any  event,  he  submitted,  the  child  had  not
    started education, was under three at the time; there was no suggestion
    that her best interests were such as to override the  cumulative  force
    of the reasons in favour of removing the appellant.

The law

14. Article 18 of TFEU provides, where relevant:

         "Within the scope of  application  of  the  Treaties,  and  without
         prejudice  to  any  special  provisions  contained   therein,   any
         discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited."

15. Article 24(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of
    the Council dated 29 April 2004, on the right of citizens of the  Union
    and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory
    of the Member States provides:

         "Subject to such specific provisions as are expressly provided  for
         in the Treaty and secondary law, all Union citizens residing on the
         basis of this Directive in the territory of the host  Member  State
         shall enjoy equal treatment with the nationals of that Member State
         within the scope of the Treaty. The benefit of this right shall  be
         extended to family members who are not nationals of a Member  State
         and who have the right of residence or permanent residence."

16. Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act provides:

         "(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

17. The term "qualifying child" is defined  in  section  117D(1)  in  these
    terms:

         "'qualifying child' means a person who is under the age of  18  and
         who -

             (a) is a British citizen, or

             (b) has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of
             seven years or more..."

Discussion

Best interests of the child

18. A child must not be blamed for matters for  which  he  or  she  is  not
    responsible, such as the conduct of a parent: see Zoumbas  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74 at [10] per Lord Hodge.
     There must be a full consideration of all relevant factors.

19. The Court of Appeal developed the context for  any  assessment  of  the
    best interests of a child in EV (Philippines) v Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874 in these terms, at [58]:

         "...the assessment of the best interests of the  children  must  be
         made on the basis that the facts are as they are in the real world.
         If one parent has no right to remain, but the  other  parent  does,
         that is the background against which the assessment  is  conducted.
         If neither parent has  the  right  to  remain,  then  that  is  the
         background against which the  assessment  is  conducted.  Thus  the
         ultimate question will be: is it reasonable to expect the child  to
         follow the parent with  no  right  to  remain  to  the  country  of
         origin?"

      The "real world" context test was endorsed by the Supreme Court in  KO
    (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]  UKSC  53
    at [19].

20. I find that the  judge  failed  to  apply  the  above  principles  when
    addressing the best interests of the appellant's  daughter.   The  only
    operative analysis the judge engaged in concerning the  best  interests
    of the appellant's daughter was to  highlight  his  findings  that  the
    appellant and his partner had "conspired"  to  bring  an  unmeritorious
    asylum claim: see [116], quoted at paragraph  5,  above.   The  adverse
    findings made by the judge against the appellant and his  partner  were
    of no relevance  to  his  assessment  of  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant's daughter.  Yet he appeared to hold the parents'  misconduct
    against the daughter.  Nor did he address  the  "real  world"  context.
    These were errors of law.

21. I must address the second ground of appeal to determine the materiality
    of the above errors.

The definition of "qualifying child" and EU citizen children

22. Mr Bahja is correct to highlight the fact that section 117B(6)  of  the
    2002 Act is not engaged by an EU citizen child in the same way as it is
    by a British citizen child.  A British citizen child is  a  "qualifying
    child" automatically.  By contrast, an EU citizen child (like any other
    non-British child) will only be  a  "qualifying  child"  if  they  have
    resided here for a continuous period of seven years or more.

23. I should note that Mr Bahja did not submit that the distinction between
    EU  and  British  children  contravenes   other   international   legal
    obligations of the United Kingdom (for example,  Article  14  ECHR)  or
    domestic anti-discrimination law, such as the Equality Act  2010.   The
    sole focus of his case was that section 117B(6) contravenes Article  18
    TFEU.

24. Mr Bahja contends that section 117B(6) must be "read down"  to  include
    EU citizen children, to avoid direct, nationality-based  discrimination
    in contravention of EU law.

25. Two preliminary observations are necessary.

26. First, the submission was not raised before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    It will not usually be an error of law for the First-tier Tribunal  not
    to address a submission it was not invited to consider.  See  Hickey  v
    Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2018] EWCA Civ 851  at  [52],
    per Coulson LJ.

27. The submission is not, as Mr Bahja contends, "Robinson obvious".  If it
    had been, it would have been an error of the judge not to consider  the
    point, even though the parties had not raised it.   "Robinson  obvious"
    has its origins in R v Secretary of State for The Home  Department,  Ex
    parte Robinson [1998] Q.B.  929,  referring  to  the  obligation  on  a
    tribunal to consider an "obvious" point of refugee law not raised by an
    appellant.  At 946, Lord Woolf MR said, "[w]hen we refer to an  obvious
    point we mean a point which has a strong prospect of success if  it  is
    argued."

28. The high threshold for a Robinson-obvious point was underlined recently
    in AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA practice) Iran [2018]  UKUT  245
    (IAC) at [61]  to  [74],  and  in  Durueke  (PTA:  AZ  applied,  proper
    approach) [2019] UKUT 197 (IAC).

29. The appellant's submissions in the  present  matter  are  in  different
    territory.  It is not "obvious"  that  the  definition  of  "qualifying
    child" should be read so as to encompass an EU citizen  child  resident
    for fewer than seven years.   For  the  reasons  set  out  below,  that
    submission is without merit.

30. Secondly, the jurisdiction of the First-tier Tribunal was, in  relation
    to the Article 8 limb of the case, to  consider  whether  the  decision
    would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998: see the
    ground of appeal contained in section 84(1)(c) of  the  2002  Act.   By
    contrast, the primary thrust of  Mr  Bahja's  submission  is  that  the
    approach taken by Parliament in section 117D(1) of  the  2002  Act  was
    such that the EU law rights of the appellant's daughter were  breached.
    That is an entirely different argument, advanced pursuant to a separate
    legal framework that sits within a different international legal  order
    (the EU Treaties, rather than the European Convention on Human Rights),
    relating primarily to the EU law rights enjoyed not by  the  appellant,
    but by his daughter.

31. While it is possible to raise, within the confines of an appeal  before
    the First-tier Tribunal under the 2002 Act, a point of  law  concerning
    the EU Treaties, that process was not followed before the judge  below.
    An appellant may raise an EU law point in response to a  notice  served
    under section 120 of the 2002 Act, or  as  a  "new  matter",  with  the
    consent of the Secretary of  State:  see  Schedule  2(2)  to  the  2016
    Regulations and Oksuzoglu (EEA appeal - "new matter") [2018]  UKUT  385
    (IAC).

32. Given the appellant did not seek to raise the novel  EU  law  point  on
    which he now relies previously, either in response to the Secretary  of
    State's notice issued to him under section 120 of the 2002  Act  on  15
    January 2015, or as a "new matter" before the First-tier  Tribunal,  it
    follows  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  lacked  the  jurisdiction  to
    consider whether the EU  ground  of  appeal  now  relied  upon  by  the
    appellant was made out.  The prospect of the appellant enjoying a right
    to reside on an unspecified EU  law  basis  was  canvassed  before  the
    judge, but he  lacked  the  jurisdiction  to  consider  it.   The  same
    restriction is not engaged in the Upper Tribunal, as a  superior  court
    of record: see Birch (Precariousness and mistake; new  matters)  [2020]
    UKUT 86 (IAC).

33.  It  follows  that  the  judge's  purported  findings  concerning   the
    appellant's partner's work and whether she  was  a  "qualified  person"
    under regulation  6  of  the  2016  Regulations  were  reached  without
    jurisdiction.  That was an error of law.

Nationality discrimination under EU law

34. Turning to the substantive submission under the second  ground,  it  is
    necessary to recall that the appellant is not an  EU  citizen.   He  is
    Iranian.  The rights conferred by  the  EU  Treaties  on  EU  citizens,
    including  the  protection  against  nationality-based   discrimination
    enjoyed by EU citizens under Article  18  TFEU  and  Article  24(1)  of
    Directive 2004/38/EC are not  conferred  upon,  or  enjoyed  by,  third
    country nationals who are outside the scope of EU law.

35. Although the appellant relies on Nouazli in order to  substantiate  his
    claim of discrimination, it is of no assistance.  The issue in  Nouazli
    was whether Mr Nouazli, an  Algerian  citizen  with  EU  free  movement
    rights in the United Kingdom acquired by marriage to his  French  wife,
    suffered discrimination contrary to Article 18 TFEU on account  of  his
    detention under the Immigration (European  Economic  Area  Regulations)
    2006 in circumstances where no equivalent power of detention would have
    been available had he been a  person  subject  to  immigration  control
    under the Immigration Act 1971.  The power in question was to detain on
    an anticipatory basis, pending a full deportation decision being taken.
     There was no power of so-called  "anticipatory  detention"  under  the
    1971 Act for third country nationals subject  to  immigration  control.
    Mr Nouazli argued that he was subject to  a  more  draconian  detention
    regime as a result of his  EU  law  rights  than  other  third  country
    nationals subject  to  immigration  control  would  face,  contrary  to
    Article 18 TFEU.

36. The Supreme Court held that Article 18 TFEU  was  only  concerned  with
    discrimination between EU citizens and  citizens  of  the  host  Member
    State.  The EU law prohibition against nationality-based discrimination
    did not apply in relation to rights enjoyed by  EU  citizens  (and,  by
    extension under Article 24(1)  of  Directive  2004/38/EC,  their  third
    country family members residing under the directive) when compared with
    those wholly outside the EU regime.  At [43], Lord Clarke noted that in
    Vatsouras v Arbeitsgemeinschaft (AGRE) N�rnberg 900  (Joined  Cases  C-
    22/08 and C-23/08) [2009] All ER (EC) 747, the Court of Justice of  the
    European Union ("the CJEU") held at [52] that what is  now  Article  18
    TFEU:

         "concerns situations coming within the scope of  Community  law  in
         which  a  national  of  one  Member  State  suffers  discriminatory
         treatment in relation to nationals of another Member  State  solely
         on the basis of his nationality and is not  intended  to  apply  to
         cases of a possible difference in treatment  between  nationals  of
         Member States and nationals of non-member countries."

    Vatsouras concerned whether it was discriminatory for a Member State to
    confer social benefits on certain third country nationals but not on EU
    citizens residing there.  The case was not confined to its facts,  held
    Lord Clarke.  It was setting out  general  principles:  see  [43].   It
    remains good EU law; see, for example, Opinion 1/15 Re CETA  Investment
    Court System (Belgium and others) at [169], handed down by the CJEU  on
    30 April 2019.

37. Against that background, at [51], Lord Clarke highlighted  the  limited
    scope of Article 24(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC.  Lord Clarke said  that
    Article 24(1):

         "...makes clear that the relevant comparators for the  purposes  of
         the Directive are the nationals of the host member state  but  [it]
         does not include  and  is  not  concerned  with  discrimination  as
         regards third country nationals who fall entirely outside the scope
         of EU law."

38. Thus, it was not open to Mr Nouazli to seek to compare his liability to
    anticipatory detention with the absence of  a  corresponding  power  of
    detention for those subject to immigration control under the 1971  Act.
    Such persons were not relevant comparators for the purposes of EU anti-
    discrimination law; they were wholly  outside  the  scope  of  EU  law.
    Pursuant to the way the Advocate General  summarised  the  position  in
    Vatsouras at [AG66]:

           "[Article 18] TFEU seeks  to  eliminate  discrimination  between
           Community citizens and nationals of the host  member  state  but
           does not offer guidelines  for  eliminating  the  discrimination
           complained of by the referring court."

39. It follows that the issue at the heart of Nouazli's anti-discrimination
    claim is of no assistance to the appellant;  it  concerns  a  different
    form of alleged discrimination which, in the event, was held not to  be
    discrimination contrary to the EU Treaties at all.

40. The appellant's complaint must therefore be analysed on the basis  that
    he contends that it is his  Polish  daughter  who  suffers  nationality
    discrimination when compared to  the  hypothetical  British  qualifying
    child.  Put this way, submits Mr Bahja, the daughter is potentially  at
    risk of her father being removed, even if it would  not  be  reasonable
    for her to leave the country, in circumstances in which the removal  of
    a person in a genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
    British citizen child would be regarded as  not  being  in  the  public
    interest, if it were not reasonable to expect the child to leave.

41. For the reasons set out below, this submission is without merit.

Discrimination on grounds of nationality: scope of EU law?

42. The EU law prohibition against nationality discrimination  arises  only
    in relation to situations that are within the scope of EU law.  So much
    is clear from Article 18 TFEU itself: "Within the scope of  application
    of the Treaties... any discrimination on grounds of  nationality  shall
    be prohibited" (emphasis added).

43. Article 24(1) of  Directive  2004/38/EC  gives  expression  to  the  EU
    prohibition against nationality-based discrimination  in  the  specific
    context of the free  movement  of  persons.   It  provides  that  Union
    citizens and their "family members" residing in the host  Member  State
    pursuant to  the  residence  rights  it  confers,  "shall  enjoy  equal
    treatment with the nationals of that Member State within the  scope  of
    the  Treaty".   The  emphasis  added  demonstrates  the  scope  of  the
    principle, which is limited to those areas covered by the EU  Treaties,
    reflecting the delineation of competences between EU Member States  and
    the EU.   The context for the above provision is  provided  by  Recital
    (20) to the Directive, again with emphasis added:

         "In accordance with the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of
         nationality, all Union citizens and their family  members  residing
         in a Member State on the basis of this Directive should  enjoy,  in
         that Member State, equal treatment with nationals in areas  covered
         by the Treaty, subject to such specific provisions as are expressly
         provided for in the Treaty and secondary law."

44. In the free movement of persons context, the CJEU  has  underlined  the
    limitation of EU rules in this area to situations within the  scope  of
    EU law.  The court noted in McCarthy v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department Case C-434/09 at [45] that:

         "...it is settled case law that the Treaty rules governing  freedom
         of movement for persons and the measures adopted to implement  them
         cannot be applied to situations which have no factor  linking  them
         with any of the  situations  governed  by  EU  law  and  which  are
         confined in all relevant respects  within  a  single  Member  State
         (see, to that effect, Government of the French Community v Flemish
         Government (C-216/06) [2008] E.C.R. I-1683; [2008] 2 C.M.L.R. 31 at
         [33], and Metock [2008] 3 C.M.L.R. 39 at [77])."

45. The primary question  for  consideration,  therefore,  is  whether  the
    appellant's daughter's relationship with him is  a  situation  that  is
    "within the scope" of the EU Treaties?  Or, by contrast, is  there  "no
    factor" linking the appellant's relationship with his daughter "to  any
    of the situations governed by EU law"  meaning  that  it  is  "confined
    [from the EU law perspective] in all relevant respects within a  single
    Member State"?  The term  the  CJEU  often  uses  to  describe  such  a
    scenario is a "wholly internal  situation"  (see,  for  example,  KA  v
    Belgium Case C-82/16 and the authorities cited at [30]).

46. The appellant's daughter's residence will, at all material times,  have
    been governed by Directive 2004/38/EC and the EU Treaties.    Directive
    2004/38/EC does not classify the appellant as a "family member" of  his
    daughter.  Although ordinarily a broad  term,  "family  member"  has  a
    limited scope as defined by the directive.  Article  2(2)  defines  the
    term "family member" to include spouses,  registered  partners,  direct
    descendants under the age of 21, and dependent direct relatives in  the
    ascending line.  The appellant is not, under that definition, a "family
    member" of his daughter, and his relationship with her is  not  "within
    the scope of the Treaties" on that basis.

47. The appellant has not been recognised by the Secretary of  State  as  a
    "durable partner" of his Polish partner, under  Article  3(2)(b).   Nor
    was he married to his partner or in a registered  partnership,  meaning
    he cannot be a "family  member"  on  that  account.   Accordingly,  the
    appellant's family life situation is not within the scope of  Directive
    2004/38/EC, and cannot be within the scope  of  the  Treaties  on  that
    basis.

48. There are, of course, situations when  a  third  country  national  may
    enjoy a right to reside conferred directly by the EU Treaties, in order
    to ensure an EU citizen is  not  deprived  of  the  benefits  of  Union
    citizenship: see the doctrine established  by  Zambrano  Case  C-34/09.
    The underlying rationale was described as  the  "effective  citizenship
    principle" by Lady  Justice  Arden  (as  she  then  was)  in  Sanneh  v
    Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2015] EWCA Civ 49 at [4].  At
    [5], she said:

         "The effective citizenship principle means that member  states  may
         not indirectly remove the benefits of a person's status  as  an  EU
         citizen."

49.  Chavez-Vilchez  and  others  v  Raad  van  bestuur  van   de   Sociale
    verzekeringsbank and others Case C-133/15 was  a  continuation  of  the
    Zambrano line of authority.  The CJEU confirmed that the  residence  of
    third country nationals falls  within  the  competence  of  the  Member
    States, save for those situations  where  a  third  country  national's
    continued presence is necessary to secure the  continued  enjoyment  of
    Union citizenship rights of  an  EU  citizen.   The  court  held,  with
    emphasis added:

         "63.  In this connection, the court has already held that there are
         very specific situations in which...  a  right  of  residence  must
         nevertheless be granted to a third-country national who is a family
         member of that Union citizen,  since  the  effectiveness  of  Union
         citizenship would otherwise be undermined, if, as a consequence  of
         refusal of such a right, that citizen would be obliged in  practice
         to leave the territory of the  European  Union  as  a  whole,  thus
         depriving him of the genuine enjoyment  of  the  substance  of  the
         rights conferred by that status: Ruiz Zambrano's case, paras 43-44;
         Dereci's case, paras 66-67; Rend�n Mar�n's case, para 74  and  S  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department, para 29.

         64.  The situations referred to in the preceding paragraph have the
         common feature that, although  they  are  governed  by  legislation
         which falls, a priori, within the competence of the member  states,
         namely legislation on the right of entry and  residence  of  third-
         country nationals outside the scope of provisions of  EU  secondary
         legislation, which provide for the grant  of  such  a  right  under
         certain  conditions,  those  situations  none  the  less  have   an
         intrinsic connection with the freedom of movement and residence  of
         a Union citizen, which precludes the right of entry  and  residence
         from being refused to  those  nationals  in  the  member  state  of
         residence of that citizen, in order to avoid interference with that
         freedom: Rend�n Mar�n's case, para 75 and S v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department, para 30 and the case law cited."

50. Two propositions are clear from the above extract.

51. First, residence rights of third country nationals outside the scope of
    EU secondary legislation (for example, Directive 2004/38/EC) ordinarily
    fall within the competence of the Member States and therefore will  not
    be within the scope of the Treaties.  As a consequence,  Member  States
    are free to enact domestic legislation in such areas, provided in doing
    so they have regard to situations covered by EU law  upon  which  there
    may be an impact (see Rottman  v  Freistaat  Bayern  Case  C-135/08  at
    [41]).

52. Secondly, it is only where a national measure would have the effect  of
    depriving a Union citizen of the genuine enjoyment of the substance  of
    the rights concerned by the virtue of their  status  that  a  right  to
    reside must be conferred on the  third  country  national.   The  third
    country national's continued presence in the host Member State must  be
    required to avoid an interference  with  the  substance  of  the  Union
    citizenship rights of the EU citizen in question.  Rights to reside  on
    this basis are often termed "derivative" rights, as the  third  country
    national's right to reside derives from that of a  Union  citizen.   In
    the case  of  minors,  the  assessment  of  the  required  presence  of
    dependency must be based on an assessment of the best interests of  the
    child, including the child's age, physical and  emotional  development,
    the emotional ties to each parent, and the risks which separation  from
    the third  country  national  parent  might  entail  for  that  child's
    equilibrium.  See the third unnumbered bullet point of paragraph [2] of
    the operative part of the judgment of the CJEU  in  KA  v  Belgium,  as
    applied by the Supreme Court in Patel v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2019] UKSC 59 at [28] to [30], drawing on Chavez-Vilchez at
    [71].

53. Applying the above considerations to the present matter, I recall  that
    the appellant is a third country national with no leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom.  He  is  not  a  "family  member"  under  Directive
    2004/38/EC.  The mere fact that  the  appellant's  daughter  is  an  EU
    citizen who may be residing in the United Kingdom on the  basis  of  EU
    law is not a sufficient nexus with EU law to extend to bring the family
    life situation of the appellant within the scope of the Treaties, given
    the non-inclusion of the appellant as a "family member" of his daughter
    in Directive 2004/38/EC, and the fact that his continued residence  has
    not been recognised on a derivative rights basis.   Mr  Bahja  did  not
    take me to any EU legislation concerning family  unification  or  third
    country residence rights in relation to which the  United  Kingdom  has
    exercised its ability to opt-in,  or  that  otherwise  applies  to  the
    United Kingdom, which is engaged in relation  to  the  appellant.   The
    appellant's  family  life  with  his  daughter  is  a  wholly  internal
    situation.

54. The fact that (an entirely separate) EU avenue is potentially  open  to
    the appellant highlights the futility of his nationality discrimination
    submissions and underlines the difficulties inherent in  comparing  the
    EU residence regime to the domestic immigration control equivalent.

55. If the appellant is successful in gaining recognition of any claimed EU
    law-based derivative right to reside, that will  of  course  bring  his
    situation "within the scope of the Treaties", potentially removing  the
    barrier he  currently  faces  to  relying  on  his  daughter's  claimed
    discrimination contrary to Article 18 TFEU.  However, by definition, if
    such a derivative  (or  other)  right  to  reside  is  recognised,  his
    daughter will not face a discriminatory situation when compared with  a
    hypothetical  British  qualifying  child.    The   discrimination   the
    appellant  complains  that  his  daughter  currently  faces  will  have
    vanished.  The appellant  would  enjoy  a  right  to  reside,  and  his
    daughter would be able to enjoy his continued presence in this country.



56. In those circumstances, far from experiencing less favourable treatment
    than  the  hypothetical  British  qualifying  child,  the   appellant's
    daughter would enjoy more  favourable  treatment.   The  engagement  of
    section 117B(6) only arises where  a  person  faces  possible  removal,
    which would not be a risk for her father,  who  would  have  secured  a
    right to reside.  The hypothetical British child who enjoys the benefit
    of section 117B(6) merely enjoys the ability for their parent not to be
    removed if it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the
    United Kingdom.  By contrast,  no  such  reasonableness  considerations
    would arise under EU law once the appellant had secured recognition  of
    a derivative right to reside.

57. By contrast, if the appellant is unsuccessful in  securing  recognition
    of a derivative or other EU-based right to  reside,  it  would  confirm
    that  his  situation  is  not  "within  the  scope  of  the  Treaties",
    preventing him from relying  on  his  daughter's  putative  nationality
    discrimination by proxy.  The position as at the date  of  the  hearing
    below, of course, was that the appellant  had  not  even  attempted  to
    secure recognition of any form of derivative right  to  reside  through
    his daughter, and jurisdictionally it was not the role of the judge  to
    consider the issue.

58. Accordingly, whether the appellant is  successful  or  unsuccessful  in
    gaining recognition of any claimed derivative right to reside, the fact
    that EU law makes provision for him to attempt to  do  so  demonstrates
    that the discrimination he claims his daughter faces in  breach  of  EU
    law is incapable of being established within the confines of this human
    rights appeal.

59. It follows that the difference in the application of section 117B(6) to
    the appellant's Polish daughter and a hypothetical  British  qualifying
    child is  not  within  the  scope  of  the  Treaties,  and,  therefore,
    incapable of amounting to nationality  discrimination  contrary  to  EU
    law.  This is fatal to Mr Bahja's submission.  Accordingly,  the  judge
    did not fall into error through his non-application of section  117B(6)
    to the Article 8 ECHR proportionality assessment.

Postscript: Bressol

60. Mr  Bahja's  reliance  on  Bressol  is  misplaced.   Bressol  concerned
    indirect discrimination on grounds of nationality, and the need for  an
    objective justification for that form of discrimination.  By  contrast,
    the  appellant  submits  that  his  daughter  is  a  victim  of  direct
    discrimination, which can never be justified.  Although  Mr  Bahja  did
    not  pursue  a  fall-back   indirect   discrimination   argument,   the
    prohibition is only engaged in relation to comparator  situations  that
    are within the scope  of  the  Treaties.   There  can  be  no  indirect
    discrimination within the scope of the Treaties here, for  the  reasons
    set out above.

Application to the present matter

61. The decision of Judge Fox involved the making of an  error  of  law  in
    assessing  the  appellant's  daughter's  best  interests  and  reaching
    findings beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction on whether his partner  was
    a "qualified  person".   I  set  aside  his  decision,  preserving  his
    unchallenged asylum and related findings of fact, and the  findings  of
    fact which went to the Article 8 analysis.  I will remake the  decision
    insofar as it relates to the best interests of the appellant's daughter
    and the proportionality of the appellant's removal under Article 8.

62. The central issue  is  whether  it  would  be  proportionate,  for  the
    purposes of Article  8(2)  ECHR,  for  the  appellant  to  be  removed,
    treating the best interests of his daughter as a primary consideration.

63. The "real world" context of the appellant's family  unit  is  that  his
    partner and daughter are Polish.  Mother and daughter  do  not  require
    leave to remain and  claim  to  enjoy  a  right  to  reside  under  the
    relatively favourable regime established by the 2016 Regulations.  Both
    will be eligible to apply for pre-settled or settled status  under  the
    EU Settlement  Scheme,  subject  to  a  detailed  assessment  of  their
    circumstances.  The appellant is Iranian; relocation of the family unit
    to Iran is likely to present considerable difficulties; the  judge  did
    not countenance the possibility of the family unit relocating to  Iran,
    and there is nothing to suggest that it would be possible.  Mr  Bramble
    did not suggest relocation to Iran would be reasonable.  The judge  did
    find that the  couple  were  free  to  explore  relocation  to  Poland,
    pursuant to the domestic arrangements there for the appellant's partner
    to sponsor his residence.  The appellant's daughter is now three  years
    old.  The judge found that  she  speaks  English  and  Polish,  and  is
    involved in the Catholic faith, albeit in a limited manner (see [118]).
     No safeguarding concerns have been presented.  The "ultimate question"
    of whether it is reasonable to expect the  child  to  relocate  to  the
    "country of  origin"  (EV  (Philippines)  at  [58])),  in  the  current
    context, is whether it is reasonable to expect the child to follow  the
    appellant to Iran.  Plainly it would not be. The child's best interests
    are to remain living with  the  family  unit,  whether  in  the  United
    Kingdom or Poland.

64. Factors in favour of the removal of the appellant include:

        a. The public interest in the maintenance of effective  immigration
           controls (section 117B(1));

        b. The appellant does not meet any requirements of the  Immigration
           Rules;

        c. The appellant's English is limited; he gave evidence before  the
           First-tier Tribunal in Kurdish Sorani (section 117B(2));

        d. The appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully  and  has
           never held leave to remain;

        e. Little weight should be given to the  appellant's  private  life
           and his relationship with his partner, as it was established  at
           a time when the appellant's immigration status was unlawful.

65. Factors mitigating against removal include:

        a. The appellant's removal would not be consistent  with  the  best
           interests of the appellant's daughter, which are to remain  here
           or to move to Poland, her country of  nationality.   This  is  a
           primary consideration;

        b. The appellant enjoys family life with  his  Polish  partner  and
           daughter;

        c. The appellant has worked as a barber in the past and there is no
           evidence that he has claimed any benefits and is  not  otherwise
           financially independent (the judge noted that the appellant  did
           not know whether his partner claimed housing benefit but made no
           positive findings on the point).  He wants to continue  to  work
           in the future;

        d. The appellant has established a private life  in  this  country,
           since his clandestine arrival in January 2015.

66. I consider the factors in favour of the removal  of  the  appellant  to
    outweigh  those  mitigating  against  his  removal.   While  the   best
    interests of his daughter are for the family unit to remain intact  and
    are not consistent with her returning to Iran with  him,  or  remaining
    here in the absence of the appellant,  the  cumulative  weight  of  the
    factors in favour of the appellant's removal are capable of outweighing
    her best interests.  Even treating his daughter's best interests  as  a
    primary consideration does not  have  the  effect  of  outweighing  the
    combined force of the factors in favour  of  the  appellant's  removal.
    The daughter falls within a  category  of  children  resident  in  this
    country in relation  to  which  Parliament  has  legitimately  drawn  a
    distinction from British citizens, and she does not enjoy  the  benefit
    of  section  117B(6).   The  public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of
    immigration control is a weighty factor.  This  appellant  entered  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully, sought to pursue a fabricated asylum  claim,
    and has resided here unlawfully ever  since.  This  decision  does  not
    necessarily lead to permanent separation of the family unit;  there  is
    no evidence that the appellant and his partner would  not  be  able  to
    relocate to  Poland.   The  removal  of  the  appellant  would  not  be
    disproportionate for the purposes of Article 8(2) ECHR.

67. This appeal is dismissed.


Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge Fox involved the making of an error of law and is  set
aside.  His findings concerning the appellant's asylum claim are preserved.

I have remade the decision, dismissing it on Article 8 grounds.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
