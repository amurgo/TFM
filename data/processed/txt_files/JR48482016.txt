                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent



                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson


            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Ms K McCarthy of  Counsel,  instructed  by  S  K
Solicitors  on  behalf  of  the  Applicant  and  Mr  T  Fisher  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department on behalf of  the  Respondent,
at a hearing at Field House, London on 9 March 2017.

      Decision: the application for judicial review is granted

 1. The Applicant, a Citizen of Pakistan born on 23 March  1967,  has  been
    granted permission to apply for Judicial Review of the decision of  the
    Respondent dated 4 February  2016  to  refuse  his  application  of  23
    September 2015 for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom  as
    a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.  The  Respondent's  refusal  of  the
    application was maintained on administrative review on 14 March 2016.


 2. The Applicant's immigration  history  is  as  follows.   The  Applicant
    arrived in the  Untied  Kingdom  on  24  June  2012  with  valid  entry
    clearance as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  valid  to  25  September
    2015.  On 24 September 2015, the Applicant applied for indefinite leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  "accelerated
    settlement" route.  The Applicant's  wife  (Humaira  Saleem)  and  four
    children (Rai Muhammed Ibrahim Badar, Maria Ali,  Khadeeja  Haider  Roy
    and Ayesha) were granted entry clearance in line with the Applicant and
    continue to be dependent upon his application.


 3. The Respondent refused the application on the basis that the  Applicant
    could not be awarded the requisite number of points under  Table  6  of
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules as required by paragraph  245DF  of
    the same.   First,  the  Applicant  was  not  awarded  any  points  for
    investment because he did not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 46-
    SD(c) of Appendix A as  he  had  not  provided  documentation  from  HM
    Revenue  and  Customs  which  confirmed  that  his   business,   Gogara
    International  Limited,  was  registered  for   UK   Corporation   Tax.
    Secondly, the Applicant was not awarded any  points  for  job  creation
    because he had not provided all of the required specified documents  in
    paragraph 46-SD(h)(i) of Appendix A (the correct reference to paragraph
    46-SD(h)(ii) of Appendix A was made  on  administrative  review).   The
    Applicant had provided evidence in the form of  wage  slips,  RTI  full
    payment submissions and copies of identity documents for 17  employees,
    however this information did not show the start dates of the  employees
    and the evidence was not therefore accepted in the absence  of  P45  or
    P46 documentation.  In addition, the  Respondent  did  not  accept  the
    Applicant had demonstrated that he had created 10 full-time jobs, which
    had each lasted for a 12 month period.


 4. The Respondent made reference to paragraph 245AA(b) of the  Immigration
    Rules relating to evidential  flexibility,  but  did  not  apply  these
    provisions as in  the  present  case  there  was  a  missing  specified
    document which was not one which fell  within  a  series  of  documents
    provided.  The Respondent did not go on to carry out a full  assessment
    of all aspects of the requirements  for  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, although points were awarded
    for current registration  as  a  director  and  continuous  time  spent
    lawfully in the United Kingdom.


 5. The Applicant sought administrative review of the  decision  to  refuse
    his application.  In relation to the  first  reason  for  refusal,  the
    Applicant referred to a document submitted as part of  his  application
    dated 2 July 2012 which contained his corporation tax number as  issued
    by HM Revenue and Customs. It was  suggested  that  this  document  had
    simply been overlooked when his application was assessed.  In  relation
    to the second ground of refusal, on job creation, the Applicant  stated
    that he had provided the start and end dates of each employee by way of
    documents additional to the RTI Full Submission Payments  in  a  report
    from an Independent Chartered Accountant. The start and end dates  were
    also referred to in the Applicant's application form and in any  event,
    the Applicant considered that start and end dates were  only  mandatory
    under  the  rules  when  somebody  joined  an  existing   business   to
    demonstrate the creation of a net increase in employment (as opposed to
    where he had started the business).  Further, the Applicant stated that
    the rules which had been applied to  his  application  were  not  those
    applicable to him as he had entered Tier 1 prior to 6 April 2014,  such
    that he did not need to show the existence of  10  separate  jobs  each
    created and existing for at least 12 months.


 6. In her administrative review, the Respondent maintained the decision to
    refuse the Applicant's application for indefinite leave to remain.   It
    was maintained that the Applicant had not supplied  evidence  that  his
    company had been registered for corporation tax purposes  and  that  he
    was required to supply a P45 document showing start dates of employment
    of jobs created, which had not been complied with, as per paragraph 46-
    SD(h)(ii) of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  There was  no  other
    evidence of start dates.   Finally,  the  Respondent  stated  that  the
    transitional  arrangements  for  applicants  who  entered  the  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) route prior to  6  April  2014  do  not  apply  to  this
    Applicant who was applying under the accelerated route  for  indefinite
    leave to remain.


 7. The original grounds of challenge  in  this  application  for  Judicial
    Review were that the Respondent's decision was unlawful and unfair,  on
    the basis that she had failed to have regard to the evidence  submitted
    with the application and had not applied the correct Immigration  Rules
    to  the  application.   Permission  was  granted  at  a  renewed   oral
    permission hearing on 28 October 2016 by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul
    with directions  for  the  Applicant  to  reformulate  the  grounds  of
    challenge in a more focused and coherent manner.   That  direction  was
    duly complied with.


 8. At the substantive hearing, Counsel for the Applicant sought permission
    to amend the  grounds  of  challenge  further  on  the  basis  that  as
    currently formulated, they referred to the amended requirements of  the
    Immigration Rules which were not those applicable  to  the  Applicant's
    application and correspondingly, incorrect versions of the Respondent's
    policy guidance were also included.   Although  the  lateness  of  this
    application was a cause of concern, the Respondent did not object to it
    and one can have considerable sympathy with the Applicant and his legal
    team in the difficulties  experienced  with  trying  to  ascertain  the
    applicable rules and guidance for the application  and  decision  under
    challenge.  The Applicant's application was made at a  time  when  both
    the Immigration Rules and policy  guidance  were  being  amended  on  a
    frequent basis.  The Respondent had not been explicit in  the  decision
    letter, nor in the administrative review as to the precise requirements
    relevant to the application and in  fact  and  made  reference  to  two
    different versions of the same provision (incorrectly in  the  decision
    letter and correctly on  administrative  review)  as  well  as  placing
    reliance on  different  sub-paragraphs  within  the  Immigration  Rules
    between the two decisions.   Experienced  Counsel  on  both  sides  had
    difficulty identifying and obtaining copies of the  correct  documents.
    The application to amend the grounds was granted  to  ensure  that  the
    Respondent's decision was challenged on the correct basis and  a  short
    adjournment was given on the day so that the correct versions could  be
    obtained and agreed upon prior to the start of the substantive hearing.


 9. The three grounds of challenge in this application are as follows:


       i) that the  Respondent  acted  irrationally  and/or  unlawfully  in
          concluding  that  the  Applicant  had  not  submitted  sufficient
          evidence that his company was registered for corporation  tax  as
          required by paragraph  46-SD(c)(iii)(2)  of  Appendix  A  of  the
          Immigration Rules;


      ii) that the Respondent wrongly applied the requirements of paragraph
          46-SD(h)(ii) of Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration  Rules  to  the
          Applicant because these provisions were only for  those  required
          to show a 'net increase' in employment, a term used in Table 6 of
          Appendix A for those who  have  taken  over  or  invested  in  an
          existing UK business.  In the alternative,  that  the  Respondent
          should have applied paragraph 245AA of the Immigration  Rules  on
          evidential flexibility to the application  and  made  a  specific
          request for the P45 documents;


     iii) that the Respondent erred in finding that the Applicant  was  not
          entitled to apply  under  the  accelerated  indefinite  leave  to
          remain route or rely on the transitional provisions for those who
          entered the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) route prior to  6  April  2014.
          As such, the Respondent erred in not  accepting  the  Applicant's
          evidence  of  job  creation   which   included   aggregation   of
          employment.


Immigration law and rules


10. The Applicant's application for indefinite leave to remain was made  on
    23 September 2015 and the decision to refuse it was made on 4  February
    2016.   The  relevant  Immigration  Rules  for  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrants were amended by HC 535 on 19 November 2015 with  corresponding
    changes to the Respondent's guidance being made with  effect  from  the
    same date.  However, HC 535 included transitional provisions such  that
    if an application had been made for leave to remain before 19  November
    2015, the application would be decided in accordance with the Rules  in
    force on 18 November  2015.   The  relevant  Immigration  Rules  to  be
    applied to this Applicant are those in force on 18  November  2015  and
    are, so far as relevant, set out below.


11. Paragraph 245DF of the Immigration Rules sets out the requirements  for
    a grant of indefinite leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant, which includes at sub-paragraph (c), that  an  applicant  must
    have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs 35 to 53  of  Appendix  A.
    Paragraph 38 of Appendix A  to  the  Immigration  Rules  provides  that
    available points for applications for indefinite leave  to  remain  are
    shown in Table 6[1].  Table 6 provides as follows:

|Row    |Investment and business activity                   |Points  |
|1      |If the applicant has invested, or had invested on  |20      |
|       |his behalf, not less than �200,000 (or �50,000 if, |        |
|       |in his last grant of leave, he was awarded points  |        |
|       |for funds of �50,000) in cash directly into one or |        |
|       |more businesses in the UK.                         |        |
|       |                                                   |        |
|       |The applicant will not need to provide evidence of |        |
|       |this investment if he was awarded points for it, as|        |
|       |set out in Table 5, in his previous grant of entry |        |
|       |clearance or leave to remain as a Tier 1           |        |
|       |(Entrepreneur) Migrant.                            |        |
|2      |On a date no earlier than three months prior to the|20      |
|       |date of application, the applicant was;            |        |
|       |registered with HM Revenue and Customs as          |        |
|       |self-employed, or                                  |        |
|       |registered with Companies House as a director of a |        |
|       |new or an existing business.  Directors who are on |        |
|       |the list of disqualified directors provided by     |        |
|       |Companies House will not be awarded points.        |        |
|3      |The applicant has:                                 |20      |
|       |established a new UK business or businesses that   |        |
|       |has or have created the equivalent of X new full   |        |
|       |time jobs for persons settled in the UK, or        |        |
|       |taken over or invested in an existing UK business  |        |
|       |or businesses and his services or investment have  |        |
|       |resulted in a net increase in the employment       |        |
|       |provided by the business or businesses for persons |        |
|       |settled in the UK by creating the equivalent of X  |        |
|       |new full time jobs where X is at least 2.          |        |
|       |Where the applicant's last grant of entry clearance|        |
|       |or leave to enter or remain was as a Tier 1        |        |
|       |(Entrepreneur) Migrant, the jobs must have existed |        |
|       |for at least 12 months during the last grant of    |        |
|       |leave.                                             |        |
|4      |The applicant has spent the specified continuous   |15      |
|       |period lawfully in the UK, with absences from the  |        |
|       |UK of no more than 180 days in any 12 calendar     |        |
|       |months during that period.                         |        |
|       |The specified period must have been spent with     |        |
|       |leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, as a     |        |
|       |Businessperson and/or as an Innovator, of which the|        |
|       |most recent period must have been spent with leave |        |
|       |as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.                |        |
|       |The specified continuous period is:                |        |
|       |3 years if the number of new full time jobs, X,    |        |
|       |referred to in row 3 above is at least 10, or      |        |
|       |3 years if the applicant has:                      |        |
|       |established a new business that has had an income  |        |
|       |from business activity of at least �5 million      |        |
|       |during a 3 year period in which the applicant has  |        |
|       |had leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, or   |        |
|       |taken over or invested in an existing UK business  |        |
|       |and his services or investment have resulted in a  |        |
|       |net increase in income from business activity to   |        |
|       |that business of �5 million during a 3 year period |        |
|       |in which the applicant has had leave as a Tier 1   |        |
|       |(Entrepreneur) Migrant, when compared to the       |        |
|       |immediately preceding 3 year period, or            |        |
|       |5 years in all other cases.                        |        |
|       |                                                   |        |
|       |...                                                |        |



12. Paragraph 46 of Appendix A states that  documentary  evidence  must  be
    provided in all cases and the specified documents  in  paragraph  46-SD
    are required as evidence of any investment and business  activity  when
    the applicant had leave  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.   The
    specified documents which are relevant to the requirements in row 3  of
    Table 6 above provide, so far as relevant, as follows:


      Paragraph 46-SD(c), Appendix A
      The applicant must provide the following specified documents  to  show
      that he has established a UK business:
      ...
      (iii) Evidence that the business is subject to UK taxation:
           1) ...
           2) If the applicant is a director of a  business,  the  business
              must be registered for corporation tax and the applicant must
              provide  documentation  from  HM  Revenue  &  Customs   which
              confirms this.


      Paragraph 46-SD(h), Appendix A
      If the applicant is required to score  points  for  creating  the  net
      increase in employment in Table 5 or Table  6,  he  must  provide  the
      following information and specified documents:
              i) A HM Revenue & Customs  Employee  Payment  Record,  showing
                 details of the earnings for the  settled  worker  for  each
                 week that he worked for the applicant, and signed and dated
                 by the applicant;
             ii) If the date of the start of the employment is not shown  in
                 the Employee Payment  Record,  an  original  HM  Revenue  &
                 Customs form P45 or form P46 (also called  a  Full  Payment
                 Submission) for the settled worker, showing the start  date
                 of the employment; ...


13. Also relevant to the requirements of row 3 in Table 6  of  Appendix  FM
    above, is further provision as to full-time jobs  and  the  period  for
    which they must have existed, set  out  in  paragraphs  49  and  50  of
    Appendix A, which provide as follows:

      49.  A full time job is one involving at least 30  hours'  of  work  a
      week.  Two or more part time jobs that add up to 30 hours a week  will
      count as one full time job but one full time job of more than 30 hours
      work a week will not count as more than one full time job.

      50. Where the applicant's last grant of entry clearance or leave was a
      Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, the jobs must have existed for a  total
      of at least 12 months during the period in which the migrant had leave
      in that category.  This need not consist of 12 consecutive months  and
      the jobs need not exist at the date of the application, provided  they
      existed for at least 12 months during the period in which the  migrant
      had leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.


14. There are two pieces of guidance produced by the Respondent  which  are
    relevant to the present case.  The first is the  Respondent's  'Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) of the Points Based System - Policy  Guidance',  version
    09/2015 (the "Policy Guidance")[2].  The  second  is  the  Respondent's
    'Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)' guidance version  14.0  published  7  September
    2015 (the "Internal Guidance").


15. The Policy Guidance is structured so as to deal  firstly  with  initial
    applications for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and
    then with the  attributes  required  for  extension  applications  from
    paragraph 123 onwards.  The provisions of Table 6 of Appendix A set out
    above are repeated.  A table is provided at paragraph 133  setting  out
    documents required to show that a business is subject to United Kingdom
    taxation to satisfy  paragraph  46-SD(c)(iii)(2)  of  Appendix  A.   It
    states as follows for Directors or companies:


      Businesses must be registered for corporation tax and you must provide
      documentation from HMRC which confirms this.  For example, form  CT41G
      from HMRC or a completed HMRC tax  return  document  showing  the  tax
      reference number for the company.  If the reporting  is  done  online,
      you should provide a printout of the form and sign it as correct.


16. The Policy Guidance includes a section on job creation, which,  so  far
    as relevant, provides as follows:


      Job creation
      152.  If you have established new businesses,  those  businesses  must
           have, between them, created the equivalent or  two  extra  full-
           time jobs for at least two people who are settled in the UK  and
           those jobs must have existed for at least 12 months each.
      153.  Where you have taken over or invested in  an  existing  business
           ...
      154.  We consider a 30-hour working week to be  full-time.   Part-time
           work can form part of the total number of  hours  of  employment
           created.
      155.  ...
      156.  ... If you are a Director of a business you must show that  your
           business has created two new posts.
      157.  ...
      158.  ...
      159.   EXAMPLES:  We  would  consider  the  following  as   acceptable
           employment:
           . The working hours of two part-time workers can be combined  to
             add up to 30 hours a week or more and form the  equivalent  of
             one full-time post.
           . A worker who is employed for part of a year  and  then  leaves
             the post can  be  replaced  by  another  worker  so  that  the
             employment as a whole adds up to 12 months.  However, if there
             is a gap between one worker leaving a post and another  worker
             starting employment, the period when the post  is  not  filled
             will not be counted.  Only periods during which  a  worker  is
             employed in a post will be considered.
           . A single worker can be employed for 24 months.  The employment
             can also be made up of a six-month period for one  worker  and
             an 18-month period for another.
           . If four workers are employed for 26 weeks (six  months)  each,
             their hours of employment may be added together.


      These examples go further than the Immigration Rules.  The Immigration
      Rules at Appendix A Tables 5 and 6 state  that  you  must  create  the
      equivalent of two or more full-time jobs that have existed for a total
      of at least  12  months  during  your  last  period  of  leave  as  an
      Entrepreneur in order to extend your  leave  or  meet  the  settlement
      criteria.   Appendix  A,  paragraphs  49  and  50  provide  additional
      explanation.


      For those applying for entry clearance or  switching  into  the  route
      from 6 April 2014, the employment must be for at  least  two  separate
      jobs, and must exist for at least a full 12 months each.


      Transitional arrangement - people who successfully  applied  to  enter
      the route before 6 April 2014 may continue to employ:
      .  a single worker for 24 months; or
      .  one worker for 6 months and one for 18 months; or
      .  four workers for six months each
      and still meet the requirements when they apply for extensions and for
      settlement. ...


17. The documents required to show job creation are set out  in  paragraphs
    167 and following and include, inter alia, the  HMRC  Employee  Payment
    Record and the P45/P46 if no start dates  are  shown  on  the  Employee
    Payment Record.  There are additional documents set  out  in  paragraph
    181 for those taking over or joining existing business.


18. The Policy Guidance  does  not  include  any  substantive  guidance  on
    applications for indefinite leave to remain and  instead  at  paragraph
    233 includes a link to further guidance - the Internal Guidance.


19. The Internal Guidance sets out the same examples of job creation as  in
    the Policy Guidance above.  It further states that for those  going  in
    to Tier 1 as an Entrepreneur on or after 6 April 2014,  the  employment
    must be for at least 2 separate jobs and must exist for at least a full
    12 months each.  Those who successfully applied before 6 April 2014 may
    continue to employ persons as per  the  examples  in  the  transitional
    arrangement set out in the Policy Guidance above.


20.  As  to  applications  for  further  extensions  and  applications  for
    indefinite leave to remain, the Internal Guidance provides as follows:

    Further extensions and ILR applications
    ...
    For ILR applications, the same criteria apply unless the  applicant  is
    applying under the accelerated ILR route.
    If applying under the accelerated ILR the  applicant  must  demonstrate
    that they have created a total of 10 full time positions for  at  least
    10 people.  Aside from the number of jobs, the criteria and  evidential
    requirements are the same as for an extension application.


Ground  (i)  -  registration  for  UK  corporation  tax  -   paragraph   46-
SD(c)(iii)(2) of Appendix A

21. The  Applicant  was  required  to  show  that  he  was  registered  for
    corporation tax and provide documentation from  HM  Revenue  &  Customs
    confirming  this  (paragraph  46-SD(c)(iii)(2)  of  Appendix  FM),  for
    example by form CT41G or a completed tax return  document  showing  the
    tax reference number for the company.


22. In the present case, the Applicant submitted a document from HM Revenue
    & Customs dated 2 July 2012, which was not numbered/lettered but headed
    "Corporation  Tax  Information  for  new  companies".   It  included  a
    reference number which was  expressly  stated  to  be  the  Applicant's
    company's Unique Taxpayer Reference.  The  Respondent  did  not  accept
    that this satisfied the evidential requirement  that  the  company  was
    registered for UK corporation tax because it did not expressly  say  so
    and because the letter went on  to  set  out  future  steps  that  were
    required when the company started a business activity.  The refusal  on
    that basis is unreasonable and irrational.  The fact that  the  company
    had been given a Unique Taxpayer Reference, on any rational view  shows
    that the company has been registered for UK  corporation  tax  and  the
    fact that further  information  was  required  to  set  up  the  online
    corporation tax service and for future payment of tax does not  detract
    from that.  The application for Judicial Review is therefore granted on
    the first ground.


23. The Applicant sought to adduce a written statement from his  accountant
    to confirm that the letter from HM Revenue & Customs of 2 July 2012 was
    the replacement format to the form CT41-G referred  to  in  the  Policy
    Guidance.  The Respondent objected to this new material being added and
    relied upon as it was not evidence that was before  the  Respondent  at
    the time of decision.  I do not admit the document because it  was  not
    before the Respondent at the time of the decision  and  in  any  event,
    because it is unnecessary to determine the issue in the first ground of
    challenge.  The documents which were  submitted  with  the  application
    were sufficiently clear on their face.

Ground (ii) - requirements of  paragraph  46-SD(h)(ii)  of  Appendix  A  and
evidential flexibility

24. The second  ground  of  challenge  turns  upon  the  interpretation  of
    paragraph 46-SD(h)(ii) of Appendix A and specifically  whether  it  has
    any application to this Applicant, whose application is under row  3(a)
    of Table 6, as he has established a new UK business that has created  a
    number of new jobs, as opposed to  a  person  who  has  taken  over  or
    invested in an existing UK business under row 3(b) which requires a net
    increase in employment provided by that business.


25. The correct approach to interpretation of the Immigration Rules is  set
    out by the Supreme Court in Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC
    16, with reference to  Odelola  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2009] UKHL 25.  Lord Brown stated:


      [10] There is really no dispute  about  the  proper  approach  to  the
      construction of the Rules ... Like any other question of construction,
      this ... depends on the language of the rule,  construed  against  the
      relevant background.  That involves a consideration of the immigration
      rules  as  a  whole  and  the  function  which  they  serve   in   the
      administration of immigration policy ... Essentially it comes to this.
       The Rules are not to be construed with all the strictness  applicable
      to the construction  of  a  statue  or  a  statutory  instrument  but,
      instead, sensibly according to the natural and ordinary meaning of the
      words used, recognising that they are statements of the  Secretary  of
      State's administrative policy ... the court's task is to discover from
      the words used in the Rules what the Secretary of State must be  taken
      to have intended.  After all, under section 3(2)  of  the  Immigration
      Act 1971,  the  Secretary  of  State  has  to  lay  the  Rules  before
      Parliament which then has the opportunity to disapprove them.


26. Further, in Iqbal v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 169, Lord  Justice  Vos,  when
    considering the interpretation of paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A to  the
    Immigration Rules, confirmed what was said  by  the  Supreme  Court  in
    Mahad and at paragraph 33 stated:

      [33] As Lord Brown explained, the court should properly have regard to
      the  Secretary  of  State's  purpose  and   intention   as   discerned
      objectively from the words used.  The court will also lean against  an
      absurd construction, with the words in question can bear the preferred
      alternative meaning (see Jacob LJ in Lewis v Eliades [2004] 1 WLR  692
      at paragraphs 58-61).  But the court cannot and  should  not  construe
      the Secretary of State's Rules to mean something different from  what,
      on a fair objective reading, they actually say.  In this case, the two
      main construction points advanced respectively  by  Mr  Iqbal  and  Mr
      Macdonald urge that result.  I would hope that arguements of this kind
      will be less prevalent in the future.


27. In the present case, the Applicant  relies  on  the  opening  words  of
    paragraph 46-SD(h) of Appendix A that he must provide  the  information
    and documents specified therein "if the applicant is required to  score
    points for creating the net increase in employment in Table 5 or  Table
    6".  Tables 5 and 6  both  contain  alternative  provisions  in  row  3
    depending on whether a person has established  a  new  UK  business  or
    whether they have taken over or invested in an  existing  UK  business.
    The language used for a new UK business is the creation  of  new  full-
    time jobs and the language used for taking  over  or  investing  in  an
    existing UK business is a net increase in the employment provided.  The
    Applicant submits that the natural and ordinary meaning of paragraph 46-
    SD(h) is that it only applies to those required to show a net  increase
    in employment provided, therefore applicable only  to  those  who  have
    applied on the basis that they have taken over invested in an  existing
    UK business.  The wording used has no application  to  the  requirement
    for job creation when a new UK business is established.


28. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the  use  of  the  term  "net
    increase" was not  a  term  of  art  or  defined  in  any  way  in  the
    Immigration Rules but in effect just meant "jobs".  It is of note  that
    this provision has  since  been  amended  expressly  to  refer  to  job
    creation and  not  a  net  increase  in  employment.   It  was  further
    submitted that to interpret the provision in the way submitted  by  the
    Applicant would lead to an absurd construction as there was no separate
    provision in paragraph 46-SD or elsewhere in Appendix A  for  specified
    documents to be submitted by a person such as  the  Applicant  who  had
    established a new UK business.


29. The Secretary of State's purpose and intention is to be ascertained  by
    reference to the language she has used  in  making  Immigration  Rules.
    Although not a defined term, the wording used in paragraph 46-SD(h)  is
    identical to that in row 3(b) of Table 6 and the purpose as well as the
    ordinary and natural meaning of that provision  is  that  it  therefore
    refers back to applications made under row 3(b), namely those  were  an
    applicant has taken over or invested in an existing UK business.  It is
    not possible to read the words in question to mean something  different
    from what, on a fair and objective  reading  they  actually  say.   Job
    creation and net increase in employment may, on the facts overlap,  but
    they do not necessarily require the same thing in  every  case  and  to
    read "net increase" as "jobs" does alter the meaning.


30. Although the Respondent's  interpretation  permits  more  logically  of
    uniform requirements to all applicants, whether they  establish  a  new
    business or takeover or invest in an existing one, it would require not
    just a process of construction of paragraph 46-SD(h) but  a  redrafting
    of it to replace "net increase in employment" with "new job  creation".
    In any event, the absurd result has only limited effect as an applicant
    is still required to provide documentary evidence  to  show  that  they
    have created the required number  of  new  full  time  jobs  (the  same
    substantive requirement) just that the specified documents to show this
    are not set out expressly in the Immigration Rules.


31. In the circumstances where I agree with the interpretation of paragraph
    46-SD(h)  of  Appendix  A  contended  for  by  the  Applicant,  he  has
    established that the requirements in subparagraph (ii) do not apply  to
    him as a person who has established a new UK business as per  row  3(a)
    of Table 6.  As such, the Respondent's refusal of  the  application  on
    the basis that the Applicant had failed to submit P45/P46 documents for
    his employees because the start date of employment was not shown on the
    Employee Payment Records submitted,  is  not  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules and is unreasonable and/or  irrational.   It  is  not
    therefore necessary to go on to  separately  consider  the  alternative
    argument under this ground, that the Respondent  should  in  any  event
    have applied  evidential  flexibility  under  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration Rules to request P45/P46 documentation from the  Applicant.
    For these reasons, the second ground for judicial review is granted.

Ground (iii) - application of transitional provisions  to  applications  for
indefinite leave to remain and evidence of job creation

32. The first issue to determine in  the  final  ground  of  challenge,  is
    whether the transitional provisions set out in the Policy Guidance  and
    the Internal Guidance applied to applications for indefinite  leave  to
    remain under the accelerated route.  The accelerated route is that  set
    out in row 4(a) of Table 6, that an applicant needs to have spent  only
    three years with continuous lawful residence in the United Kingdom as a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant if he has created the  equivalent  of  10
    new full-time jobs for persons settled in the UK.  The  standard  route
    requires five years' continuous lawful residence in the United  Kingdom
    as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  if  a  person  has  created  the
    equivalent of two new full-time jobs for persons settled in the UK.


33. The requirements in row 3 of Table 6 are for the creation  of  (or  net
    increase in) jobs expressed to be the 'equivalent of X  new  full  time
    jobs' where X is 2 for the standard route and 10  for  the  accelerated
    route.  The jobs must have existed for at least 12  months  during  the
    last grant of leave but there is no specification within the table  (or
    elsewhere in Appendix A) of how many people must have been employed for
    those jobs.  Paragraphs 49 and 50 of Appendix A further define  what  a
    full-time job is (one involving at least 30 hours of work  a  week  and
    permitting aggregation of part-time jobs adding up to 30 hours a  week)
    and the duration of a job (a total of at least 12 months which need not
    be consecutive).


34. The Policy Guidance in paragraph  152,  states  that  if  a  person  is
    establishing a new business, it must have created the equivalent of two
    extra full-time jobs for at least two people...and those jobs must have
    existed for at least 12 months each.  What is considered  to  be  full-
    time is set out in paragraph 154 and one of the examples  in  paragraph
    159 in the same terms as  paragraph  49  of  Appendix  A.   The  second
    example in  paragraph  159  is  of  a  situation  that  corresponds  to
    paragraph 50 of Appendix A that employment of at least 12  months  need
    not be of 12 consecutive months.


35. The final two examples in paragraph 159 of the Policy Guidance  provide
    examples of how the equivalent of two extra full-time jobs existing for
    at least 12 months could be met by one person  being  employed  for  24
    months or different combinations of two or four workers  adding  up  to
    the same period.  It is expressly stated that these examples go further
    than  the  Immigration  Rules  and  are   preserved   as   transitional
    arrangements only  for  those  who  successfully  entered  the  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant route prior to 6 April 2014.


36. The Internal Guidance  states  that  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain
    applications under the standard route, the same criteria apply  as  set
    out in the Policy Guidance and repeated in the  Internal  Guidance  (as
    set out above).  If a person is applying under the  accelerated  route,
    then a person must demonstrate that they have created  a  total  of  10
    full-time positions for at least 10 people but otherwise  the  criteria
    and evidential requirements are the same.


37. The Applicant entered the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant category  prior
    to 6 April 2014 and it is submitted that the transitional  arrangements
    therefore apply to him.  Counsel for the Applicant submitted that these
    apply whether his application was under  the  standard  or  accelerated
    route given that, firstly, the requirements in Table 6  of  Appendix  A
    are the same save for the number of jobs  which  need  to  be  created;
    secondly, there is no distinction in the Policy Guidance and no express
    exclusion of the transitional arrangements for those applying under the
    accelerated route and finally,  reliance  is  placed  on  the  Internal
    Guidance that the criteria and evidential  requirements  are  the  same
    under the accelerated route.


38. The Respondent relies upon the requirements set  out  in  the  Internal
    Guidance that applications under the accelerated route  for  indefinite
    leave to remain must demonstrate creation of a total  of  10  full-time
    positions for at least 10 people and decided  in  this  case  that  the
    Applicant had not demonstrated this on the evidence submitted with  his
    application (which was based on an aggregation of  hours  worked  in  a
    three year period to show an equivalent total of 17 new full-time  jobs
    being created).


39. Counsel for the Respondent  submitted  that  transitional  arrangements
    were in place because previous versions of the  guidance  went  further
    than the Immigration Rules permitted with the examples given of how the
    job creation requirements could be met, which was in  error.   However,
    for those who have relied upon it in the  past  -  those  entering  the
    route prior to 6 April 2014, the position is maintained  but  only  for
    those applying under the standard route.  The reason for this was  said
    to be that the accelerated route was specifically to  reward  the  most
    successful entrepreneurs but that there was never any representation or
    promise about how to  meet  the  job  creation  requirements  for  such
    applications and therefore no transitional arrangements  were  required
    for the accelerated route.


40. After the conclusion  of  the  substantive  hearing,  Counsel  for  the
    Respondent submitted a note and a copy of the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  of
    the Points Based System - Policy Guidance, version 10/2013  in  support
    of the submissions made at the hearing about no promises being made  in
    respect of the accelerated route  to  apply  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain.  The Applicant strongly objected to the  admission  of  further
    evidence and submissions on the basis that they were vastly out of time
    having been submitted after the conclusion of the  substantive  hearing
    and no  formal  application  to  adduce  evidence  was  made.   In  the
    circumstances, Counsel for the Appellant did  not  propose  to  respond
    substantively to the submissions unless and  until  they  and  the  new
    evidence was admitted.


41. I have considered the additional material from the  Respondent  and  no
    further submissions are required from the Appellant in  response.   The
    guidance version 10/2013 sets out the same examples as in paragraph 159
    of the Policy Guidance in relation to extension applications.   In  the
    same way as the Policy Guidance relevant  to  the  present  application
    does, a separate link was given to another document for information  on
    applications for indefinite leave to remain.  Counsel  did  not  submit
    the document relevant to applications for indefinite leave  to  remain,
    although the link in the document that was provided still functions.


42. However, rather unhelpfully,  in  relation  to  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    applications, the only guidance in that other document is  that  for  a
    person to qualify for indefinite leave in this capacity, he  must  meet
    the requirements listed in the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Guidance.   There
    is no link to that guidance and it is unclear as to whether  it  refers
    back to the then current version of the Policy Guidance (which would be
    a circular reference between documents with no additional  guidance  at
    all on applications for indefinite leave to remain) or the then current
    Internal Guidance (which so far as I can ascertain  says  nothing  more
    either on different requirements to be applied to  an  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain under het accelerated route).   Either  way,
    without a copy of that document (or from what I can ascertain  it  is),
    the submission from Counsel is not made good.


43. There is no witness evidence from the Respondent as to the  reason  for
    and  extent  of  the  transitional  arrangements  and   the   documents
    submitted, even if the one submitted after the hearing was admitted, do
    not say anything expressly one way or the other about  the  application
    of transitional arrangements to applications for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain under the accelerated route.  In the circumstances,  and  taking
    into account the objections raised by the Applicant, I do not admit the
    further submissions  and  evidence  as  they  do  not  in  all  of  the
    circumstances assist in determination of the  present  application  for
    Judicial Review.


44.  The  Policy  Guidance  and  the  Internal   Guidance   for   extension
    applications and for applications for indefinite leave to  remain  both
    refer not only to the creation of a total number of full-time positions
    but also that these must be for at least a minimum number of  people  -
    under the standard route, 2 full-time positions for at least  2  people
    and under the accelerated route, 10 full-time positions for at least 10
    people.  Examples are given under the heading transitional arrangements
    for how that can be met where two full-time positions are required  but
    which do not necessarily require jobs for at least two people and it is
    expressly stated that the same  criteria  and  evidential  requirements
    apply to applications for indefinite leave to remain under the standard
    or accelerated route, save for the number of jobs and people  being  10
    rather than 2 under the accelerated route.  The examples given for  the
    purposes of transitional arrangements could  easily  be  scaled  up  to
    replace 2 with 10 but have not been expressly done  within  either  the
    Policy Guidance or the Internal Guidance.


45. Reading together the requirements in rows 3 and 4  of  Table  6,  which
    require the creation of the equivalent of 2 or 10  new  full-time  jobs
    without specifying the number of people to be  employed,  the  examples
    given of how this requirement can be met, including as  a  transitional
    arrangement and the  express  provision  that  the  same  criteria  and
    evidential requirements apply to applications for indefinite  leave  to
    remain both under the standard and accelerated  routes  (save  for  the
    difference in the number of jobs  to  be  created),  I  find  that  the
    transitional arrangements apply equally to  those  applying  under  the
    accelerated route for indefinite leave to remain  and  therefore  apply
    equally to this Applicant.


46. There is nothing to expressly exclude the transitional  protection  for
    such applications, nor to limit it to extension applications  or  those
    for  settlement  under  the  standard  route.   Indeed,  it  would   be
    surprising if there were given that the formulation of the  substantive
    requirements in the Immigration Rules is  exactly  the  same  for  both
    routes save for the number of full time jobs to be created.   There  is
    no evidence which supports the  submission  made  by  Counsel  for  the
    Respondent that the transitional  arrangements  do  not  apply  because
    there was only a promise in  relation  to  extension  applications  and
    settlement under the standard route.  Although it may be the case  that
    the accelerated route is to provide a reward for  the  most  successful
    entrepreneurs, it is not logical or rational that  that  would  exclude
    transitional arrangements for an alternative  way  in  which  the  same
    requirement that applies to applicants for an  extension  of  leave  or
    settlement  under  the  standard  route  who  also   entered   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) prior to 6 April 2014 at the same time, could be met.


47. As to the Applicant's application in the present case,  the  Respondent
    did not consider the evidence of job creation that he  submitted  which
    appears at pages 175 to 190  of  the  bundle  (with  further  documents
    comprising the Full Payment Submissions at pages 197  to  236)  on  the
    basis that it was not permissible to aggregate the hours worked over  a
    three-year period to satisfy the requirement of creating the equivalent
    of 10 new full-time jobs for persons settled in the United  Kingdom  as
    the transitional arrangements did not apply.  It was not accepted  that
    the evidence that was submitted did not show the creation of  10  full-
    time jobs for at least 10 persons, which were equivalent  to  30  hours
    worked per week for a continuous 12 month period each.


48. It was accepted by both parties at the hearing that if the transitional
    provisions were found to apply to the Applicant,  then  the  Respondent
    must consider the evidence that was submitted as to  job  creation  and
    determine whether it satisfied the requirements in  rows  3  and  4  of
    Table 6 of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  In the context  of  an
    application for Judicial Review, it is not for the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    make any findings on such evidence in the first  instance.   For  these
    reasons, the witness statement from the  Applicant's  accountant  which
    also deals with the issue of job creation and the evidence submitted in
    support thereof, is  also  not  relevant  and  not  admitted  in  these
    proceedings.


49. For all of these  reasons,  the  application  for  Judicial  Review  is
    granted on the final ground as the Respondent has failed to  apply  her
    own  Policy  Guidance   and   Internal   Guidance,   specifically   the
    transitional  arrangements  for  those   who   entered   the   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant route prior  to  6  April  2014,  which  I  find
    applies equally to those applying for indefinite leave to remain  under
    the accelerated route as to those applying for an extension of leave to
    remain and indefinite leave to remain under  the  standard  route.   As
    such, the Respondent has failed to reach a decision as to  whether  the
    Applicant has satisfied the requirements in rows 3 and 4 of Table 6  of
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.


50. As the Applicant has succeeded on all three grounds of  challenge,  the
    Respondent's decision must be quashed as it was not lawful, rational or
    reasonable for the application to be refused for the reasons given.


Order


I therefore make an  Order  quashing  the  Respondent's  decisions  dated  4
February 2016 and 14 March 2016 (the latter being the administrative  review
decision maintaining the original decision).


Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

The Respondent did not seek permission to appeal.  I am however required  to
consider that in any event.  I refuse permission to appeal to the  Court  of
Appeal because there is no arguable error of law in my decision above.

Costs

The Respondent shall pay the Applicant's reasonable costs of this
application, to be assessed if not agreed.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.
