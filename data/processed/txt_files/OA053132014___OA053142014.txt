Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Megha, instructed by Western Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Miss A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Kenya born on 10 April 1998 and  18  May
    1996 and they appealed against the  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer dated 9 January 2014 to refuse them  entry  clearance  to  join
    their father, C N G who had been lawfully residence  in  the  UK  since
    1986.

 2. On 6 January 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Butler  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal dismissed their appeals both on the immigration grounds and on
    human rights grounds. He found, however, that  the  appellants'  father
    had sole responsibility for the appellant s and  that  the  appellants'
    mother effectively abandoned them to the care  of  their  step  mother,
    their father's now wife, who subsequently joined him in the UK in  2008
    with their two youngest daughters. The judge found  there  was  however
    insufficient income for their maintenance and also concluded  that  the
    appellant did not have adequate accommodation.

 3. He found the sponsor had been in  employment  since  1997  and  he  had
    control of his "work flat" in question and alternated between the  flat
    he owned and the service flat.

 4. A Rule 24 response was submitted by the Secretary of State on the basis
    that the  grounds  of  application  were  misconceived  in  respect  of
    maintenance and accommodation: KA and Others (Adequacy of  maintenance)
    Pakistan [2006] UKIAT 00065 made it clear that the yardstick to be used
    was an objective comparison with the funds received by  the  family  on
    income support and the level of income. The test was whether, after the
    housing cost of the family had been taken into  account,  the  family's
    income was greater than that of a family on income  support.   In  fact
    the respondent submitted that for a family of four  children  with  two
    parents over the age of 18 years at the date of decision the  following
    was required:

         Couple   �112.55

         Dependent child     �65.62 (x4)

         Family premium      �17.80

         Total    �392.43

 5. With respect to the accommodation the respondent submitted that if  the
    family lived together in the one bedroom flat that had  been  purchased
    by the sponsor it  would  be  overcrowded.  If,  in  order  to  prevent
    overcrowding the appellants were to be separated this would  result  in
    one of them living alone for some period as it was the evidence of  the
    sponsor as cited in the ground at paragraph  1(b)  that  he  alternated
    between his own flat and the service flat.  It was difficult to see how
    a minor child could be considered to be accommodated adequately  if  he
    were left alone at night for certain periods.

 6. An error of law was found in the decision of Judge Butler on the  basis
    that the judge stated that he found the income  of  the  family  to  be
    insufficient but did not show how he arrived at  the  figure  required.
    The basis of calculation could not be clearly discerned.  Further  with
    regard to accommodation the judge failed to take into account that  the
    sponsor had been in his employment since 1997 when concluding that  the
    tenure was precarious.  The fact that he was only engaged in a  licence
    did not necessarily make the tenancy precarious or inadequate  compared
    with other rental options.

 7. At the resumed hearing before me a further bundle was submitted  but  I
    reminded the parties that although the Immigration Rules did contain an
    element of projecting forward, the relevant date for my decision was  9
    January 2014.

 8. Mr Megha pointed out  the  papers  where  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal which included  P60s for the tax years ending 5 April 2013 for
    C N G, the first sponsor who indicated that he  earned  �16,886.29  and
    for the same tax year a P60 was submitted for the sponsor wife, Mrs  CN
    and showed that she had earned  �14,187.71.  I note that details of the
    wife's employment  were  also  enclosed  in  the  application  for  the
    appellants.

 9. There was no dispute that paragraph 297 was the relevant section of the
    Immigration Rules for the purposes of this determination.   The  weekly
    gross income for the couple amounted to �597.57 and  the  total  weekly
    outlay in relation  to  accommodation  costs  (mortgage  payments)  and
    council tax was �131.18 (the  mortgage  payment  taken  from  the  bank
    statements at the time of the  decision)  and  �20.89  respectively.  I
    calculated that �445.50 was  left  over.   This  satisfies  the  income
    requirements of �392.43 as calculated by the Secretary of State.

10. The accommodation consists of  a  one  bedroom  flat  purchase  by  the
    sponsor where his wife and two children live.  The sponsor also  has  a
    one bedroomed serviced flat as part of his job.  There does not  appear
    to be any restriction of his  family  living  there.   Although  it  is
    concluded that there  are  two  separate  accommodations,  there  would
    appear to be four rooms to accommodate 6 people (in accordance with the
    Housing Act 1985), and there was a surveyor's report on file confirming
    that there was adequate accommodation for the appellants and their  two
    siblings and parents, albeit that they would have to organise  separate
    accommodation. The sponsor's evidence was that he would live  with  one
    child and the wife and 3 children would live in their  privately  owned
    flat. There was  no  legal  authority  as  Miss  Everett  indicated  in
    relation to the separateness of  the  accommodation  but  I  take  into
    account S  (Pakistan)  (2004)  UKIAT  00006  which  confirms  that  the
    adequacy of accommodation must be assessed in the light of the facts of
    each individual case and the  accommodation  will  not  necessarily  be
    adequate, in terms of the Immigration Rules, simply because it will not
    be statutorily overcrowded in terms of the Housing Act 1985.

11. I have considered both the physical aspects of  accommodation  and  the
    promotion of  family  life.   I  am  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  the
    surveyor's report that the accommodation would be sufficient  in  terms
    of physical space.  The tenancy of the work flat has been held for  the
    sponsor for 16 years (at the date  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision) and I was not persuaded that it was precarious.  There was no
    challenge  that  this  was  indeed  in  existence.   I  note  that  the
    appellants at the date of decision were 14 and 16.  There could  be  an
    adult in  either  accommodation  and  therefore  the  consideration  of
    supervision was not relevant.  That said, there is no specific  age  at
    which a child may be left alone and these are  teenage  girls.   It  is
    clear that family life cannot be promoted whilst the appellants  remain
    in Ghana.  There was no suggestion raised that  the  arrangement  would
    affect the best interests of the children who are already in the United
    Kingdom and I would consider that it would be promote the  family  life
    of all the siblings to be together.

12. It was accepted by Judge Butler that the  sponsor  Mr  Gwaro  had  sole
    responsibility for the appellants. The outstanding issues in respect of
    the Immigration Rules had been maintenance and accommodation  and  Miss
    Everett confirmed that it was clear that  she  could  not  maintain  an
    objection on the basis of the evidence before her.

13. Having previously set the decision of Judge Butler  aside,  further  to
    Section 12(2) (b) of the Tribunals Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007  I
    remake the decision and find that the  appellants  have  fulfilled  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and I allow the appeal.

Notice of Decision

14. Appeals allowed under the Immigration Rules.

Direction regarding anonymity - rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court  proceedings.   An
anonymity order is made because the matter involves minors.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee  award  further  to  The  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and Section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts
and Enforcement Act 2007) but decided to make no fee award  because  of  the
complexity of the decision process.
