                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge GJ Napthine), sitting at Hatton Cross on 15 July, to  a
    s. 82 (1) asylum ''upgrade' appeal by a citizen of Afghanistan, born  2
    January 1997. On 7 May 2013 the appellant was refused asylum, but given
    leave to remain till 2 July 2014, when he will be 17ï¿½.

 2. The appeal to this Tribunal turns on whether the  judge  gave  adequate
    reasons for  not  accepting  the  assessment  of  Robert  Sellwood,  an
    educational psychologist, that the appellant had an IQ of no more  than
    52. In view  of  the  history  the  appellant  gave  in  oral  evidence
    (contrary to Mr Sellwood's opinion that he would be unable  to  do  so,
    but in accordance with advice from counsel - not Mr Eaton), I share the
    judge's surprise at that assessment. However, though it was  very  much
    his business to assess the appellant's oral evidence for himself, it is
    common ground that he needed to do so in the  light  of  Mr  Sellwood's
    report.

 3. The judge dealt with the report as follows:

     50. I do not accept Mr  Sellwood's  assessment  of  the  Appellant.  Mr
         Sellwood did not make clear how he adapted his tests for  the  fact
         that the Appellant lacked all formal education and was  interviewed
         and tested in a foreign language.

     51. Given the unreliability of IQ tests and the  lack  of  evidence  of
         rigour in the conduct of the Appellant's test I do not  accept  the
         stated results of that test.

     52.  I  find  [counsel's]  decision  to  call  the  Appellant  and  his
         performance in giving his evidence to be strong evidence that he is
         someone who operates at a higher level than  the  IQ  of  53  [sic]
         assessed by Mr Sellwood. [at paragraph 53 the judge  gives  further
         details of this]

 4. While the judge was fully entitled to say what he did at paragraphs  52
    - 53, the parties have quite rightly agreed  that  he  needed  to  give
    better reasons than he did at paragraphs  50  -  51  for  rejecting  Mr
    Sellwood's assessment. Mr Sellwood, in a further report attached to the
    grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, has pointed out that not  only
    he had explained in his original report that he  had  used  "non-verbal
    subtests ... as they are the least sensitive to cultural  differences",
    but drawn attention  to  the  lack  of  correlation,  in  a  series  of
    assessments he had carried out before, between the subject's non-verbal
    test results, and the amount of time he had spent in school. These were
    points the judge had needed to note and deal with,  before  taking  his
    own view on Mr Sellwood's assessment.

 5. It is also agreed that there needs  to  be  a  fresh  hearing  of  this
    appeal, which will come before another first-tier judge. As the  first-
    tier hearing was at Hatton Cross, the papers will be sent there,  under
    the usual arrangements; but, if the appellant, who lives in London  E6,
    and his representatives want to apply for a change of venue  to  Taylor
    House, then they should do so at once to the resident judge  at  Hatton
    Cross.

 6. If the Home Office wish to have the appellant  examined  by  their  own
    psychologist,  as  they  are  encouraged  to  do,  then  Mr  Eaton  has
    undertaken on behalf of those  instructing  him  that,  given  suitable
    notice, they will make the appellant available for the purpose. In that
    event, both the Home Office psychologist  and  Mr  Sellwood  should  be
    called to give oral evidence; but it would in any case  be  helpful  to
    the judge at the fresh hearing if Mr Sellwood were called.

Appeal
Fresh hearing in First-tier Tribunal, not before Judge Napthine
