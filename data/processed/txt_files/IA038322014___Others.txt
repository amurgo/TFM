Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr R O'Ryan, instructed by Maya Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Robson promulgated 27.5.14,  allowing  the
    links appeals of the claimants against the decisions of the respondent,
    dated 9.1.14, to refuse their applications for further leave to  remain
    in the UK, and to give directions for their removal from the  UK.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 25.4.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    12.6.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 17.11.4 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Robson should be set aside.

 5. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows. The first claimant came to the UK as a student  in  2003  with
    leave subsequently extended. His wife,  the  second  claimant  and  the
    elder two children (C3 & C4) joined him in 2005 as his  dependants.  C5
    was born in the UK in June 2006 and was included in their further leave
    to  remain  application,  which  extended  their  leave   to   31.3.09.
    Applications for further  leave  to  remain  were  made  out  of  time,
    rejected for payment issues, and ultimately refused with  no  right  of
    appeal on 8.9.09. The claimants' complaint against the solicitor acting
    for them in 2009 was  upheld  by  the  ombudsman.  Since  31.3.09,  the
    claimants have had no immigration status in the UK  and  remained  here
    unlawfully. Their last child C6 was born in  2011  and  has  never  had
    leave to remain.

 6. No further application was made for over 3 years, until  16.10.12  when
    they made applications for leave to remain, including both parents  and
    all 4 children. The applications were refused with no right  of  appeal
    on 7.11.13.

 7. However, the Secretary of State agreed to reconsider the  applications,
    taking into account the Immigration Rules in place from 9.7.12, article
    8 ECHR  private  and  family  life,  and  section  55  of  the  Borders
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  This  resulted  in  the  refusal
    decision of 9.1.14, which was the subject of the appeal to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 8. Judge Robson purported to allow the appeals on both immigration and  in
    the alternative human rights grounds.

 9. The judge found that there were no  significant  ties  of  any  of  the
    claimants to Pakistan and that therefore they each met the requirements
    of paragraph 276ADE. The judge found that removal of the children would
    be disproportionate and  harmful  to  their  future  development,  with
    reference to section 55 and their best  interests.  At  �86  the  judge
    considered that even if he was wrong on the Immigration Rules, he found
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised in the Rules so as
    to justify an article 8 assessment, in which  he  found  there  was  no
    claim by the Secretary of State that granting 'entry  clearance'  would
    be detrimental to the economic well-being of the UK. "Thus it cannot be
    maintained that it is not a disproportionate inference with the  Family
    Right's or indeed Private Life."

10. The grounds of application for permission to appeal set out a number of
    complaints about  the  way  in  which  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    assessed the evidence and applied the law. In his oral  submissions  Mr
    McVeety expanded on the errors of law in  the  determination,  pointing
    out further errors. Whilst he complained about that, Mr O'Ryan did  not
    assert that he was prejudiced by the further grounds  and  specifically
    declined the  opportunity  I  suggested  to  him  that  if  he  was  so
    prejudiced, to make an application for adjournment in order to meet the
    points raised by Mr McVeety. I am not satisfied that the  Secretary  of
    State needed any leave to  elaborate  on  the  errors  of  law  in  the
    decision, of  which  the  grounds  highlight  only  examples.  However,
    insofar as any such leave is required, in  the  circumstances  outlined
    above, I  grant  leave  as  entirely  consistent  with  the  overriding
    objective to  deal  with  cases  fairly  and  justly,  ensuring  proper
    consideration of the issues and avoiding unnecessary delay.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Grimmett found it was  arguable
    that the judge erred in finding that  the  claimants  had  no  ties  to
    Pakistan, in particular because he did not indicate  why  the  siblings
    with whom the first claimant had not fallen out were not ties.

12.  Quite  apart  from  the  inadequately  brief,  confused,  and  largely
    unreasoned article 8  conclusions,  completing  the  entire  article  8
    assessment in just 6 lines, I find that there are such  errors  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal that it cannot stand  and  must  be
    set aside to be remade afresh.

13. In doing so, I have taken into account  the  oral  submissions  of  the
    parties and the rather lengthy skeleton argument of  Mr  O'Ryan,  dated
    24.4.14, prepared for the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing,  and  his
    Rule 24 response, dated 1.7.14.

14. In essence, the submissions of Mr O'Ryan are that:

      a) The appeals of C3, C4 and C5 succeed  under  276ADE91)(iv)  on  the
         basis that they had lived continuously in the UK  for  at  least  7
         years and that it was not reasonable to expect them  to  leave  the
         UK;

      b) That it must follow that if the removal of C3, C4 and C5  would  be
         contrary to the Immigration Rules, then the  parent  claimants  and
         the  last  child  C6  should  also   succeed   as   it   would   be
         disproportionate to split the family;

      c) That the appeals of the parents must succeed under 276ADE(1)(vi) on
         the basis that whilst they are over the age of 18 and have lived in
         the UK for less than 20 years, they have no ties, including social,
         cultural or family with Pakistan.

15. It appears to be common ground that none of the claimants  can  succeed
    under Appendix FM in respect of family life. The parents have no lawful
    status in the UK and thus cannot meet the eligibility requirements  for
    the partner route under R-LTRP. Similarly, as neither parent  has  sole
    responsibility for the children they do not meet the requirements of R-
    LTRPT. Neither do any of the children meet the requirements of  E-LTRC.
    EX1 is not reached because it is  not  a  free-standing  right  and  is
    parasitic on the claimants meeting the preceding requirements.

16. In the circumstances, there is no merit in the first ground of  appeal,
    that the judge failed to consider the best interests of the children in
    the context of EX1 and whether it  would  be  reasonable  for  them  to
    return to Pakistan. However, the reasonableness issue  is  relevant  to
    considerations under paragraph 276ADE and article 8 ECHR private life.

17. Nevertheless I find a number of errors in the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. Some of these are listed below, but I do not  intend  to
    address every error canvassed in submissions before me. The  cumulative
    effect of the several errors of law listed below  are  themselves  more
    than sufficient to require the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to
    be set aside and remade.

18. The finding that the parent claimants had no  ties  to  Pakistan  under
    276ADE, was flawed. The judge relied  on  Ogundimu  (Article  8  -  new
    Rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT, cited to him by Mr O'Ryan,  to  the  effect
    that ties requires something more than merely remote and abstract links
    to the country of proposed deportation or removal. "It  involves  there
    being a continued connection to life in that country, something ties  a
    claimant to his or her country of origin." However, Ogundimu set out at
    �125 a number of factors to be considered, including the length of time
    spent in the country, the age when  the  left,  the  exposure  to  that
    culture, and their language. None of these factors appear to have  been
    properly taken into account.

19. The parent claimants were born in 1977 and 1965 respectively. They came
    to the UK in 2003 and 2005. It  is  clear  that  they  spent  the  vast
    majority of  their  lives  in  Pakistan,  and  continue  to  speak  the
    language. Although it was said that the relationship with  one  brother
    had broken down, relied on by  the  judge  at  �83,  there  were  other
    siblings (�33) in respect of whom there was no evidence that those ties
    had been severed. Even if family ties had been severed,  there  was  no
    evidence that the claimants had lost all social or cultural  ties.  The
    only basis for the conclusion that there were  no  social  or  cultural
    ties is the  last  sentence  of  �84,  where  the  judge  reached  that
    conclusion solely because of the length of time they had  been  in  the
    UK. In the circumstances, there  has  not  been  a  fair  and  balanced
    assessment of ties under paragraph 276ADE.

20. The judge failed to take account of the relevant case law on  the  best
    interests  of  the  child  claimants  and  in  particular  Zoumbas,  EV
    (Philippines), and Azimi-Moyad.

21. Whilst two of the children have lived in the UK for 7 years, and two of
    them were born here, the judge does not seem to have taken into account
    that they are not British citizens and had no entitlement or legitimate
    expectation to be able to be remain and be raised in the UK. They  were
    young and largely their lives have revolved  around  the  family  unit,
    which would be removed together.

22. In Zoumbas v SSHD UKSC it was held that there was no "irrationality  in
    the conclusion that it was in the children's best interests to go  with
    their parents to the Republic of Congo. No doubt  it  would  have  been
    possible to have stated that, other things being equal, it was  in  the
    best interests of the children that they and their  parents  stayed  in
    the United Kingdom so that they could obtain such  benefits  as  health
    care and education which the decision-maker recognised might  be  of  a
    higher standard than would be available in the Congo. But other  things
    were not equal. They were not British citizens. They had  no  right  to
    future education and health care in this country. They were part  of  a
    close-knit family with highly educated parents and were of an age  when
    their emotional needs could only be  fully  met  within  the  immediate
    family unit. Such integration  as  had  occurred  into  United  Kingdom
    society would have been predominantly in the  context  of  that  family
    unit.

23. In EV (Philippines) and Others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 874 it  was  held
    that despite finding, in a family's appeal against a decision to remove
    them, that the best interests of the children lay in  continuing  their
    education in the United Kingdom with both parents also remaining in the
    United Kingdom, the Tribunal had been entitled to find that the need to
    maintain immigration control outweighed the children's best interests.

24. In the course of giving judgment the Court of Appeal gave  guidance  on
    how to interpret and  apply  the  best  interests  of  children  in  an
    immigration context. Paragraphs 32 to 37 state:

         "32. There is a danger in this field of moving  from  looseness  of
         terms to semantics. At the same time there could be said  to  be  a
         tension between (a) treating the best interests of the child  as  a
         primary consideration which could be outweighed by others  provided
         that  no  other  consideration  was  treated  as  inherently   more
         significant; and (b) treating  the  child's  best  interests  as  a
         consideration which must rank higher than  any  other  which  could
         nevertheless be outweighed by others. It is material,  however,  to
         note that Lord Kerr, as he made clear, was dealing with a  case  of
         children who were  British  citizens  and  where  there  were  very
         powerful other factors - see [41] below -in favour of not  removing
         them ('the best interests of the child  clearly  favour  a  certain
         course'/ 'the outcome of cases  such  as  the  present').  He  also
         agreed with the judgment of Lady Hale.  In  those  circumstance  we
         should, in my judgment, be guided  by  the  formulation  which  she
         adopted.

         33. More important for present purposes is to know how the tribunal
         should approach the proportionality exercise if it  has  determined
         that the best interests of the child  or  children  are  that  they
         should continue with their education in England. Whether or not  it
         is in the interests of a child to continue his or her education  in
         England may depend on what assumptions one makes as to what happens
         to the parents. There can be cases where it is in the child's  best
         interests to remain in education in the UK, even though one or both
         parents did not remain here. In the present case, however,  I  take
         the FTT's finding to be that it was in the best  interests  of  the
         children to continue their education in England with  both  parents
         living here. That assumes that both parents are here. But the  best
         interests of the child are to be determined  by  reference  to  the
         child alone without reference to the immigration history or  status
         of either parent.

         34. In determining whether or not, in a case such as  the  present,
         the need for immigration control outweighs the  best  interests  of
         the children, it is necessary to determine the relative strength of
         the factors which make it in their best interests to  remain  here;
         and also to take account of any factors that point the other way.

         35. A decision as to what is in the best interests of children will
         depend on a number of factors such as (a) their age; (b) the length
         of time that they have been here; (c) how long they  have  been  in
         education; (c) what stage their education has reached; (d) to  what
         extent they have become distanced from the country to which  it  is
         proposed that they return; (e) how renewable their connection  with
         it may be; (f) to what extent they will have linguistic, medical or
         other difficulties in adapting to life in that country; and (g) the
         extent to which the  course  proposed  will  interfere  with  their
         family life or their rights (if they have any) as British citizens.

         36. In a sense the tribunal  is  concerned  with  how  emphatic  an
         answer falls to be given  to  the  question:  is  it  in  the  best
         interests of the child to remain? The longer  the  child  has  been
         here, the more advanced (or critical) the stage of  his  education,
         the looser his ties with the country  in  question,  and  the  more
         deleterious the consequences of his return, the greater the  weight
         that falls into one side of the scales. If it is overwhelmingly  in
         the child's best interests that he should not return, the  need  to
         maintain immigration control may  well  not  tip  the  balance.  By
         contrast if it is in the child's best interests to remain, but only
         on balance (with some factors pointing the other way),  the  result
         may be the opposite.

         37. In the balance on the other side there falls to be  taken  into
         account the strong weight to be  given  to  the  need  to  maintain
         immigration control in pursuit of the economic  well-being  of  the
         country and the fact that, ex hypothesi,  the  applicants  have  no
         entitlement to remain. The immigration history of the  parents  may
         also be relevant e.g.  if  they  are  overstayers,  or  have  acted
         deceitfully."

25. I find that in making the assessment referred to, the judge has  failed
    to properly consider the factors going each way. There is  emphasis  on
    those  factors  favouring  the  claimant  children,  but   nothing   of
    substances  about  the  balancing  public  interest  factors   and   in
    particular the "strong weight" to be given  to  the  need  to  maintain
    immigration control. Further the immigration status of the parents  was
    relevant but not included in the balancing exercise.

26. In  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (decisions  affecting  children;  onward
    appeals) [2013] UKUT 197(IAC) the Upper  Tribunal  in  considering  the
    case law in relation to decisions  affecting  children  identified  the
    following principles to assist in the determination  of  appeals  where
    children are affected by the appealed decisions:

         "i) As a starting point it is in the best interests of children  to
         be with both their parents and if both parents  are  being  removed
         from the United Kingdom then the starting point  suggests  that  so
         should dependent children who form part of their  household  unless
         there are reasons to the contrary .
         ii)  It is generally in the interests  of  children  to  have  both
         stability and continuity of social and  educational  provision  and
         the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the  society  to
         which they belong.
         iii)  Lengthy residence in a country other than the state of origin
         can lead to development of social  cultural  and  educational  ties
         that it would be  inappropriate  to  disrupt,  in  the  absence  of
         compelling  reason  to  the  contrary.  What  amounts  to   lengthy
         residence is not clear cut  but  past  and  present  policies  have
         identified seven years as a relevant period.
         iv)  Apart from the terms of  published  policies  and  rules,  the
         Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is likely to be  more
         significant to a child than the first seven  years  of  life.  Very
         young children are focussed on  their  parents  rather  than  their
         peers and are adaptable.
         v)  Short periods of residence, particularly ones without leave  or
         the reasonable expectation of  leave  to  enter  or  remain,  while
         claims are promptly  considered,  are  unlikely  to  give  rise  to
         private life deserving of respect in  the  absence  of  exceptional
         factors. In any event, protection of  the  economic  well-being  of
         society amply justifies removal in such cases."

27. The same case also looked at the position of children in onward appeals
    and noted that:
         "(2) Duties to have regard as a primary consideration to  the  best
         interests of a child are so well established that  a  judge  should
         take the point for him  or  herself  as  an  obvious  point  to  be
         considered, where the issue arises on the evidence, irrespective of
         whether the appellants or the advocates have done so.
         (3)  Although in some cases this may require  a  judge  to  explore
         whether the duty requires further information  to  be  obtained  or
         inquiry to be made, the judge primarily acts on the evidence in the
         case. Where that evidence gives no hint of a  suggestion  that  the
         welfare of the child is threatened by the immigration  decision  in
         question,  or  that  the  child's  best  interests  are  undermined
         thereby, there is no basis for any further judicial exploration  or
         reasoned decision on the matter.
         (4)  Even if a decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involves  the
         making of an error on a point of law, in deciding whether to  grant
         permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, it is relevant  whether
         there are any reasonable prospects of that Tribunal exercising  its
         powers to re-make the  decision  in  a  different  way.  The  Upper
         Tribunal is unlikely to do so if the error was marginal  and  would
         not have made a difference to the outcome.
         (5)  It is incompatible  with  the  overriding  objective  and  the
         scheme of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  to
         permit a rule 25 reply to open up fundamentally  different  grounds
         of appeal for which permission has not been granted."

28. I find on consideration of the decision that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had no regard for these now well-established principles and  thus
    the  assessment  of  the  best  interests  of  the  children  and   the
    reasonableness of expecting them to leave the UK  was  flawed,  without
    adequate reasoning and overlooked relevant factors.

29. At �73 and �75 the judge found that C3 and C4 were settled  in  the  UK
    "and it would be harmful and disproportionate" for them to  be  removed
    and certainly not in their best interest. At �81 the judge  found  that
    the removal of  the  children  would  be  "quite  disproportionate  and
    utterly harmful to their future development and  that  readjustment  to
    life in Pakistan would be quite  disproportionate."  In  reaching  that
    conclusion the judge had failed to take into account that the  children
    would be returning with  their  parents  and  that  family  life  would
    continue together in Pakistan. The judge appeared to give no weight  to
    the fact that the claimants had only temporary status  in  the  UK  and
    from 2009 had no status at all. They had no right  to  remain  her  and
    raise yet another child, taking advantage of British  health  care  and
    education to which they were not entitled. The claimants including  the
    children are citizens of Pakistan not the UK and not British.  Although
    listed as part of the submissions on behalf of the Secretary  of  State
    it is clear that no  consideration  of  these  factors  was  made  when
    weighing the reasonableness of whether the child  claimants  should  be
    expected to leave the UK under 276ADE.

30. The judge appeared to have  given  no  weight  in  any  proportionality
    exercise to the public interest in maintaining immigration control.  At
    �87 the judge made the rather odd remark that the  respondent  had  not
    claimed that 'entry clearance' would be  detrimental  to  the  economic
    wellbeing of the United Kingdom. Both case law and now statute (section
    117B came into force from 28.7.14 and thus not applicable to the  error
    of law considerations) have made it clear that immigration  control  is
    in the public interest. The judge seems to have relied on this peculiar
    observation to conclude that  it  could  not  be  maintained  that  the
    decision is not a disproportionate interference with private and family
    life. Quite apart from the fact that the  decision  had  no  effect  on
    family life, as they would be removed together, it  was  obviously  the
    Secretary of State's case that the decision was proportionate.  In  the
    circumstances such article 8 assessment as there may have been was on a
    flawed basis.

31. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings of fact and the  conclusions
    from those facts. Where the facts and conclusions therefrom are unclear
    on crucial issues at the heart of an appeal, as they are in this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of those issues.

32. In all the circumstances, the correct course is to relist  this  appeal
    for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I do so  on  the  basis
    that this is a case which falls squarely within the Senior  President's
    Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The effect of the error  has  been
    to deprive the appellant of a fair  hearing  and  that  the  nature  or
    extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary for the decision
    in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the
    overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly  and  justly,
    including with the avoidance of delay, I find that it is appropriate to
    remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to  determine  the  appeal
    afresh.



Conclusions:

33. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of a number of errors
    on a point of law such that the decision cannot stand and should be set
    aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to  be
                    made afresh with no findings preserved.

Directions

1. The appeal is to be relisted on a date to be fixed before the  First-tier
Tribunal at Bradford;
2. The time estimate is 3 hours;
3. The appeal is to be made afresh with no findings of fact preserved;
4. The appeal may be listed before any First-tier Tribunal Judge,  with  the
exception of Judge Robson.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeals remains to be decided,  thus  there  can
be no fee award.
