For the respondent:          Ms A. Fujiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity should be granted because the case  involves  issues  relating  to
the welfare of children in the UK. Unless and  until  a  tribunal  or  court
directs otherwise, the appellants are granted anonymity. No report of  these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify  them  or  any  member  of
their family. This direction applies both  to  the  appellants  and  to  the
respondent.

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.    The appellants appealed against the respondent's  decision  to  refuse
    to issue residence cards recognising a permanent right of residence  as
    the family members of an EEA national.

2.    The appellants are French citizens. They came to  the  UK  with  their
    parents in 2008. The appellants were refused residence cards  alongside
    their parents in decisions dated 11 December 2016.  The respondent  was
    not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to show that  the  EEA
    national sponsor had been residing in accordance with  The  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations  2006")
    for a continuous period of five years  or  that  there  was  sufficient
    evidence to show that the other applicants were  his  'family  members'
    within the meaning of the regulations.

3.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Anstis ("the judge") allowed the appeals  of
    the  appellants'  parents  (EA/00148/2017  &  EA/00550/2017).  He   was
    satisfied  that  there  was  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that   the
    appellants' father had acquired a right of permanent residence. He  was
    also satisfied that the translation of  the  marriage  certificate  was
    sufficient to show that their mother was his 'family member'.  However,
    he dismissed the children's appeals for the following reasons:

            "39. The position  is,  however,  different  for  the  remaining
           Appellants. Despite being specifically mentioned as  missing  in
           the refusal letter, and despite a translation  of  the  marriage
           certificate  having  been   produced,   there   are   no   birth
           certificates in  the  Appellants'  bundle,  nor  are  there  any
           alternative documents providing the relationship, and  there  is
           no explanation for the absence of these documents. At least  one
           of the Appellants was born in the United Kingdom,  and  even  if
           there may be difficulties with birth certificates for the others
           then a copy of that birth certificate ought to be available  and
           accessible to the Appellants."

4.    The appellants applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
    attaching, for the first time, translations of birth records  from  the
    French family book (but not a copy of the  original  document).  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Page granted permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal in the following terms:

           ".... The application for  permissions  to  appeal  states  that
           their family documents translated into  French  were  available,
           but were missing from what was before the judge. It may be  that
           there was evidence that could have satisfied the judge that  the
           appellants were related to their parents  as  claimed  but  that
           evidence was not before the judge for whatever reason. It may be
           that there has been a defect of a procedural nature  that  could
           give  rise  to  a  differently  constituted  Tribunal  taking  a
           different view of the evidence. In  the  circumstances  fairness
           dictates that permission to appeal should be granted."


5.    We are conscious of the fact that  the  appellants  do  not  have  the
    benefit of legal representation.

6.    The role of the Upper Tribunal is to consider whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision involved the making of an error  of  law.  The  Upper
    Tribunal will only consider new evidence  if  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision is set aside because the judge made a mistake in  the  law  or
    there was a procedural error.

7.    It is clear from our conversation with ZH at the  hearing  that  there
    is further evidence relating to the children's dates of  birth  in  the
    form of a French family book (and a translation). It is likely that the
    evidence was with the appellants at the hearing before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, but it is clear the family book was not given to the judge to
    consider. The appellants prepared a large bundle  of  evidence,  but  a
    copy of the family book and the translation was  not  included  in  the
    bundle.

8.    The judge cannot  be  criticised  for  failing  to  make  findings  on
    evidence that was not given to him to consider. Nor could it be  argued
    that the judge made a procedural error if the evidence was not shown to
    him at the hearing. The reasons for refusal letter made clear that  the
    birth certificates of the children were missing. Even if the appellants
    were unrepresented, it would have been clear that this evidence  needed
    to be produced in support of the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.
    The fact that the appellants have now been able to produce the evidence
    does not  disclose  any  errors  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision. We are  forced  to  conclude  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision did not involve the making of any errors of law and there  was
    no procedural unfairness.


Observations on the evidence

9.    These observations do not form  part  of  the  decision  and  are  not
    binding on the respondent.  However,  it  seems  clear  that  there  is
    evidence that would address the reasons for  refusal.  A  copy  of  the
    family book and the translation is now on  the  Home  Office  file.  Ms
    Fujiwala  accepted  that  this  further  evidence  was  likely  to   be
    sufficient for the youngest three children. Ms Fujiwala said  that  the
    best way for this evidence to be considered would be by way of a  fresh
    application for residence cards.

10.   It is accepted that the parents have acquired  a  right  of  permanent
    residence. They have been issued with residence cards since the  First-
    tier Tribunal decision. It is a matter for the respondent  whether  she
    chooses to exercise discretion to issue residence cards to the rest  of
    the family based on the evidence on file. If she chooses  not  to,  the
    appellants  will  need  to  make  fresh  applications  with  supporting
    evidence. To assist  the  respondent  to  decide  whether  to  exercise
    discretion, or the appellants to make a fresh application, we note  the
    following evidence is now on file.
