                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Hague made following a hearing at Bradford on 12th December 2013.





Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan who applied for  leave  to  enter
    the UK as a spouse.  He was  refused  on  28th  February  2013  on  the
    grounds that the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that he  was
    in a subsisting relationship with his wife, and on the grounds that  he
    had  previously  contrived  in  a  significant  way  to  frustrate  the
    intentions of the Rules by being an illegal entrant, with reference  to
    paragraph 320(11) of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The judge heard oral evidence from the Sponsor  whom  he  found  to  be
    entirely credible and he allowed the appeal in respect of  both  issues
    raised by the Entry Clearance Officer.

 4. The judge wrote as follows:

         "Mrs  Burrows  (the  Presenting  Officer)  sought  leave  to  raise
         maintenance as a new issue.  She acknowledged  that  the  Sponsor's
         earnings  from  the  two  jobs   were  sufficient  to  satisfy  the
         financial requirement at the time of the decision but  pointed  out
         that for the restaurant job the Sponsor had only produced  payslips
         and had not  shown  the  money  being  paid  into  her  account  as
         required."

 5. The judge stated that this  was  not  an  issue  raised  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and "as it amounts to no more than  objection  on  an
    evidential technicality only I declined to consider the argument."

 6. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the claimant could not succeed unless  the  mandatory  requirements  of
    Appendix  FM-SE  were  met.   The  Rules  of  specified  evidence   are
    comprehensively set out in the Appendices setting  out  what  types  of
    evidence are required, the periods  they  cover  and  the  format  they
    should be in.  The Tribunal had had no regard to this which is  clearly
    more than a technicality.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge  Manuell  for  the
    reasons stated in the grounds on 20th January 2014.

Submissions

 8. Mr Diwnycz relied on his grounds and submitted that, in reliance on  RM
    (Kwok-on-Tong: HC 395 para 320) India 2006 UKAIT 00039, the  Presenting
    Officer was right to raise an issue  when  it  became  clear  that  the
    requirements of the Rules could not be met.

 9. He produced the Presenting Officer's note of the hearing which reads as
    follows:

         "The IJ did not ask the parties whether there were any  preliminary
         issues and it was an error on my part  that  I  did  not  interrupt
         proceedings to introduce the issue of maintenance.

         I only realised my error during  oral  evidence  and  pointed  this
         issue out to the IJ and the rep.  The IJ  was  initially  happy  to
         take evidence on this point but later became extremely annoyed when
         I pointed out that the requirements of Appendix FM-SE had not  been
         met.

         He  then  stated  that  he  was  not  prepared  to  let  me  ambush
         proceedings in this way (I would have had some sympathy had he said
         this from the start) and in any case Appendix FM-SE had less weight
         than other parts of the Immigration Rules.

         He said that as far as he was concerned the  oral  evidence  showed
         that they could meet the �18,600 and it did not  matter  that  they
         had not produced the documentary evidence and he would hear no more
         about the issue."

10. Mr Diwnycz submitted that since the specified  evidence  had  not  been
    produced the appeal could not succeed.

11. Mr Janjua initially submitted that the point had not been raised by the
    Presenting  Officer  until  submissions.   He  said  that  all  of  the
    documentary evidence in  relation  to  the  Sponsor's  second  job  was
    available and provided to the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  who  had  not
    raised any issue on it.  The Sponsor earned �19,858, above the required
    level of �18,600, and  so  far  as  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was
    concerned, she had met the evidential requirements of the  Rules  which
    is why it had not been raised.

12. Mr Janjua then accepted that the evidential requirements had  not  been
    and could not be met since the money from the second job was  not  paid
    into the bank account, and although personal bank statements  had  been
    produced showing the salary from the first job, they could not show the
    salary from the second since she was paid in cash.

Findings and conclusions

13. Appendix FM sets out clearly the evidential requirements of the  Rules.
    In respect of salaried employment  in  the  UK  all  of  the  following
    evidence must be provided:

    (i)  The P60 for the relevant period or periods  of  employment  relied
         on, if issued.

    (ii) Wage slips covering..... any period of salaried employment in  the
         period of twelve months prior to the date  of  application  if  the
         applicant has been employed by their current employer for less than
         six months.

    (iii)    A letter from the employer who issued the payslips.

    (iv) A signed contract of employment for employment currently held.

    (v)  Monthly personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period
         as the wage slips at paragraph (ii) showing  that  the  salary  has
         been paid into an account in the name of the person or in the  name
         of the person and their partner jointly.

14. It was not open to the judge to decline to allow the Presenting Officer
    to raise the issue as to whether the Rules could be met.   The  correct
    approach would have been to allow the request, if necessary  permitting
    Mr Janjua the opportunity of an adjournment in order  to  consider  the
    issue.

15. Accordingly he was in error and the decision is set aside.

16. It seems that it is accepted by the Secretary of State's representative
    that the Sponsor does earn the money which she claims to earn, no issue
    having been taken with the authenticity of the payslips.  That is above
    the level of income specified in the Rules.  However it  is  unarguable
    that she did not meet the evidential  requirements  of  the  Rules  and
    accordingly the appeal has to be dismissed.

Decision

17. The original judge erred in law and his decision  is  set  aside.   The
    following decision is substituted.  The claimant's appeal  against  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer is dismissed.
