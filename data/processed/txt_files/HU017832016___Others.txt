For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Zahed promulgated on 10 May 2017,  in  which  the  Appellants'  appeals
    against the decisions to refuse their applications for entry  clearance
    to the United Kingdom dated 5 November 2015  were  dismissed  on  human
    rights grounds.

 2. The Appellants are nationals of Grenada, who are  mother  and  her  two
    children born on [ ] 1974, [ ] 1997 and [  ]  2004  respectively.   The
    Appellants sought entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  to  join  the
    Sponsor, [MS], the first Appellant's husband and the second  and  third
    Appellant's father.

 3. The Respondent refused  the  applications  on  5  November  2015  under
    paragraph E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  which
    required the Sponsor to have a gross income of  at  least  �24,800  per
    annum, on the basis  that  specified  evidence  of  self-employment  as
    required in paragraph 7(a), (b)(ii), (d), (e) and (f) of Appendix FM-SE
    had not been submitted with the  application.   The  Respondent  stated
    that the Appellants were invited  to  submit  additional  documents  to
    rectify the omission, but nothing further was provided.

 4. The Appellants provided further documents with their notice  of  appeal
    (having denied receipt of any  earlier  invitation  to  submit  further
    documents) and relied upon Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.  On review, an Entry  Clearance  Manager  maintained  the
    refusals on 18 August 2016.  In so doing, it was noted that all of  the
    specified evidence had now been provided  apart  from  bank  statements
    covering the whole financial year from 6 April 2014 to  5  April  2015.
    In any event, the documents showed the Sponsor's net profit from  self-
    employment to be �19,217 for the financial year 2014/15 which was  less
    than the required amount  under  Appendix  FM.   The  refusal  was  not
    considered to be in breach of Article 8 of the European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.

 5. Judge Zahed dismissed the appeals in a decision promulgated on  10  May
    2017 on the basis that the minimum income requirement  in  Appendix  FM
    was not met such that the Appellants could not meet the requirements of
    the  Immigration  Rules  and  further,  that  the  refusal  was  not  a
    disproportionate interference with their right to  respect  for  family
    life under Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  as
    family life could continue with visits as it had done to date.

The appeal

 6. The Appellants appealed on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal erred
    in its  conclusion  that  the  minimum  earnings  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules had not been satisfied and erred in  concluding  that
    there was no disproportionate interference with family life contrary to
    Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights  taking  into
    account the best interests of the children  under  section  55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

 7. In relation to the Immigration Rules, it was specifically claimed  that
    the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  equating  net  profit  from  self-
    employment with gross earnings, the correct figure to use for this  was
    the Sponsor's turnover of his business (which was in excess of �63,000)
    and that in any event, by the date of the hearing, there  was  evidence
    before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  Sponsor's  net  profit  was
    �25,300, which exceeded the minimum earnings requirement for  the  year
    2015/16.  In the alternative, the grounds of appeal  claimed  (i)  that
    the First-tier Tribunal erred in failing to  consider  separately  that
    the minimum earnings requirement had been met for the First  Appellant;
    and (ii) that following MM (Lebanon) v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department  [2017]  UKSC  10,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  should   have
    considered other potential earnings or finance for the family  to  meet
    the requirements.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Davies on 8 December 2017  on
    all grounds.

 9. At the hearing, Counsel for the Appellants relied on all of the written
    grounds of appeal, but accepted that for a person who is self-employed,
    their net profit  is  their  gross  income  for  the  purposes  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

10. The Home Office Presenting Officer submitted that the  only  ground  of
    appeal with any  strength  was  in  relation  to  whether  the  minimum
    earnings requirement had been met and accepted that  she  was  in  some
    difficulty  given  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  expressly
    consider or refer to the latest tax return showing  earnings  over  the
    minimum level in the decision.   It  was  accepted  that  the  relevant
    documents showing this were before the First-tier Tribunal and the Home
    Office Presenting Officer confirmed that there were no  further  issues
    of, for example, supporting specified evidence  in  relation  to  these
    earnings.

Findings and reasons

 1. Judge Zahed erred in law in  failing  to  take  into  account  evidence
    before him of the Sponsor's earnings in  the  financial  year  2015/16,
    which showed net profit from self-employment of �25,300  which  was  in
    excess of the minimum earnings requirement in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  That  evidence  was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal at the date of hearing but not referred to  at  all
    in the decision.  The statement in paragraph 4 of the decision that the
    Judge had taken all the documents into account in reaching his decision
    was wholly insufficient.

 2. The failure to meet the minimum earnings requirement (in substance) was
    the only outstanding reason for refusal under the Immigration Rules  by
    the time of the appeals, as shown  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager's
    Review statement and confirmed by the Home Office Presenting Officer at
    the hearing before me.  The First-tier Tribunal was  entitled  to  take
    into account evidence arising after the date of the decision and  erred
    in failing to do so in these appeals.  As I have found an error of  law
    in failing to take into account relevant material, it is not  necessary
    to consider  the  first  ground  of  appeal  as  set  out  in  the  two
    alternatives relied upon by the Appellants.

 3. The failure of  Judge  Zahed  to  find  that  the  Appellants  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules led to a material error of law in
    his assessment of their right to respect for private  and  family  life
    under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.   The  fact
    that the Appellants met the requirements of the Immigration Rules for a
    grant of entry clearance means that the refusal can  not,  contrary  to
    the findings of Judge Zahed, be a proportionate interference  with  the
    right to respect family life for the  purpose  of  the  maintenance  of
    immigration control.   There  is  no  substantive  public  interest  in
    maintaining the refusals when the requirements of the Immigration Rules
    have been met.  Judge Zahed therefore erred in law  in  conducting  the
    balancing exercise required under Article 8 of the European  Convention
    on Human Rights and concluding that the appeals should be dismissed  on
    human rights grounds.  That was a material error of law  affecting  the
    outcome of the appeals and it is necessary to set aside the decision.

 4. The parties agreed at the hearing that if an error of law was found, it
    would be appropriate for me to remake the  decision  on  the  basis  of
    information before me and without the need for a further hearing.   For
    the reasons already given above, the Appellants' appeals are allowed on
    human rights grounds.  In  circumstances  where  there  is  documentary
    evidence that the Sponsor meets the minimum  earnings  requirements,  I
    find that the Appellants meet the requirements of  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1
    of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  Further, where  there  is  no
    evidence before me to the contrary and the Respondent does not maintain
    the refusals of entry clearance on any other grounds, it  would  follow
    that the Appellants meet all of the relevant requirements for grants of
    entry clearance as the spouse/children of a person present and  settled
    in the United Kingdom under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 5. There is no dispute in the present  appeals  that  family  life  exists
    between the Appellants and Sponsor and the refusal of  entry  clearance
    interferes with such family life, particularly their  ability  to  live
    together as a family unit.   Although  the  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance is in accordance with the law, it is not in  accordance  with
    the Immigration Rules and  as  such,  it  is  neither  necessary  in  a
    democratic society for one of the specified interests in Article  8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights, nor would it in any  event  be
    proportionate to any such legitimate  aim.   There  is  no  substantive
    public interest in refusing entry clearance to  persons  who  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for a grant  of  entry  clearance
    where family life exists.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

The appeals are allowed on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
