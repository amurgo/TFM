Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr A Malik of Counsel instructed by Malik Law
Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I see no need for, and do not  make,  an  order  restricting  reporting
    about this appeal.

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing an  appeal  by  the  present  Respondents,
    hereinafter  "the  Claimants",  against  the  decision  of  the   Entry
    Clearance Officer, Islamabad,  now  represented  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, refusing them entry clearance to the United Kingdom.

 3. The problem is that, according to the Secretary  of  State,  the  First
    Claimant did not earn quite enough money  to  satisfy  the  rule.   The
    critical  paragraph  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  determination  is
    paragraph 18 where the  judge  says  that,  in  order  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Rules, the First Claimant has to show an income  of
    �29,600 but he could only manage to show an income �29,041.

 4. The judge explained her difficulty at paragraph 17 when she was looking
    for a definition of gross annual income in the Rules and could not find
    one either by her own  researches  or  with  the  assistance  of  those
    appearing for the parties before her.

 5. She said at paragraph 17:

         "I therefore take the view that 'gross annual income'  is  to  read
         exactly what it says; that is to say the  entirety  of  the  annual
         income from self-employment on a gross basis before any  deductions
         for any expenses or allowances".

 6. This would be very remarkable if in fact it was right and Ms  Isherwood
    before me said simply that it is not right.  She  produced  a  printout
    from the Rules headed "Calculating Gross Annual Income  Under  Appendix
    FM". The critical point is at paragraph 19 where under (b) it states:

         "Where  the  self-employed  person  is  a  sole  trader  or  is  in
         partnership or franchise agreement, the income will be:

         (i)  the gross taxable profits from their share  of  the  business;
         and

         (ii) allowances or deductible expenses which are not taxed will not
         be counted towards income"

 7. In other words the Rules do in fact state what they might  be  expected
    to state which is that in the case of a self-employed person the  gross
    income is not important, it is the gross taxable profit  that  matters.
    It is a pity the mistake was made by an experienced judge but  she  was
    responding to the submissions before her.

 8. Mr Malik had no answer to Ms Isherwood's submission.

 9. I have to say on this occasion the Judge was wrong and I set aside  the
    decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I  substitute  a  decision
    dismissing the appeal against the Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision.






    Notice of Decision

    The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.  I  substitute  a  decision
    dismissing the appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision.
