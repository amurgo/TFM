For the Appellant:     Ms S. Alban, Fountain Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. K. Hibbs, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  1. This is an appeal by BIZ against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
     Judge Trevaskis, promulgated on 20 March 2017, in  which  he  dismissed
     BIZ's appeal against the Secretary of State's  decision  to  refuse  to
     grant asylum.


  2. As this is an asylum appeal, I make an anonymity direction,  continuing
     that made in the First-tier Tribunal.


  3. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal as follows:


     "In relation to Ground 1, it is clear that the Judge was  referring  to
     "implausibility" as in reality meaning "incredibility".  His finding at
     [41] is sustainable.  In terms of Ground 2, such  Ground  has  arguable
     merit.  With reference to Ground 3,  it  is  arguable  that  the  Judge
     failed to take into account material evidence which was before him,  as
     referred to.  Permission is granted on Grounds 2 and 3 only."


  4. On a renewed application, permission  to  appeal  was  granted  on  all
     grounds by the Upper Tribunal as follows:


     "It is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal  may  have  erred  in  its
     approach to the plausibility of the appellant's  account,  when  viewed
     together with the other findings of fact (to  which  grounds  2  and  3
     relate) and it is appropriate for  permission  to  be  granted  on  all
     grounds."

The hearing


  5. The Appellant attended the hearing.   I  heard  submissions  from  both
     representatives following which I reserved my decision.


Submissions


  6. Ms Alban relied on the grounds of appeal  and  the  skeleton  argument.
     This contained a fourth ground,  "failure  to  consider  the  objective
     evidence".  Ms Alban submitted  that  this  ground  merely  embellished
     Grounds 1 to 3.


  7. Mr. Hibbs relied on the  Rule  24  response.   He  submitted  that  the
     grounds were no more than a  disagreement  with  the  findings  of  the
     judge.  In relation to Ground 1,  the  judge  was  not  comparing  what
     happened in the UK to what happened across the rest of  the  world  but
     was saying that he did not find it credible  that  the  photograph,  if
     fake, would have been uploaded onto the website.  It was not a case  of
     the judge applying UK  or  western  standards.   He  did  not  find  it
     credible that an NGO would allow  its  website  to  be  corrupted.   He
     questioned why, if the agent had been so good that he had uploaded  the
     photograph, the Appellant had not mentioned it.  At [41] the judge  was
     not saying that he found it unbelievable that  an  NGO  could  have  an
     element of corruption and facilitate a fraudulent application.  He  did
     not make such any comment about the NGO and  this  was  to  misconstrue
     what the judge had said.


  8. Regarding the Appellant living close to the border he  questioned  why,
     if it had been safe at the border, the Appellant  had  left.   In  this
     respect, the judge had  given  full  consideration  to  the  background
     evidence.  I was referred to page 140 of the bundle before  the  First-
     tier Tribunal.  Looking at the  Appellant's  case  in  the  round,  the
     Appellant had left Burkina Faso on his own passport without any issues.
      He had lived in Burkina Faso for some time  without  encountering  any
     problems.


  9. In relation to Ground 2 and the payslips,  without  more,  the  judge's
     findings were open to him.  He commented that they  were  generic  [37]
     but could not be held to be in error in making this  finding.   Further
     there was no evidence before the judge as to how the payslips  and  the
     contract had come into the Appellant's possession.  He  questioned  why
     the Appellant would have had a formal contract if he were  being  asked
     to smuggle arms.


 10. In relation to the point about  the  Appellant's  refusal  to  arm  his
     employer's supporters [39] this was a minor point with  no  bearing  on
     the decision as a whole.


 11. I was referred to [43].  The judge had made  a  finding  regarding  the
     Appellant's answers at his interview.  At Q55 the Appellant had said he
     had lived in two  places.   The  judge  had  carefully  considered  the
     background evidence and made his finding at [43].  At  [45]  the  judge
     considered the  delay  in  claiming  asylum.   He  questioned  why  the
     Appellant had been to the games in Glasgow if he were not part  of  the
     team, and why he had then travelled from Glasgow to  Swansea  to  claim
     asylum.


 12. In response, regarding Ground 1 Ms Alban submitted that the  judge  had
     used the word "plausible" and in the  context  it  did  not  equate  to
     "credible".  The judge was saying that he did not find the  Appellant's
     account "possible", and that it was not plausible that an NGO would  be
     corrupt.  She submitted that it was possible for an NGO to put  players
     in a team who were paying to leave the country.  They would have to put
     photographs up on the website and  ask  the  Appellant  to  attend  the
     tournament in order that they were not found out.  Following  the  case
     of HK [2006] EWCA Civ it was inappropriate to consider the plausibility
     of the account by UK standards.  Corruption was wide in Africa.


 13. Regarding the fact that the Appellant was able  to  remain  in  Burkina
     Faso until 2016, the judge failed to have regard to  his  account  that
     first he moved to another city, and then moved to a  village  near  the
     border.  The president had tried to change the constitution in 2014 and
     the Appellant had moved to another city under  the  protection  of  the
     guards.  When the presidential guards were disbanded he  had  moved  to
     the village.  The objective evidence supported  his  account.   It  was
     consistent that he could have stayed near the border.


 14. Regarding Ground 2, the original documents  had  been  provided.   This
     included two court summons.  The judge had failed to give them adequate
     weight.  He had attached limited weight  to  them  at  [37]  and  [44].
     Burkina Faso was a very small country and it was not possible to get an
     expert to authenticate the documents.  I was referred to the case of JK
     v Sweden 59166/12 23 August 2016 (CG), [91]  to  [98].   The  documents
     were significant in proving  his  account,  and  therefore  the  burden
     shifted to the Respondent to show that they should not  be  relied  on.
     The Respondent had not attempted to do this.


 15. Further, the judge had said that limited weight should be  attached  to
     the documents, not no weight.  However, he failed to place  any  weight
     on the documents at all.  He had not considered whether  the  Appellant
     would be at risk because of the documents.


 16. Regarding Ground 3, the errors of fact were material.   The  judge  had
     relied on them and they had affected his credibility finding.   He  had
     erred at [38] in finding  that  the  Appellant's  tasks  were  "largely
     menial".  It was the Appellant's evidence that he was  highly  involved
     in political activities.  I was referred to Q13, Q46, Q47, Q49 and  Q50
     of  the  asylum  interview.   This  made  a  big  difference.   If  the
     Appellant's tasks had been only menial he would not be at risk, but  he
     had been highly involved in political activities.


 17. At [39] the judge had erred in  finding  that,  if  the  Appellant  had
     refused to carry out a task, he would not have continued to  live  with
     his employer.  This was not his account at all.  I was referred to  Q50
     of the asylum interview, and to [6] of his witness statement.


 18. Regarding Ground 4 as set out in the skeleton, the  objective  evidence
     supported the Appellant's account regarding why he left the  city,  and
     when he left the city to go to the village.  The judge had not accepted
     the Appellant's account,  but  the  objective  evidence  supported  the
     account given at interview.  The judge had failed  to  have  regard  to
     this objective evidence.


Error of law decision


 19. I will turn first to Ground 3.  At [38] the judge states:


     "He describes the nature of the tasks undertaken  by  him,  which  were
     largely menial, and which do not indicate a high level  of  involvement
     in the political activities of his employer."


 20. I was referred to the asylum interview, Q13, Q46, Q47, Q49 and Q50.  At
     Q13 the Appellant stated that his employer was using young  people  for
     his political campaign.  The Appellant used to arrange events where his
     boss could meet these young people.  He used to get  the  young  people
     together, and to give people bribes.  At Q46 he described  how  he  had
     been asked by his boss to go to various  districts  and  speak  to  the
     young people that his boss wanted to meet.  At  Q47  he  said  that  he
     started doing more than just organising the youth for his boss in  2012
     or 2013.  At Q49 he described how he used to "take an envelope  with  2
     million CFA francs and a new motorbike and give it to the youth  leader
     in that district and get him to see Fran�ois".  He  explained  how  the
     money was to buy the youth because "the  young  generation  until  2013
     didn't like Fran�ois".  At Q50 he was asked how often  he  would  carry
     out these errands and he described how once the link  was  established,
     the group would come back with further demands.

 21. The judge has described the Appellant's claim  as  being  that  he  was
     employed doing "largely menial" tasks for  his  employer.   However,  I
     find that the judge has erred in stating that the tasks  undertaken  by
     the Appellant were "largely menial".  The Appellant has  not  described
     them as such.  In his asylum interview the Appellant described  how  he
     was involved in arranging youth meetings, and how he would  pay  bribes
     in order to get people to attend these meetings.   The  judge  has  not
     stated that he does  not  find  the  account  set  out  in  the  asylum
     interview credible, but has characterised the tasks undertaken  by  the
     Appellant as "largely menial" which is not the account as  set  out  by
     the Appellant.  Given that the judge has not rejected this  account,  I
     find that he has erred in this finding that the tasks did not  indicate
     a high level of involvement in political activities.   The  Appellant's
     account is that he was involved  in  mobilising  the  youth,  including
     bribing them to attend political meetings.


 22. The second mistake of fact to which Ground 2 refers is  at  [39].   The
     judge states:


     "He has claimed, and later denied, that he left his employment  because
     he refused to arm supporters of his employer.  He  then  said  that  he
     went into hiding in 2 properties owned by his employer; I find this  to
     be inconsistent with his claim to have  disobeyed  an  order  from  his
     employer."


 23. At Q50 of his asylum interview, the Appellant said  that  his  employer
     had asked for some batons and machetes  to  be  bought  to  attack  the
     population.  He was asked whether this materialised, and his  reply  is
     recorded as "no I didn't do that.  I switched off  my  phone  and  went
     back home."  At paragraph 6 of his statement, in reply to  the  reasons
     refusal letter, he stated:


     "With regards to paragraph 20, I didn't say that the reason  I  stopped
     running the errands was because I was told to buy machetes and  batons.
     I didn't have to run the errands because  people  started  to  come  to
     listen to Blaise.  The reason I left my residence and went to  stay  in
     Bobo Dioulasso was because the public were getting  aggressive  against
     people associated with Fran�ois and  Blaise  and  houses  were  getting
     burnt so I wanted to protect myself.   I  didn't  refuse  to  run  this
     errand.  When I was asked, I didn't say anything and I  went  home  and
     didn't do anything and turned my phone off.  Following this,  the  vote
     for the referendum was on the 30 October 2014 so I didn't see  Fran�ois
     so he could not ask me whether I bought the batons or not."


 24. The judge has made a finding that the Appellant's claim is inconsistent
     on the basis that, had he refused  to  carry  out  an  order  from  his
     employer, he would not then have gone into  hiding  in  two  properties
     owned by his employer.  However, the Appellant's evidence at his asylum
     interview was not that he had refused to carry  out  this  order,  just
     that he had not done it.  He then  expanded  on  this  in  his  witness
     statement.  The Appellant has provided an explanation  to  address  the
     Respondent's allegation that he stopped running  errands  when  he  was
     asked to buy batons,  but  the  judge  has  made  a  finding  that  the
     Appellant "claimed, and later  denied"  that  he  left  his  employment
     because he refused to arm supporters.  I find that the Appellant  never
     claimed to have left his employment because he  refused  to  carry  out
     this order.   I find that the judge has misstated another part  of  the
     Appellant's evidence at [39].


 25. It was submitted by Mr. Hibbs that the point regarding the  refusal  to
     arm his employer's supporters was a minor point, with no bearing on the
     decision as a whole.  I have considered whether  the  two  mistakes  of
     fact in [38] and [39] are material.  I find that at [38] the judge  has
     made a mistake of fact in relation to  the  basis  of  the  Appellant's
     claim.  The Appellant claimed at  his  asylum  interview  that  he  was
     politically involved arranging meetings on behalf of his  employer  and
     bribing people to attend them.  At [39] the judge has made a mistake of
     fact which  has  led  to  a  finding  that  the  Appellant's  claim  is
     inconsistent.


 26. I find that these mistakes of fact  are  material.   I  find  that  the
     nature of the tasks which the Appellant claimed to have carried out are
     material to his claim.  There is a  significant  difference  between  a
     claim to have carried out largely menial tasks, and  a  claim  to  have
     been involved in arranging political meetings  and  bribing  people  to
     attend them.  Further, I find that a finding of  inconsistency  in  the
     Appellant's evidence is material to a finding  as  to  the  Appellant's
     overall  credibility,  especially  given  the  judge  found  that  this
     evidence was relevant to the Appellant's ability to remain  in  Burkina
     Faso.  In paragraph [40] the judge finds that it is not plausible  that
     the Appellant  was  being  protected  in  hiding.   This  finding  must
     necessarily relate back to the finding of inconsistency at [39].


 27. In relation to Ground 2, it was open to the judge to decide what weight
     should be given to  the  documentary  evidence  but,  although  he  has
     attached limited weight to the documents, he does not  appear  to  have
     taken this limited weight into  account  when  assessing  the  risk  on
     return to the Appellant.  If he has given limited weight  to  summonses
     requesting him to attend the police, it is incumbent on him to  explain
     why, despite having attached some weight to these  documents,  they  do
     not create a risk on return.


 28. In relation to Ground 1, while the judge has  not  stated  that  it  is
     "unbelievable that an NGO could have an element of corruption and would
     facilitate a fraudulent visa application", he has found that it is  not
     plausible that a fake photograph would be uploaded from a website of  a
     bona fide NGO.  Even if he meant "credible" when he states "plausible",
     he has failed to explain why it is not plausible that a fake photograph
     would be uploaded from the website of the NGO.  He  has  simply  stated
     that it is not plausible without giving reasons.


 29. I find that the judge failed  to  take  into  account  the  Appellant's
     evidence given at his asylum interview and in his statement.  If he did
     take it into account, he has failed to give  reasons  for  why  he  has
     rejected that evidence, and why he has found that the Appellant's tasks
     were largely menial, or why he has found that the Appellant refused  to
     carry out an order.  He has stated that he is attaching limited  weight
     to the documents, including police summonses, but then in  the  overall
     assessment he has failed to attribute any weight to them.  Further,  he
     has failed to give reasons for why it would not be plausible for a fake
     photograph to be uploaded from the website.  Even if this was a finding
     that it was not credible, he has failed to give reasons  why.   I  find
     that these errors are material.


 30. I have taken account of the Practice Statement dated 10 February  2010,
     paragraph 7.2.  This contemplates that an appeal may be remitted to the
     First-tier Tribunal where the effect of the error has been to deprive a
     party before the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or  other
     opportunity for the party's case to be put to  and  considered  by  the
     First-tier Tribunal.  Given that the credibility findings are  infected
     by the errors, and therefore given the nature and extent of  the  fact-
     finding necessary to enable this appeal to be remade, having regard  to
     the overriding objective, I find that it is appropriate to  remit  this
     case to the First-tier Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

31. The appeal is allowed.  The decision involves the making of a  material
    error of law and I set the decision aside.

32. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
