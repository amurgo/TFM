                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Sowerby instructed by Thamina Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's refusal to
    grant him leave to remain on the basis of long residence,  pursuant  to
    paragraph 276B and paragraph 276D of the Immigration Rules HC  395  (as
    amended).  The appellant is a Bangladeshi citizen.

 2. The appellant entered the United  Kingdom  with  student  leave  on  30
    August 2008.  He has not had extant leave since 7 August 2013, when his
    Tier 4  leave  was  curtailed  on  ETS/TOEIC  grounds.   The  appellant
    contends that his leave was unlawfully and/or perversely curtailed  and
    that the interruption in his lawful  presence  in  the  United  Kingdom
    which ensued should be disregarded.

 3. On 15 December 2017 the appellant made an  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain on the basis of 10 years' lawful  residence.   On  that
    date, he had been in the United Kingdom for 9 years and 4  months.   He
    did not have the requisite 10 years'  residence  and  accordingly  this
    appeal never had any prospect of success.

 4. The appellant's argument about the application  of  paragraph  276B  in
    conjunction with paragraph 39E falls away by reason of the decision  in
    Ahmed v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 107.
     A chronology has  been  provided  which  makes  that  clear  beyond  a
    peradventure.  It is therefore not necessary for me  to  consider  what
    should have happened about the gap in the appellant's residence  caused
    by the curtailment on ETS TOEIC grounds  of  his  student  leave  on  7
    August 2013 and I make no finding on that.

 5. The appeal is dismissed and the First-tier Tribunal decision stands.

Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.
