                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Ms R Dassa, instructed by Wai Leung Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Sweeta Yousafzai, date of birth 1.4.81, is a  citizen  of
    Afghanistan.

 2. This  is  the  appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  the
    determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   McIntosh   promulgated
    16.9.14, allowing the claimant's appeal against  the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse her application for  entry  clearance
    to the United Kingdom as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration
    Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 13.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert granted permission to  appeal  (on  a
    date that is not decipherable from the decision).

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 6.1.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge McIntosh should be set aside.

 6. The application for entry clearance  was  made  on  the  basis  of  the
    claimant's marriage to Amin Ahmady, who has indefinite leave to  remain
    and is present and settled in the UK.

 7. The issue in the appeal was the financial requirements of Appendix  FM.
    The refusal decision makes clear that the Entry Clearance  Officer  was
    not satisfied that the sponsor is  employed  and  receives  the  salary
    claimed from either of his two employments. Reliance was placed on  the
    specified documentary evidence requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

 8. In allowing the appeal, at �21 to �22 professed to  be  satisfied  that
    that the sponsor had a combined salary exceeding the �18,600 threshold.
    However, the judge  made  no  reference  whatsoever  to  the  specified
    evidence requirements of Appendix FM-SE that  the  wages,  even  though
    paid in cash, have to be demonstrated to have been deposited in a  bank
    account matching the same period as the wage slips.

 9. The facts set out in the letters from the two employers  did  not  meet
    the requirements of FM-SE. However, the letters were amended and signed
    to include the specified evidence requirements, as explained at �14  of
    the decision. Mr Duffy took no further issue on that aspect.

10. In her skeleton argument, Ms  Dassa  accepted  that  the  claimant  was
    unable to meet the requirements of FM-SE 2(c), as the  wages  were  not
    paid into a bank account. It was also accepted that this is a mandatory
    requirement that was not complied with.

11. Ms Dassa was submitted  that  the  judge  had  the  power  to  use  his
    discretion to apply the evidential flexibility provisions of  paragraph
    D of Appendix FM-SE. However, in  Ukus  (discretion:  when  reviewable)
    [2012] UKUT 00307  (IAC),  the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that  where  the
    decision maker has failed to exercise a discretion vested in  him,  the
    Tribunal's jurisdiction on appeal is limited to  a  decision  that  the
    failure  renders  the  decision  'not  in  accordance  with   the   law
    (s86(3)(a)). Because the discretion is vested  in  the  Executive,  the
    appropriate course will be for the Tribunal  to  require  the  decision
    maker to complete his  task  by  reaching  a  lawful  decision  on  the
    outstanding  application.  It  is  clear  from  paragraph  D  that  the
    discretion in this case rests with  the  decision  maker  and  not  the
    Tribunal. There was no power of the  Tribunal  judge  to  exercise  the
    discretion to apply evidential flexibility provisions under paragraph D
    in place of the Secretary of State.

12. D(a) explains that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  will  consider  the
    documents  submitted  with  the  application  and  will  only  consider
    documents submitted after the application where  sub-paragraph  (b)  or
    (e) applies. Those provisions do not apply in this case. D(c)  explains
    that the decision-maker will not request documents where he or she does
    not anticipate that addressing the error or omission referred to in sub-
    paragraph (b) will lead to a grant  because  the  application  will  be
    refused for other reasons. As the sponsor had not deposited  the  wages
    into the bank account, there was no missing  documentation  that  could
    have been provided to cure the defect to demonstrate  that  wages  were
    paid into the account. There was no basis for the Secretary of State to
    even begin to consider exercising a discretion to either ask  for  more
    information or alternative verification.

13. It is a matter for the Entry Clearance Officer as to whether there is a
    valid reason as to why a specified document cannot  be  provided.  That
    there may be an explanation as to why wages were not deposited does not
    amount to a reason to dispense  with  the  requirement.  In  Sultana  &
    Others (rules: waiver/further  enquiry;  discretion)  [2014]  UKUT  540
    (IAC), the panel, including the President, held that  where  applicants
    wished to invoke any discretion of the kind covered  by  section  D  of
    Appendix  FM-SE,  "they  should  do  so  when   making   the   relevant
    application, highlighting the specific provision of the  Rules  invoked
    and the grounds upon which the exercise of  discretion  is  requested."
    There was no such request in this case and no basis for  the  Secretary
    of State to unilaterally exercise discretion.  The  specified  evidence
    requirement therefore stands. Even if  the  payment  is  in  cash,  the
    applicant has to show that the salary was paid into the bank account. A
    letter from the employer and/or wage slips is insufficient to meet  the
    requirement.

14. In her skeleton argument Ms Dassa submitted that as  the  Secretary  of
    State had requested an adjournment in order to obtain  evidence  as  to
    income  from  the  HMRC,  the  discretion  was  being  exercised  under
    paragraph D(e). Her argument was that  once  the  discretion  had  been
    exercised, it becomes open to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  determine
    whether a valid reason exists to prevent the sponsor meeting the  FM-SE
    requirements.

15. Whilst accepting, as I must, the finding in Sultana that a  refusal  to
    exercise a discretionary power may render a decision not in  accordance
    with the law, I do not accept Ms Dassa's  argument  that  exercising  a
    discretion  to  obtain  further  information,  even  if   it   can   be
    characterised as such, opens the door to the Tribunal to  review  other
    aspects  of  the  application  of  paragraph  D  and  to  exercise  the
    discretion on behalf of the Secretary of State in respect of  an  issue
    not the subject of an exercise of discretion. For the reasons  set  out
    above, the Tribunal has no power  to  exercise  such  a  discretion  in
    relation to paragraph D. The most that could be done would be to  allow
    the appeal on the limited basis that it remains for a  decision  to  be
    made that is in accordance with the law.  However, I  find  that  there
    was no basis for that course of action as there was no reason  why  the
    Secretary of State should have accepted the explanation for the failure
    to bank the wages paid in cash  into  the  bank  account.  It  was  not
    something which was impossible for the claimant to do; she failed to do
    so, perhaps because she was ignorant of the requirements of Appendix FM-
    SE.

16. The  fact  remains  that  the  appellant  could  not  comply  with  the
    requirement and nothing in that which has been  advanced  provides  any
    reason to justify the exercise of discretion to  disapply  this  strict
    requirement.  Neither  can  the  application  of  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE be unfair to the claimant. The  requirements  are  clear
    and could have been complied with. There  is  nothing  unfair  in  this
    case.

17. Article 8 was not raised in the grounds of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal and not  addressed  in  any  submissions
    before me. In the circumstances I do not address this issue.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside and remade.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
