                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Birk, promulgated on 18th August 2016,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 12th  August  2016.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Pakistan, who was born on  25th
    March 1987.  She appealed against the decision of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer dated 26th August 2014 refusing her  application  to  join  her
    sponsoring husband, Mr M. Hanif, a person present and  settled  in  the
    UK.  The applicable Immigration  Rules  are  paragraph  EC-P.1.1(b)  of
    Appendix FM.  The reasons for the refusal are that  the  Appellant  had
    not submitted an appropriate employer's letter.  When the decision  was
    reviewed by the ECM on 14th September 2015, the decision was upheld  on
    the basis that the information provided was still inadequate.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge heard evidence that the Sponsor, Mr Hanif, had  received  the
    employer's letter late, and when he received  it  he  took  it  to  the
    embassy straightaway.  Thereafter there is a second letter  dated  24th
    August 2014.  The first one did not have the precise details  necessary
    on it and so a second letter proved necessary.  In fact, he had sent in
    five letters in  total  but  none  of  these  had  been  accepted  (see
    paragraph 4).  The Respondent in reply stated that the 2013 letter  was
    not in evidence, but the second letter of 2014  still  did  not  comply
    with the requirements of paragraph  (b)(iii)  because  the  information
    required  still  was  not  submitted.   In   reply,   the   Appellant's
    representative submitted that at the hearing today there were now  P60s
    submitted and that "each P60 shows each and every time that the  salary
    was above the threshold" (paragraph 5).

 4. The judge held that the Appellant's Sponsor was  unable  to  produce  a
    copy  of  the  employer's  letter  as  required  under  Appendix  FM-SE
    A1.2.2(b).  It was true that subsequent letters had been produced  from
    the same employer.  However, no copy of  the  employer's  letter  dated
    2013 had been produced.  The Appellant's representative had  sought  to
    argue that the employer's  letter  did  not  contain  all  the  details
    initially, but if one looked at the later letter of 24th October  2014,
    it still did not  meet  all  of  the  requirements  in  Appendix  FM-SE
    A1.2.2(b)(iii).  The judge went on to say that

         "The refusal letter refers to there being no such employer's letter
         with the application.  On the basis that I have not seen a copy  of
         the 2013 letter, that the Sponsors accepts that the 2013 letter did
         not contain all the details required I am not able to find  that  a
         correctly formatted letter was more likely to have  been  submitted
         with the application ..." (paragraph 9).

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that it was wrong  for  the  judge  to
    conclude that the Sponsor had not included  all  the  details  required
    under Appendix FM, because all that had happened was that "it  was  not
    as verbose as the second letter" (see paragraph 5).   This  is  plainly
    wrong and  does  the  drafter  of  the  Grounds  of  Appeal  no  credit
    whatsoever.  It is wrong for the reasons that I will come to below.

 7. On 27th November 2016, permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis
    that the Sponsor's evidence regarding the letter of employment may have
    been misconstrued.

 8. On 8th February 2017, a Rule 24 response was entered by the  Respondent
    to  the  effect  that  the  judge  directed  himself  correctly.    The
    requirements in Appendix FM-SE are not a mere technicality.  They  have
    the same status as the Immigration Rules.  They  need  to  be  complied
    with.  The Appellant in this case had not complied with them.

The Hearing

 9. At the hearing before me Mr Khan, appearing on behalf of the Appellant,
    relied on the fact that, firstly, the judge had  at  the  time  of  the
    hearing before her, P60s for the Appellant going back five  years,  all
    of which showed that the Sponsor was well above the financial threshold
    requirement, and that the judge should have taken this into account  in
    reaching her conclusions.

10. Second, he submitted that the Sponsor had by now been able to  discover
    the 2013 letter from the employer.  He handed up a letter from "Metsec"
    dated 3rd December 2013.  This is signed off by Chris Groves, the wages
    administrator.  It reads  as  follows:  "Mr  Mohammed  Hanif  has  been
    employed by Metsec PLC since October 2006 as a general operative in our
    profile manipulation division.  This is a permanent position for  which
    his annual salary is �20,222".  However, Mr  Khan  accepted  that  this
    letter does not contain details about how long the Sponsor has been  on
    this salary of �20,222.  This information, he accepted, was  necessary,
    in order to root out fraud, so  that  potential  applicants  could  not
    simply get an employer of the Sponsor to  write  out  letters  such  as
    this, without it being properly stated how long the Sponsor was on such
    a salary for.  Mr Khan also accepted that the letter of  2013  had  not
    been sent to the ECO at the time of the decision.  He further  accepted
    that no P60 had been sent to the ECO either.

11. Third, Mr Khan then went on to submit that when the ECM  was  asked  to
    review the decision, this was done on  the  basis  of  a  "letter  from
    Sponsor's employer, but this was a reference to a  letter  subsequently
    written.  There was, however, here a reference to  a  "P60"  (see  sub-
    paragraph (e)).  That suggested only a reference to a single  P60.   At
    this stage, Mr Mills, for the Respondent, reminded Mr Khan that the P60
    here did not cover the correct tax year, such as to enable the  Sponsor
    to show that it was commensurate with the missing  information  in  the
    employer's letter.   Finally,  Mr  Khan  relied  upon  the  "evidential
    flexibility" Rule which applies in the Home Office's own guidelines  at
    "Appendix FM1.7: financial requirement (May 2016)".  Mr Khan took me to
    the section at paragraph 3.4.6  (at  page  12,  and  this  states  that



         "In deciding an application in  relation  to  which  this  Appendix
         states  that  specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer or the Secretary of State ('the decision  maker')
         will  consider  documents  that  have  been  submitted   with   the
         application, and will only consider documents submitted  after  the
         application where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies."

    Mr Khan went on to say that he would place reliance upon  sub-paragraph
    (dd) which reads, "a  document  which  does  not  contain  all  of  the
    specified information;".

12. For his part, Mr Mills  submitted  that  the  suggestion  that  it  was
    incumbent upon the Secretary of  State  to  invoke  sub-paragraph  (dd)
    requiring the decision maker to request  "a  document  which  does  not
    contain all of the specified information", every time such  information
    is missing, was absurd under the  evidential  flexibility  requirement.
    It was for the Appellant to  have  provided  the  necessary  employer's
    letter with the necessary information stipulated on  it.   The  failure
    was entirely that of  the  Appellant.   Indeed,  the  initial  decision
    letter by the ECO expressly stated that requests had been made for  the
    employer's letter and this had not been forthcoming.  However,  to  his
    credit, Mr Mills submitted that what the Appellant could rely  upon  is
    the requirement within the relevant  sub-paragraph  of  the  evidential
    flexibility Rules, which is to the effect that "a document in the wrong
    format" or "a document that is a copy and not an original document"  or
    "a document that does not contain all the specified information" may be
    recognised provided that the missing  information  is  verifiable  from
    other sources, such as other documents submitted with the  application,
    or the website of the organisation which issued the  document,  or  the
    website of the appropriate regulatory body.  In such a case,  Mr  Mills
    submitted, "the application may be granted exceptionally, providing the
    decision maker is satisfied that the document is genuine and  that  the
    applicant meets the requirements to which the  document  relates".   Mr
    Mills submitted that it would have been open  in  these  circumstances,
    given that the five years' P60s were placed before the Tribunal  judge,
    to have allowed the appeal exceptionally, because it  would  have  been
    plain to see that the salary of the Sponsor as claimed,  was  reflected
    in the manner alleged, ever since 2011.  Were a finding of an error  of
    law to be made, and the decision remade on this  basis,  so  as  to  be
    allowed for the Appellant, the Secretary of State  would  not  seek  to
    challenge that decision, given the circumstances.

Error of Law

13. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    decision on a point of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007) such that I
    should set aside the decision.  My reasons for so doing  are  that  the
    judge had before her P60s going  back  to  2011.   Two  of  these  P60s
    closest to the year 2013 would  have  sufficed  to  show  the  "missing
    information" from the numerous employer's letters which  the  Appellant
    submitted.  No doubt if he had been advised  properly,  he  would  have
    requested the employer to provide specifically what was required of the
    employer.  Although Appendix FM-SE had not  been  technically  complied
    with, the very same framework of Rules contained a  provision  for  the
    application of "evidential flexibility", and had this been  invoked  in
    an appropriate manner, it is clear that the missing evidence would have
    surfaced and the appeal would have been allowed.

Remaking the Decision

14. I remade the decision on the basis of  the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before her, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing this appeal for the reasons that I have  set  out
    above.





Notice of Decision

15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed.

16. No anonymity direction is made.
