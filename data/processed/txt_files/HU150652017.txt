Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mills, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Ali, instructed by Zakk Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent and the respondent  as
    the appellant (as they  respectively  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal). The appellant was born on 6 February 1971 and is  a  citizen
    of Mauritius. He entered the United Kingdom in December 2005. He  lives
    with his wife who is a British citizen naturalised in 2017. The  couple
    have twin daughters who are aged over 18 years. On  16  May  2017,  the
    appellant pleaded guilty at Nottingham Crown Court to a charge of fraud
    by abuse of position. Whilst a manager of a care home,  he  had  stolen
    ï¿½8000 from a patient's bank account. He  was  sentenced  to  12  months
    imprisonment. On 13 November 2017, a deportation order was made against
    the appellant and on 14 November  2017  the  Secretary  of  State  gave
    reasons for refusing the appellant's human rights claim. The  appellant
    appealed against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal which,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 28 December 2018, allowed the appeal  on  human
    rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR). The Secretary  of  State  now  appeals
    with permission to the Upper Tribunal.

    Giving Weight to Immaterial Matters

 2. The Secretary of State challenges the decision on the  basis  that  the
    judge has improperly had regard  to  matters  which  were  relevant  or
    immaterial. As at  the  date  of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, the twin daughters of the appellant were aged over 18  years.
    Notwithstanding that fact, the judge proceeded to carry out an analysis
    applying paragraph 399(a) of HC 395 (as amended). At  [55],  the  judge
    wrote:

         "Human rights law recognises 'no bright line' principle with regard
         to children who have turned 18 but remain embedded in a  close-knit
         family units with their parents. I have no doubt that the  children
         continue to enjoy family life  with  their  parents  and  that  the
         Kugathas criteria continue to be met. The fact  that  their  pastor
         18th birthday does not mean  that  their  emotional  dependency  on
         their parents has been switched off."

 3. It is clear that the judge was aware  that  paragraph  399(a)  did  not
    apply in terms on account of the age of the children. He was wrong,  in
    my opinion, to hold that there was no 'bright line' in the  application
    of the provisions of the Immigration Rules. It is  the  case  that  the
    principle enunciated in Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ 31 has been  qualified
    by the acknowledgement that children  do  not  cease  to  be  dependent
    members of a family simply by achieving the age of 18  years.  However,
    that acknowledgement is relevant to  the  analysis  of  the  appeal  on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds  outside  the  rules,  not  to  that  under  the
    Immigration Rules or by reference to the 2002  Act.  Ultimately,  there
    was no error in the judge's approach because, although his  application
    of the rule to the children in this instance was nugatory, the  matters
    which he considers in applying the rule, such as the dependence of  the
    adult children on their parents, remained a relevant  consideration  in
    an appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  Whether  the  judge  should  have
    considered Article 8 ECHR outside the rules is discussed below but I am
    not satisfied that this error per se materially affects the outcome  of
    the appeal.

    Very compelling circumstances over and above Ex 2 (Section 117C of  the
    2002 Act)

 4. The judge, having considered the application of the Immigration  Rules,
    proceeded also to consider section 117C of the 2002 Act (as amended):

         Article 8: additional considerations  in  cases  involving  foreign
         criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7)  The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.

 5. It is clear that the judge had regard to the authority of NA (Pakistan)
    [2016] EWCA Civ 662, noting that 'the appellant cannot avail himself of
    this safety net [Exceptions 1 and 2 of section 117C]  and  so  he  must
    fall back on  very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above  those
    described in Exceptions 1 or 2.'

 6. NA provides guidance which is particularly relevant to this  appeal  at
    [27], [33] and [36]:

         "27. For all these reasons we shall proceed on the basis that  fall
         back protection of the kind stated in section 117C(6)  avails  both
         (a) serious offenders and (b) medium  offenders  who  fall  outside
         Exceptions 1 and 2. On a proper construction of section 117C(3), it
         provides that for medium offenders "the  public  interest  requires
         C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies or unless
         there are very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above  those
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2. ...

         33.   Although  there  is  no  'exceptionality'   requirement,   it
         inexorably follows from the statutory  scheme  that  the  cases  in
         which circumstances are sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh  the
         high public interest in deportation will be rare.  The  commonplace
         incidents of family life, such as ageing parents in poor health  or
         the  natural  love  between  parents  and  children,  will  not  be
         sufficient. ...

         36.  In relation to a medium offender, first see whether  he  falls
         within Exception 1 or Exception 2. If he does, then the  Article  8
         claim succeeds. If he does not, then the next stage is to  consider
         whether there are "sufficiently compelling circumstances, over  and
         above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2". If  there  are,  then
         the Article 8 claim succeeds. If there are not, then the Article  8
         claim fails. As was the case under the 2012 rules (as explained  in
         MF (Nigeria)), there is no room for a general Article 8  evaluation
         outside the 2014 rules, read with sections 117A-117D  of  the  2002
         Act."

 7. The rules read with the statutory  provisions  of  section  117  should
    leave little, if any, room for an appeal to succeed on Article  8  ECHR
    grounds. In the instant appeal, the judge found that, 'distressing  and
    destabilising as her  husband's  [and,  by  extension,  the  children's
    father's] absence will be, it is hard  to  see...how  the  consequences
    would be any different from any disruption of a genuine and  subsisting
    marital [and parental] relationship  arising  from  deportation'  [72].
    Having reached that conclusion, the judge proceeded to consider Article
    8 ECHR outside the rules. He does not appear to have appreciated  that,
    as the Court of Appeal stressed in NA, the  margin  for  the  appellant
    succeed was very narrow indeed. Instead, after a very thorough analysis
    of the immigration rules  and  the  statutory  provision,  the  judge's
    decision ends somewhat abruptly. The judge found that the appellant was
    genuinely remorseful, that his offending was out of character and  that
    he presented a very low risk of reoffending. He found that  'it  is  in
    the appellant's favour that he is at the bottom end  of  the  scale  in
    terms of being a medium offender.' The judge found that  the  appellant
    speaks good English and is well integrated into UK  society.  Then,  at
    [82], he concluded his analysis as follows:

         "On the Article 8 (1) side of the equation, there are  the  factors
         contributing a strong Article 8 claim which I previously identified
         in the context  of  my  discussion  at  the  extent  to  which  the
         appellant meets the  exceptions  to  deportation  provided  in  the
         Rules. In summary, the effect of deportation will be to split up  a
         close-knit family of lawfully-settled migrants."

 8.  I  find  that  the  judge  has  done  little  more  than  to   recycle
    considerations which had failed to satisfy the exceptions  set  out  in
    the statute but which, for reasons which are not clear, the judge finds
    do occupy that very narrow margin 'over and above' those exceptions. He
    has, in effect, found that the splitting up of a close-knit  family  of
    lawfully-settled migrants is the natural consequence of deportation but
    is also a very compelling circumstance. As Court of Appeal observed  in
    NA, 'there is no room for a general Article 8  evaluation  outside  the
    2014 rules, read  with  sections  117A-117D  of  the  2002  Act'.  That
    evaluation is, in effect, is what  the  judge  has  carried  out  here,
    giving decisive weight to considerations which he had already  rejected
    as not being unduly harsh.

 9. I have no doubt that the judge had sympathy for this family, as  I  do.
    Unfortunately, that sympathy has led the judge into legal error. I have
    no doubt that the  deportation  of  the  appellant  will  have  a  very
    distressing effect not only upon him but upon his  adult  children  and
    his wife. However, there are no circumstances attaching to this  family
    which are so compelling as to distinguish their distress from  that  of
    any family faced with the deportation of a father/husband. The tribunal
    has no option but to set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    and,  on  the  same  facts,  to  remake  the  decision  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to  deport
    him.

Notice of Decision

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 28 December 2018
    is set aside. I have re-made the  decision.  The  appellant's  decision
    against the decision of the Secretary of  State  to  refuse  his  human
    rights claim is dated 14 November 2017 is dismissed.
