                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                               BAHADAR HUSSAIN
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S McTaggart


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. By a decision made on behalf of the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (the "Secretary of State"),  dated  12  February  2014,  the
    Respondent's combined applications for leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student and  for  a  biometric  residence
    permit were refused.  The refusal  was  based  on  the  fact  that  the
    Respondent was not in possession of a valid "Confirmation of Acceptance
    for Studies" ("CAS").

 2. The ensuing appeal to the First-tier Tribunal (the "FtT")  was  allowed
    on the following basis:

         "The Appellant submits in his grounds of appeal  that  he  had  not
         realised that he had needed to  submit  a  new  CAS.   He  has  now
         submitted a new CAS reference number [.........] ...  and  on  that
         basis I  find  he  has  satisfied  the  requirements  ......  under
         [paragraph 116(ea) of Appendix A to the Immigration  Rules]  and  I
         allow the appeal to that extent."

    The Judge added:

         "I  am  however  unable  to  determine  whether  he  satisfies  the
         maintenance requirements and I remit the appeal to  the  Respondent
         for a decision in relation to maintenance."

 3. I conclude that the decision of the FtT is unsustainable in law  as  it
    was based upon the Judge's consideration of  newly  provided  evidence,
    contrary  to  the  prohibition  enshrined  in  Section  85A(4)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   This  was  conceded  on
    behalf of the Respondent.

DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 4. I decide and direct as follows:

    (a)  The decision of the FtT is set aside.

      b) I remit the case to a differently constituted FtT for  the  purpose
         of remaking the decision.


      c) The further hearing will be listed  on  the  first  available  date
         henceforth.   The  Appellant's  legal  representatives  must   give
         immediate attention to the question of whether the remaking  is  to
         be a paper exercise (as previously) or a conventional inter  partes
         hearing, on payment of the appropriate fee and compliance with  any
         other relevant formality.


                                                                       [pic]
                                                        MR JUSTICE MCCLOSKEY
                                             PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER

                                                       Date: 30 October 2014
