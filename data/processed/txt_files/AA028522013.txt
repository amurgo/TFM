                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Background to the Appeal

1.   The Appellant, [AH], was born on 1 July 1969.   He  is  a  national  of
    both Iran and the Comoros Islands, a  fact  which  gives  rise  to  the
    present permission application.  He and his wife and son arrived in the
    UK from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where  they  had  been  living,
    travelling on their own Comorian passports with valid visit visas, on 5
    July 2012, and the Appellant claimed asylum four days later.

2.   His application was refused, and removal directions were made  to  both
    Iran and the Comoros Islands.  The Appellant's ensuing appeal was heard
    by Judge Scott sitting at Taylor House on 24 April 2013.  The Appellant
    was represented by Miss A J Cole of his solicitors  Elder  Rahimi,  and
    the Respondent by Mr P Crewe, a Home Office Presenting Officer.   Judge
    Scott accepted the evidence of the Appellant and found that he would be
    at real risk in Iran.  He also found that he would not be  at  risk  in
    the Comoros Islands, of which he is a national.  Hence he  was  not  in
    need of international protection.  Judge  Scott  accordingly  dismissed
    his appeal on political asylum, humanitarian protection and Articles  2
    and 3 human rights grounds.

3.   The Appellant sought permission to appeal, essentially on the basis  of
    supervening background evidence that the Comoros Islands do not  accept
    returnees  solely  on  the  basis  of  possessing  Comorian  passports.
    Permission to appeal, later supplemented by procedural directions,  was
    granted by Judge Zucker on 24 June 2013 in the following terms:

         "1.  First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Scott  dismissed  the  Appellant's
             appeal  against  the  Respondent's  decisions  to  refuse   to
             recognise her as a refugee pursuant to paragraph 336 of HC 395
             (as amended) and to remove him from the United Kingdom by  way
             of directions.

         2.   The Appellant was found generally credible.  The  Judge  found
             that the Appellant found that to return the Appellant to  Iran
             would place the United Kingdom in breach of its  international
             obligations.  However the Judge found that  as  the  Appellant
             had a passport for the Comoros Islands,  albeit  obtained  for
             convenience, he could be returned there (see paragraph 38).

         3.   The grounds submit that the background material was such  that
             the Judge's finding cannot stand.  The ground is arguable."

4.   In a Rule 24 response of  11  July  2013  the  Respondent  opposed  the
    appeal on the basis that the judge had made findings  on  the  evidence
    before him that the Appellant  could  avail  himself  of  his  Comorian
    nationality and that whilst he would not  qualify  for  asylum  in  the
    Comoros Islands he would be given protection.

5.   The Appellant attended the error of law hearing, which was  interpreted
    to him by an interpreter in the Arabic language.  The hearing  occupied
    an hour and took the form of submissions.  These  submissions  together
    with the skeleton argument which was before Judge Scott, the permission
    application and the Rule 24 response have all considerably assisted  me
    to come to my decision.



Determination

6.   In his statement which was before Judge Scott, the Appellant  explained
    that he is and has long sympathised with the plight of Ahwazi Arabs  in
    Iran,  where  he  would  be  regarded  as  Wahhabi  (paragraph  19  and
    generally).  Living and working in the UAE, he and his family  obtained
    passports of  the  Comoros  Islands,  which  are  regularly  issued  to
    stateless people from Iran, who are generally Ahwazi Arabs, as a  means
    of allowing them to  live  in  the  UAE  with  some  form  of  official
    documentation (paragraph 12).  He could not live in the Comoros Islands
    as he has only visited there briefly and has no cultural or other ties.
     The Comoros Islands are known for their corrupt practices and are very
    well supported by the Iranian Government, who  could  easily  find  him
    there.  For him and his family the  passports  issued  by  the  Comoros
    Islands were passports of convenience allowing him to live and work  in
    the UAE (paragraph 21).

7.   As well as considerable background  evidence  on  Iran,  there  was  in
    evidence before Judge Scott one report on Comoros,  which  was  the  US
    State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2011.  At
    paragraph 27 of his  determination  Judge  Scott  cited  the  paragraph
    headed "Protection of Refugees" which provides:

         "Protection of Refugees

         The law does not provide for the  granting  of  asylum  or  refugee
         status, and  the  government  has  not  established  a  system  for
         providing protection to refugees.  In practice, although  very  few
         refugees sought asylum, the government provided protection  against
         the expulsion or return of refugees to countries where their  lives
         or freedom would be threatened on account of their race,  religion,
         nationality, membership in  (sic)  a  particular  social  group  or
         political opinion."

8.   Having found the Appellant to be at real  risk  in  Iran,  Judge  Scott
    went on to consider his situation in relation to the  Comoros  Islands.
    He wrote this:

         "(b) Comoros Islands

         38.  However, that  is  not  an  end  of  the  matter  because  the
             appellant also has Comorian nationality.  I accept that he has
             no actual connection with the  Comoros  Islands  and  that  he
             obtained his Comorian nationality as a matter of  convenience.
             Nevertheless, he has that nationality and  he  holds  a  valid
             Comorian passport.  It follows that he could go  there  rather
             than to Iran.

         39.  The question, therefore is whether the appellant would face  a
             real risk of suffering persecution  in  the  Comoros  Islands.
             There is simply no evidence that he would.  Such  evidence  as
             there is suggests that, while there is no system for  granting
             asylum or refugee status, the Comorian government does in fact
             provide protection to persons in the appellant's position.

         40.  Although there is evidence of friendly relations  between  the
             Comoros Islands and Iran, there is nothing to suggest that the
             Comorian  authorities  would   be   aware   of   the   Iranian
             authorities' interest in the appellant,  or  that  they  would
             pass on information about his location or that they  would  be
             prepared to deport him to Iran.  To suggest that,  because  of
             those relations, the appellant would also be at  risk  in  the
             Comoros Islands or would be returned to Iran from there is,  I
             find, simply speculation.

         41.  I conclude that, while the appellant would face a real risk of
             being persecuted for Convention reasons if returned  to  Iran,
             he would not face such  a  risk  if  removed  to  the  Comoros
             Islands.  As he is a  Comorian  national  (however  that  came
             about), and as he not shown that he would face a real risk  of
             suffering  persecution  there,  he   is   not   in   need   of
             international protection and his removal there would not place
             the  United   Kingdom   in   breach   of   its   international
             obligations."

9.   The essence of the Appellant's application for permission to appeal  is
    as follows:

         "5.  It is clear, however that the Comoros Islands  do  not  accept
             returnees, merely on the  basis  that  they  possess  Comorian
             passports.  As is asserted in the US State Department  Country
             Report on Human Rights Practices 2012: United Arab Emirates:

             d.  Freedom  of  Movement,   Internally   Displaced   Persons,
             Protection of Refugees,  and  Stateless  Persons  'There  were
             reports of stateless persons being forced  to  accept  another
             country's citizenship, namely from the Republic of Comoros, as
             a means to gain a passport and legal identification.  If  they
             were deported, the Republic of Comoros would not accept  these
             persons, who would have to find refuge in another country.'

         6.   The JFtT accepts  that  the  Appellant  and  his  family  only
             obtained Comorian passports because they were stateless  while
             in the UAE.  In line with the reasoning in the excerpt  above,
             the Appellant and his family  could  not  be  removed  to  the
             Comoros Islands."

10.  The quotation about the Republic of Comoros  cited  in  the  permission
    application is indeed from the US State Department  Country  Report  on
    Human Rights Practices in the United Arab Emirates for 2012,  which  is
    dated 19 April 2013.  I note that the report addresses the UAE, not the
    Comoros Islands.  It contains a  section  headed  "Stateless  Persons".
    Discussing the stateless Bidoon, whose numbers are an unverified  range
    of 20,000 to 100,000 people, this includes the  section  reproduced  in
    italics above.

11.  The thrust of the permission application is that, as  the  2012  report
    on the UAE arguably demonstrates, the material in the  2011  report  on
    the Comoros Islands upon which Judge  Scott  based  this  part  of  his
    decision was factually wrong.  This was a mistake of fact  giving  rise
    to unfairness and an error of law, as discussed in R (Iran) & others  v
    SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 982 at paragraphs 28 to 33.  On that basis  it  is
    argued  that  the  Tribunal  is  entitled   to   interfere   with   the
    determination.  As to the fact that the new material had been submitted
    without a formal application under Procedure Rule 15, submissions  were
    made on the principles concerning the admission of new evidence in Ladd
    v Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489.

12.  As to the law on asylum and dual nationality,  Macdonald's  Immigration
    Law & Practice, eighth edition, 2010, states that a  person  who  is  a
    national of more than one country  will  be  expected  to  satisfy  the
    refugee definition in respect of each country or to seek protection  of
    that country where  persecution  is  not  feared;  however  the  second
    nationality  must  be  effective,  not   merely   formal,   before   it
    disqualifies someone from  refugee  status  vis-�-vis  the  country  of
    persecution (section 12.37 and the cases cited in notes 2 and 3).

13.  The skeleton argument of Miss Cole which was before  Judge  Scott  does
    not address the Comoros Islands substantively and does not reflect  any
    submission that the Appellant's Comorian nationality was merely  formal
    rather than effective.  The Appellant's statement  may  have  suggested
    this, but the  submission  needed  to  be  made.   In  a  transparently
    conscientious determination plainly addressing all material issues, the
    only possible reference to this is in  paragraph  41,  in  which  Judge
    Scott wrote "As he is a Comorian national (however  that  came  about),
    ...".  Without any evidence of this submission having been made,  still
    less supported with background  evidence  on  the  nature  of  Comorian
    nationality, Judge Scott cannot  have  been  expected  to  reflect  it.
    Indeed for him to have done so would have been speculative and  legally
    erroneous.

14.  Conscious  of  the  paucity  of  background  evidence  on  the  Comoros
    Islands, and citing at paragraph 27 the one material extract  from  it,
    Judge Scott wrote at paragraph 39  that  "Such  evidence  as  there  is
    suggests that, while there is no system for granting asylum or  refugee
    status, the Comorian government does  in  fact  provide  protection  to
    persons in the appellant's position".  This finding  was  open  to  him
    from the evidence.  Indeed, it is hard to see  what  other  finding  he
    could have reached  which  would  not  itself  have  been  against  the
    evidence, speculative and legally erroneous.

15.  The  present  jurisdiction  is  confined  to  material  error  of  law.
    Background  evidence  which  was  not  before  the  judge   and   which
    contradicts that which was does not establish an  error  of  law.   The
    evidence in the 2012 report that the  Republic  of  Comoros  would  not
    accept  stateless  people  who  had  been  forced  to  accept  Comorian
    citizenship were they deported was not  before  Judge  Scott,  who  was
    naturally entitled to assume that the Comoros Islands would admit their
    own citizens.

16.  In summary, it is not an error of law for a  judge  not  to  take  into
    account material and submissions which were not  before  him.   On  the
    contrary, for a judge to do so, if he is able to conceive of them,  may
    well lead him into speculation and legal error.  The  determination  of
    Judge Scott reflects no error of law.

17.   What  the  permission  application  does  reflect  is   new   evidence
    contradicting that which was before the  Respondent  and  the  Tribunal
    which may be relevant to the assessment of risk to the Appellant in the
    Comoros Islands.   Whilst  those  advising  the  Appellant  might  have
    developed the issue of his  Comorian  nationality  having  been  merely
    formal rather than effective, they cannot have envisaged a report, from
    the same source as the one which was in evidence, which, being dated 19
    April 2013, was not in  existence  when  the  appeal  was  prepared  in
    readiness for the hearing on 24 April 2013.  At first impression,  this
    may meet the criteria in the Immigration Rules for a  fresh  claim  for
    asylum.  Bearing in mind that Judge Scott  accepted  the  evidence  and
    credibility of the Appellant and the prima facie indicators that he may
    be at real risk in the Comoros Islands  as  well  as  in  Iran,  it  is
    appropriate for me to express the hope that if the Appellant submits  a
    fresh claim the Respondent will accept it as such.



Decision

18.  The original determination contains no error of law and is upheld.
