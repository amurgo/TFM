For the Appellant:     Mr Noor, Counsel instructed by Prestige Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq who  seeks  leave  to  enter  the
       United Kingdom  under  Regulation  9  of  the  Immigration  (European
       Economic Area) Regulations 2016, i.e. the 'Surinder Singh' route.

       Background and Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

    2. It is the Appellant's case that she and her British  husband  resided
       in  Romania,  and  established  treaty  rights  there  prior  to  her
       husband's return to the United Kingdom.

    3. The ECO had assessed the Appellant's application  with  reference  to
       Regulation 9 of the Regulations.  Insofar  as  this  is  relevant  it
       reads:

       '9.- (1)   If the conditions in paragraph (2)  are  satisfied,  these
           Regulations apply to a person who is the family member ("F")  of
           a British citizen ("BC") as though the BC were an EEA national.

           (2)   The conditions are that-

                (a)    BC-

                    (i)      is residing in an EEA State as a worker,  self-
                    employed person, self-sufficient person or a student, or
                    so resided immediately before returning  to  the  United
                    Kingdom; or

                    (ii)     has acquired the right of  permanent  residence
                    in an EEA State;

                (b)    F and BC resided together in the EEA State; and

                (c)    F and BC's residence in the EEA State was genuine.

           (3)   Factors relevant to whether residence in the EEA State  is
           or was genuine include-

                (a)    whether the centre of BC's life  transferred  to  the
                EEA State;

                (b)    the length of F and BC's joint residence in  the  EEA
                State;

                (c)     the  nature  and  quality  of   the   F   and   BC's
                accommodation in the EEA State, and whether  it  is  or  was
                BC's principal residence;

                (d)    the degree of F  and  BC's  integration  in  the  EEA
                State;

                (e)    whether F's first lawful residence in the EU with  BC
                was in the EEA State.

           (4)   This regulation does not apply-

                (a) where the purpose of the residence in the EEA State  was
                as a means for circumventing any immigration  laws  applying
                to non-EEA nationals to which F would otherwise  be  subject
                (such as any applicable requirement under the  1971  Act  to
                have leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom); or

                ...'

    4. The First-tier Tribunal accepted  that  the  couple  had  spent  four
       months living in Romania together, with the sponsor  having  spent  a
       further eight months in that country. It accepted  that  the  sponsor
       had worked there in a  self-employed  capacity,  running  a  business
       offering guided spear-fishing tours.  He had a total of  ten  clients
       who between them had paid him the equivalent of five  months  of  the
       average  Romanian  salary.  It  accepted  that  there   was   clearly
       sufficient evidence that he had been exercising treaty rights,  since
       the Romanian authorities had granted  him  a  residence  card.    The
       First-tier Tribunal was not however satisfied that this constituted a
       "genuine" period of residence in Romania for the following reasons:

        i) The Sponsor has never earned enough in  the  United  Kingdom  to
           sponsor the Appellant's entry through the  standard  immigration
           rules (a  reference  to  the  'minimum  income  requirement'  of
           ï¿½18,600 in Appendix FM);

       ii) The application for a family permit is  free  whereas  it  would
           have cost the appellant a considerable amount of money to  apply
           for settlement under the Rules;

      iii) There were "implausibilities" in the sponsor's explanation as to
           how he ran those tours, including his own limited Romanian,  the
           fact that his brother was his assistant but knew  nothing  about
           spear  fishing  himself  and  his  brother   had   no   business
           experience;

       iv) The Appellant  and  her  sponsor  appear  to  have  done  little
           research into life in Romania before deciding to move there.  It
           is not clear why they decided  to  move  there  given  that  the
           Sponsor's brother (who had been there many years prior to  their
           arrival and was married to a Romanian) faced a "precarious"  job
           situation;

        v) The Judge did not find it plausible that the couple would decide
           to return to the United  Kingdom  because  the  Appellant  found
           living in Romania "uncomfortable", for instance  when  she  wore
           her headscarf during Ramadhan;

       vi) There was little  evidence  of  integration:  "the  exercise  of
           treaty rights may have technically occurred, but  it  was  never
           something which was done with full  gusto  as  a  new  start  in
           Romania".

    5. The appeal was thereby dismissed, the Tribunal concluding  that  that
       the couple had  artificially  created  the  necessary  conditions  to
       comply with Regulation 9 without ever genuinely trying to  settle  in
       Romania.

       Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

    6. Mr Noor advanced two interrelated grounds of appeal.

    7. The first concerns the approach to the facts taken by  the  Tribunal.
       Mr Noor contrasts the Tribunal's doubts, expressed at  10-11  of  the
       determination, about the Sponsor's employment in  Romania,  with  its
       own findings that he had in  fact  been  running  his  own  business.
       Insofar as those paragraphs could be  read  as  contributing  to  the
       overall negative conclusion they were irrational at worse and  otiose
       at best.   I  entirely  agree.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  had  heard
       unchallenged oral evidence from one of the sponsor's clients; it  had
       seen official registration documents,  bank  deposits  and  invoices.
       Having done so it  expressly  accepted,  at  paragraph  9,  that  the
       business was operating and that between the 5th November 2016 and May
       2017 the Sponsor had earned the approximate equivalent of five months
       of the average salary in Romania.  Whilst he may  have  earned  below
       the average, I am satisfied that this clearly  amounted  to  economic
       activity for the purpose of the Directive, and  so,  apparently,  did
       the Romanians, who had granted him a residence  permit.    There  was
       therefore absolutely no point to the paragraphs which follow, wherein
       the Tribunal attempts to question how the Sponsor's brother  -  whom,
       it is accepted, is a long term  resident  of  Romania  -  might  have
       contributed towards the spear-fishing business.

    8.  The  second,  main  ground,  is   that   the   First-tier   Tribunal
       impermissibly imposed what is in effect  a  'primary  purpose'  rule.
       Insofar as that approach may have been encouraged by Regulation  9(3)
       & (4)  Mr  Noor  invites  me  to  find  the  wording  therein  to  be
       incompatible with the Directive and jurisprudence of direct effect.

    9. The Qualification Directive (2004/38/EC) draws a distinction  between
       the rights of union citizens who are spending three months or less in
       another member state, and those who wish to remain in that state  for
       longer than three months and there exercise treaty rights. Article  6
       (1) provides that the former may enter and remain in the  host  state
       without hindrance or requirements, whereas Article  7  provides  that
       the latter may remain in the host state as long as certain conditions
       are met, namely that they are a qualified person:

                                  Article 6

           Right of residence for up to three months

           1.    Union citizens shall have the right of  residence  on  the
           territory of another Member State for a period of  up  to  three
           months without any conditions or any formalities other than  the
           requirement to hold a valid identity card or passport.

           2.    The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply  to  family
           members in possession of a valid passport who are not  nationals
           of a Member State, accompanying or joining the Union citizen.

                                  Article 7

           Right of residence for more than three months

           1.    All Union citizens shall have the right  of  residence  on
           the territory of another Member State for  a  period  of  longer
           than three months if they:

           (a)   are workers or self-employed persons in  the  host  Member
                    State; or

           (b)   have sufficient resources for themselves and their  family
                    members not to become a burden on the social  assistance
                    system of the host Member State during their  period  of
                    residence  and  have  comprehensive  sickness  insurance
                    cover in the host Member State; or

           (c)   -     are enrolled at a private or  public  establishment,
                        accredited or financed by the host Member State  on
                        the basis  of  its  legislation  or  administrative
                        practice, for the principal purpose of following  a
                        course of study, including vocational training; and

                    -  have comprehensive sickness insurance  cover  in  the
                        host Member State and assure the relevant  national
                        authority, by means of a  declaration  or  by  such
                        equivalent means as they may choose, that they have
                        sufficient  resources  for  themselves  and   their
                        family members not to become a burden on the social
                        assistance system of the host Member  State  during
                        their period of residence; or

           (d)   are family members accompanying or joining a Union citizen
                    who satisfies the conditions referred to in points  (a),
                    (b) or (c).

   10. In O & B v Minister voor Immigratie, Integratie en  Asiel  (C-456/12)
       the Grand Chamber of the ECJ found these distinctions to be  relevant
       to the interpretation of what is meant at Article 3(1) by  the  words
       "move to":

                                  Article 3

           Beneficiaries

           1.    This Directive shall apply to all Union citizens who  move
           to or reside in a Member State other than that of which they are
           a national, and to their family members as defined in point 2 of
           Article 2 who accompany or join them.

   11. The cases before the court concerned two families who had "moved  to"
       other member states but had arguably not "resided" there together. Mr
       O, for instance, was a Nigerian national living in Spain whose  Dutch
       wife was compelled to return to the  Netherlands  in  order  to  find
       work. She had however regularly travelled to Spain to spend time with
       her husband.  The referring court  asked  of  the  ECJ  a  series  of
       questions about this case, the second of  which  was  whether,  in  a
       Surinder Singh scenario, there is a requirement of joint residence in
       a host state of a "certain minimum duration".

   12. In answering that question the court reminds  itself  that  a  third-
       country (i.e. non  EEA)  national  can  only  establish  a  right  of
       residence as a  family  member  where  his  or  her  EEA  spouse  has
       exercised his right of freedom of movement by becoming  "established"
       in another member state [at ï¿½38]. It is in its analysis of what might
       constitute "established" residence that  the  court  focuses  on  the
       difference between the free movement right conferred  by  Article  6,
       and the right of residence  in  another  member  state  conferred  by
       Article 7:

           "50.  So far as concerns the conditions  for  granting,  when  a
           Union citizen returns to the Member  State  of  which  he  is  a
           national, a derived right of residence, based on  Article 21(1)
           TFEU, to a third-country national who is a family member of that
           Union citizen with whom that  citizen  has  resided,  solely  by
           virtue of his being a Union citizen, in the host  Member  State,
           those conditions should not, in principle, be more  strict  than
           those provided for by Directive 2004/38 for the grant of such  a
           right of residence to a third-country national who is  a  family
           member of a Union citizen in  a  case  where  that  citizen  has
           exercised  his  right  of  freedom  of  movement   by   becoming
           established in a Member State other than  the  Member  State  of
           which he is a national. Even though Directive 2004/38  does  not
           cover such a return, it should be  applied  by  analogy  to  the
           conditions for the residence of a  Union  citizen  in  a  Member
           State other than that of which he is a national, given  that  in
           both cases it is the Union citizen who is the  sponsor  for  the
           grant of  a  derived  right  of  residence  to  a  third-country
           national who is a member of his family.

           51.   An obstacle such as that referred to in paragraph 47 above
           will arise only where the residence of the Union citizen in  the
           host Member State has been sufficiently genuine so as to  enable
           that citizen to create or strengthen family life in that  Member
           State. Article 21(1) TFEU does not therefore require that every
           residence  in  the  host  Member  State  by  a   Union   citizen
           accompanied by a family member who is a  third-country  national
           necessarily confers a derived right of residence on that  family
           member in the Member State of which that citizen is  a  national
           upon the citizen's return to that Member State.

           52.   In that regard, it should be observed that a Union citizen
           who exercises his rights under Article 6(1) of Directive 2004/38
           does not intend to settle in the host  Member  State  in  a  way
           which would be such as to create or strengthen  family  life  in
           that Member State. Accordingly, the refusal to confer, when that
           citizen returns to his Member State of origin, a  derived  right
           of residence on members of  his  family  who  are  third-country
           nationals will not deter such  a  citizen  from  exercising  his
           rights under Article 6.

           53.   On the other hand, an obstacle such as that referred to in
           paragraph 47 above may  be  created  where  the  Union  citizen
           intends to exercise his rights under Article 7(1) of  Directive
           2004/38. Residence in the host Member State pursuant to  and  in
           conformity with the conditions set out in Article 7(1) of  that
           directive is, in  principle,  evidence  of  settling  there  and
           therefore of the Union citizen's genuine residence in  the  host
           Member  State  and  goes  hand  in  hand   with   creating   and
           strengthening family life in that Member State.

           54.   Where, during the genuine residence of the  Union  citizen
           in the host Member State, pursuant to and in conformity with the
           conditions set out in Article 7(1) and (2) of Directive 2004/38,
           family life is created or strengthened in that Member State, the
           effectiveness of the rights conferred on the  Union  citizen  by
           Article 21(1) TFEU requires that the citizen's family  life  in
           the host Member State may continue on returning to the Member of
           State of which he is a national, through the grant of a  derived
           right of residence to the family member who is  a  third-country
           national. If no such derived right of  residence  were  granted,
           that Union citizen could be discouraged from leaving the  Member
           State of which he is a national in order to exercise  his  right
           of residence under Article 21(1) TFEU in another  Member  State
           because he is uncertain whether he will be able to  continue  in
           his Member State of origin a  family  life  with  his  immediate
           family members which has been created  or  strengthened  in  the
           host Member State (see, to  that  effect, Eind,  paragraphs 35
           and 36, and Iida, paragraph 70).

           55.   A  fortiori,  the  effectiveness  of  Article 21(1)  TFEU
           requires that the Union citizen may continue,  on  returning  to
           the Member State of which he is  a  national,  the  family  life
           which he led in the host Member State,  if  he  and  the  family
           member concerned who  is  a  third-country  national  have  been
           granted a permanent right of residence in the host Member  State
           pursuant  to  Article 16(1)  and (2)  of  Directive  2004/38
           respectively.

           56.   Accordingly, it is genuine residence in  the  host  Member
           State of the Union citizen and of the family  member  who  is  a
           third-country national, pursuant to and in conformity  with  the
           conditions set out in Article 7(1) and (2) and  Article 16(1)
           and (2) of Directive 2004/38 respectively, which creates, on the
           Union citizen's return to his Member State of origin, a  derived
           right of residence, on the basis of Article 21(1) TFEU, for the
           third-country national with whom that citizen lived as a  family
           in the host Member State."

   13. Mr Noor relies on these passages from  O  &  B  to  submit  that  the
       exercise of treaty rights under Article 7 is in principle evidence of
       genuine residence in the host member state [ï¿½53]. He further  submits
       that the true test of whether such residence is "genuine" is that set
       out at ï¿½51: has there been residence sufficiently genuine "so  as  to
       enable that citizen to create  or  strengthen  family  life  in  that
       Member State".  Nowhere, he submits, is there  any  support  for  the
       ratio adopted by the First-tier Tribunal in this case.

   14. Mr Noor further placed reliance on the decision in  Akrich  v  United
       Kingdom  (C-109-01).  In  Akrich  a  Moroccan  national,   previously
       deported from the United Kingdom,  had  taken  up  residence  in  the
       Republic of Ireland with his British  spouse.  The  couple  had  then
       sought to return to the United Kingdom pursuant to the Surinder Singh
       principles.  The referring court (this Tribunal) had asked the  court
       to consider whether the United Kingdom was obliged to  recognise  his
       right of entry in circumstances where it believed  the  residence  in
       EIRE to have been deliberately undertaken with a view to returning to
       the United Kingdom.  The question made specific reference to  ï¿½24  of
       the decision in Surinder Singh (C-370/90):

           "24.  As regards the risk of fraud referred  to  by  the  United
           Kingdom, it is  sufficient  to  note  that,  as  the  Court  has
           consistently held (see  in  particular  the  judgments  in  Case
           115/78 Knoors v Secretary of State for Economic  Affairs  [1979]
           ECR 399, paragraph 25, and Case C-61/89 Bouchoucha [1990] ECR I-
           3551, paragraph 14), the facilities created by the Treaty cannot
           have the effect of allowing the persons who benefit from them to
           evade the application of national legislation and of prohibiting
           Member States from taking the measures necessary to prevent such
           abuse."

       And asked in what circumstances  matters  of  fraud  or  abuse  might
       prevent a third country  national  from  taking  the  Surinder  Singh
       route.

   15. The court confirmed that whilst a third-country  national  could  not
       for instance rely on a  marriage  of  convenience,  the  motives  for
       taking up residence in the host state were irrelevant, as long as the
       EEA national there intended to  take  up  an  effective  and  genuine
       activity:

           "55.  As regards the question of abuse mentioned at paragraph 24
           of the Singh judgment, cited above, it should be mentioned  that
           the motives which may have prompted a worker of a  Member  State
           to seek employment in another Member State are of no account  as
           regards his right to enter and reside in the  territory  of  the
           latter State provided that he there pursues or wishes to  pursue
           an effective and genuine activity (Case 53/81 Levin  [1982]  ECR
           1035, paragraph 23).

           56.   Nor are such  motives  relevant  in  assessing  the  legal
           situation of the couple at the  time  of  their  return  to  the
           Member State of which the worker is  a  national.  Such  conduct
           cannot constitute an abuse within the meaning of paragraph 24 of
           the Singh judgment even if the spouse did not, at the time  when
           the couple installed itself in  another  Member  State,  have  a
           right to remain in the Member State of which  the  worker  is  a
           national."

   16. Mr Noor submitted that the First-tier Tribunal  was  bound  by  these
       authorities, and in its repeated reference to the  intention  of  the
       parties in choosing  to  establish  themselves  in  Romania,  it  had
       misdirected itself in law.

   17. Mr McVeety accepted that Regulation 9(3) had to be read in line  with
       ECJ jurisprudence. He  submitted  that  each  of  the  matters  there
       identified were a relevant consideration to the question  of  whether
       the residence in the host  state  was  "genuine".    The  three-month
       period that is the  focus  of  the  decision  in  O&B  was  not,  for
       instance, inconsistent with the factor at  Regulation  9(3)(b):  "the
       length of F and BC's joint residence in the EEA State".   He  further
       pointed out that the fact that the Romanians had issued  a  residence
       permit was not, according to O&B, determinative; the court  had  only
       held that it would in  principle  establish  genuine  residence.   Mr
       McVeety  submitted  that  the  First-tier   Tribunal   had   properly
       considered whether the centre  of  the  couple's  life  had  in  fact
       transferred  to  Romania,  and  that  this  was  equivalent  to   the
       expression used by the court in O&B, whether their  family  life  had
       strengthened there.

   18. I am satisfied that the Appellant has made out her grounds.

   19. The finding of the First-tier Tribunal is,  in  accordance  with  the
       decision of the Respondent, that the couple all along intended in the
       long run to come and live in  the  United  Kingdom.     The  Tribunal
       concluded from this that their residence in Romania merely tokenistic
       and not therefore "genuine".  At  paragraph  11,  for  instance,  the
       determination comments, in the context  of  a  discussion  about  the
       Romanian job market, "it does not give a stable bedrock to starting a
       new future there".   There was of course no  requirement,  in  either
       the Directive or Regulations, that the couple intended to  spend  the
       rest of their lives in  Romania.  It  is  perfectly  possible  for  a
       couple, or indeed an individual, to intend to live in place A  for  a
       certain amount of time with a view, in the longer term, to moving  to
       place B.   That does not mean  that  the  residence  in  place  A  is
       illusory, cynical or "not genuine". To give  a  domestic  example,  a
       student from Manchester may take up a place at university in Aberdeen
       without the intention of remaining in that city for  ever;  the  fact
       that he is only there for the duration of his studies does  not  mean
       that he has not "genuinely" lived there.

   20. The Tribunal further  identified  three  facts  indicating  that  the
       Appellant could not qualify for entry under  the  Immigration  Rules:
       the Sponsor could not meet the minimum income  requirement,  she  had
       not passed her English language test and she had not paid the fee for
       a settlement visa.  Those facts are then relied  upon  to  reach  the
       conclusion that the residence in Romania  was  entirely  manufactured
       for the purpose of circumventing  those  Rules.   Setting  aside  the
       somewhat dubious nexus between facts and the conclusion, I agree with
       Mr Noor that the Tribunal  has  here  apparently  ignored  the  clear
       dictum in Akrich to the effect that the intention  is  not  relevant.
       The only  question  is  whether  the  individuals  in  question  have
       genuinely established themselves in the host country.

   21. In this case the Tribunal itself had accepted that  the  Sponsor  had
       lived in Romania for approximately one year,  four  months  of  which
       were with the Appellant. It had accepted that  he  had  run  his  own
       business, and made a living out of it.   It appeared  to  accept  (at
       least no adverse conclusion is reached) that the couple  had  a  home
       together there. It accepted that when they lived in Romania they  did
       so alongside  other  family  members  who  had  an  established  long
       residence, and indeed citizenship there.   All of these factors point
       strongly towards the residence being "genuine". The EEA  Sponsor  was
       exercising treaty rights. Both he and his wife lived together in that
       country. To use the language of O&B, they strengthened  their  family
       life together there.  Applying O&B and Akrich these  factors  are  in
       themselves sufficient to discharge the burden of proof.
