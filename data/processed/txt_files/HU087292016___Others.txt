Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr V Jagadeshan, Counsel instructed by Prolegis
Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Miss R Pettersen, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The First and Second Appellants are nationals of  Vietnam.   The  Third
    Appellant was a national of Vietnam but is now a British national.  The
    Fourth Appellant is a national of Vietnam.  The  Appellants'  children,
    that is the Third and Fourth Appellants' dates of birth  are  28  March
    2008 and 22 January 2010, born in the United  Kingdom  and  have  never
    left.

2.   The applications for leave to remain were  refused  on  10  March  2016
    which were appealed and the appeals  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Buchanan (the Judge) who  on  10  October  2017  dismissed  them.
    Permission to appeal the Judge's decision was given on 4 April 2018 and
    the Respondent made a Rule 24 response on 7 June 2018.

3.   The gravamen of the challenge to the Judge's decision  was  essentially
    that the Judge had failed to properly analyse and deal  with  the  fact
    that the Third Appellant had been in the United Kingdom at  that  stage
    some nine and a half years and has now been here sufficiently  long  to
    acquire and obtain British nationality.  The Fourth Appellant  born  in
    the United Kingdom was at the time the  Judge  considered  this  matter
    over 7 years of age.  There was no suggestion in the  Judge's  findings
    that the First and Second Appellants were not the  responsible  parents
    who had the care and control in the upbringing of the Third and  Fourth
    Appellants.

4.   It is plain that the Judge laboured under a mistake at least  of  fact,
    that the First and Second Appellants  were  subject  to  a  deportation
    process.  Quite what he made of the Third  and  Fourth  Appellants  was
    less than clear, but it is sufficient to say the arguments as presented
    in his thinking and findings conflated  the  issue  of  the  First  and
    Second Appellants'  immigration  history  and  conduct  in  the  United
    Kingdom with the issue of best interests and the issue of whether it is
    reasonable to expect the children to leave the United Kingdom.

5.   In fact  the  Judge  never  addressed  the  Fourth  Appellant's,  as  a
    qualifying child, case in any material way.  It is  sufficient  to  say
    that the Judge's reasoning  showed  that  he  had  failed  to  properly
    address the issue of whether it was  reasonable  for  the  children  to
    leave, even taking into account the parents'  immigration  history  and
    whether or not in the circumstances either on the  basis  that  Section
    117B(6) NIAA 2002 as amended or  under  the  general  consideration  of
    proportionality or if it was unduly harsh for the children to leave.

6.   I  was  satisfied  that  the  Original  Tribunal's  reasoning  did  not
    adequately address the critical issues on an appropriate basis, and the
    Judge made a number of findings which, had he properly looked  at  this
    exercise, might well have led to a considerably different  decision  in
    relation to the Third and Fourth Appellants

7.   Mr Jagadeshan provided a helpful submission in writing  addressing  the
    issue and in particular emphasising as might be expected the extent  to
    which the children have been in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  particular
    context for the Third Appellant's education,  the  material  difference
    between expecting them to return and settle into schooling and face the
    changes that might arise  on  a  return  to  Vietnam  and  the  general
    implications of the Secretary of State's published policy  in  relation
    to the removal of British citizens and qualifying children.

8.    In  the  light  of  his  submissions  and  Miss  Pettersen's   helpful
    recognition that her hands are to a degree  tied  now  that  the  Third
    Appellant is a British national, in  the  circumstances  she  correctly
    realised, in the light of that fact and the fact that he could  not  be
    removed,  that  it  was  extremely  difficult  or  would  be  extremely
    difficult to argue either that it was reasonable for him to  leave  the
    UK or that it was proportionate if one looked at it in the wider sense.
     For these reasons and based on the evidence I for  my  part  am  fully
    satisfied on the facts found that it was not reasonable for  the  Third
    and Fourth Appellants to leave the United Kingdom.  It followed on  the
    basis that the First and Second Appellants are the carers  and  parents
    responsible for the Third and Fourth Appellants that it is not  in  the
    public interest nor proportionate for them to leave the UK.

9.    For  these  reasons  therefore  I  am  satisfied  that  the   Original
    Tribunal's decision can not stand and the following decision should  be
    substituted.

DECISION

The appeal of each of the Appellants is allowed on Article 8  ECHR  grounds.


ANONYMITY

No anonymity order was made previously.  None has been requested and in  the
circumstances it does not seem to me given the nature of this decision  that
an anonymity order is required.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Fees were paid by each of the Appellants in the  sum  of  ï¿½140.00.   In  the
circumstances I am satisfied that a fee award in respect of  each  Appellant
should be made on that basis.
