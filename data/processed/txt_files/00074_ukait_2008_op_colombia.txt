Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr T Bobb of Sutovic and Hartigan Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms L Ong, Home Office Presenting Officer

(1) Where a person relies (wholly or in  part)  on  a  period  of  residence
under the earlier 2000 EEA Regulations in order  to  establish  a  permanent
right of residence under regulation 15 of  the  2006  EEA  Regulations,  the
period of 5 years continuous residence in the UK must end on, or  after,  30
April 2006 when the  2006  EEA  Regulations  came  into  force.  (2)  Whilst
residence in accordance with the 2000 Regulations (but not the  1994  Order)
counts as residence "in  accordance  with"  the  2006  Regulations  for  the
purposes of regulation 15(1)(b), a family member must also show by  evidence
that that residence was "with the EEA national".

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Colombia who was  born  on  29  September
    1966.  He arrived in the United Kingdom  on  12  August  1992  and  was
    granted leave to enter for six months as a visitor.  On 3 June 1992  he
    married a Portuguese national who was resident in  the  United  Kingdom
    exercising her Treaty rights.  Following the  marriage,  the  Appellant
    was granted (what was then) a family permit as the family member of  an
    EEA national exercising Treaty rights  in  the  United  Kingdom,  valid
    until 22 October 1997.  That family  permit  was  subsequently  renewed
    until 28 September 2003.

 2. On 22 August 2003, the Appellant was convicted of indecent assault on a
    female and  gross  indecency  with  a  child  at  the  Horseferry  Road
    Magistrates Court.  On 23  September  2003  he  was  sentenced  at  the
    Middlesex Guildford Crown Court to a total of  two  years  imprisonment
    and  ordered  to  sign  the  Sex  Offenders  Register  for  ten  years.
    Subsequently, the Appellant was released from prison on  (surprisingly)
    according to his evidence on 31 June 2004.

 3. On 4 October 2007,  the  Respondent  made  a  decision  to  deport  the
    Appellant on the basis that his deportation was conducive to the public
    good under section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971.  The  Appellant
    appealed and in his "Statement of Additional Evidence"  relied  on  the
    fact that he was married to an EEA national and claimed that he  had  a
    permanent right of residence in  the  UK.   On  11  January  2008,  the
    Respondent issued a supplementary reasons for refusal letter  rejecting
    the Appellant's reliance upon any rights  derived  from  EU  law.   The
    Appellant's  appeal  was  dismissed  by  a  panel   of   the   Tribunal
    (Immigration Judge Chana and Dr  J  O  de  Baros)  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 4 February 2008.  The panel concluded that the Appellant
    had failed to establish that he had  a  permanent  right  of  residence
    under  regulation  15  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) and thus could not rely upon  the  more
    limited  basis  for  removing  him  which  would  otherwise  have  been
    applicable under regulation 19(3) read with regulation 21.   The  panel
    went on to dismiss the appeal concluding that  his  removal  would  not
    breach Article 8 and the discretion to deport the  Appellant  had  been
    correctly exercised under Paragraph 364 of the  Immigration  Rules  (HC
    395).

 4.  On  22  February  2008,  Senior  Immigration  Judge  Waumsley  ordered
    reconsideration.  The sole basis upon which reconsideration was  sought
    and was ordered was that the Panel had erred in law in concluding  that
    the Appellant had not established a permanent right  of  residence  and
    thus had failed to consider the merits of the  Appellant's  deportation
    appeal on  the  basis  of  the  more  limited  ground  for  removal  in
    Regulations 19(3) and 21 of the 2006 Regulations.

 5. We begin with the relevant provisions  of  the  EEA  Regulations  2006.
    Regulation 15(1) provides for certain individuals  to  have  "permanent
    right of residence" and, so far as relevant, provides as follows:

      "15(1)     The following persons shall acquire the right to reside  in
       the             United Kingdom permanently - ....

            (b)  A family member of an EEA national who is  not  himself  an
        EEA                 national but who  has  resided  in  the  United
        Kingdom with the                EEA  national  in  accordance  with
        these Regulations for  a                     continuous  period  of
        five years; ..."

 6. Regulation 15(2) makes  it  clear  that  once  acquired,  a  right  of
    permanent residence will "be only lost through the  absence  from  the
    United  Kingdom  for  a  period  exceeding  two  consecutive   years".
    Regulation 15(3) states that "this regulation is subject to Regulation
    19(3)(b)".  That is a reference to the basis upon which a person  with
    a permanent right of residence  may  be  removed  on  'public  policy,
    public security or public health' grounds.

 7. Regulation 21 provides for the circumstances in which a  decision  may
    be taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
    health.  In particular, in this appeal, Regulation 21(3) is  relevant.
    It provides that:

       "A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a person with  a
       permanent right of residence under Regulation 15 except  on  serious
       grounds of public policy or public security. "

 8. The final provision that we must set out is paragraph 6(1) of Schedule
    4 to the 2006 Regulations which is in the following terms:

       "Periods of Residence Under the 2000 Regulations

       6(1)   Any period during which a person carried out an  activity  or
       was resident    in the United Kingdom in accordance  with  the  2000
       Regulations shall be       treated as  a  period  during  which  the
       person carried out that activity or   was  resident  in  the  United
       Kingdom in accordance with these      Regulations for the purpose of
       calculating  periods  of  activity  and    residence   under   these
       Regulations."

 9. Mr Bobb, who represented the Appellant before us, submitted that on  30
    April 2006 when the EEA Regulations 2006 came into force, the Appellant
    acquired a permanent right of residence under  regulation  15(1)(b)  of
    those Regulations on the basis that the Appellant had resided with  his
    wife (the EEA national) in the United Kingdom in  accordance  with  the
    2006 Regulations for a  continuous  period  of  five  years.   Mr  Bobb
    accepted that the Appellant and his wife had not lived  together  since
    the Appellant went to prison on 22 August 2003.  Mr Bobb accepted  that
    the Appellant's marriage had broken down thereafter.  Indeed,  we  were
    told that the Appellant and his  wife  are  in  the  process  of  being
    divorced.  However, Mr Bobb submitted that  taking  a  period  of  five
    years back from that date the Appellant had lived with  his  wife,  she
    was a qualified person being a worker and as a result the Appellant had
    the requisite continuous period of five years  required  by  regulation
    15(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations.

10. Mr Bobb submitted that periods of  residence  in  accordance  with  the
    predecessor  EEA  provisions  to  the  2006  Regulations,  namely   the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Order 1994  (SI  1994/1895)  which
    came into force on 20 July 1994 and the Immigration (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/362) which replaced it with effect from
    2 October 2000, also counted for this purpose.   Mr  Bobb  pointed  out
    that the Appellant had valid family permits from 26 October 1992  which
    expired in 2003.

11. Mr Bobb relied  upon  the  Tribunal's  decisions  in  MG  and  VC  (EEA
    Regulations 2006; "conductive" deportation) Ireland [2006] UKAIT 00053,
    especially paras [16]-[21] and NB and JN (Right of Permanent Residence)
    France [2007] UKAIT 00039.

12. Ms Ong, who represented the Respondent, submitted  that  regulation  15
    did not apply to the Appellant.  First, she submitted that he could not
    acquire a permanent right of residence on the date regulation  15  came
    into force based upon residence in accordance with the EEA  Regulations
    which had ceased  prior  to  that  date.   She  pointed  out  that  the
    Appellant had not resided with his wife since 2003 and,  therefore,  he
    could not suddenly acquire a permanent right of  residence  based  upon
    five years continuous residence with her  when  that  had  ceased  some
    three years before regulation 15 came into  force.   Secondly,  in  any
    event, Ms Ong submitted that only periods of relevant  residence  under
    the 2006 Regulations or, by virtue of Schedule 4, paragraph 6(1) to the
    2006 Regulations, periods of residence under the 2000  EEA  Regulations
    could count towards the five years required under regulation  15(1)(b).
    She submitted that the deeming provision in Schedule 4, paragraph  6(1)
    which allowed periods of residence under the 2000 Regulations to  count
    as if they  were  periods  of  residence  under  the  2006  Regulations
    excluded from consideration any periods of residence under the  earlier
    1994 EEA Order.   There was no error of law in the panel's decision.

13. The right of EEA nationals and their family members to be admitted  to
    and reside in the United Kingdom when an EEA  national  is  exercising
    Treaty rights has existed since the UK's accession to  the  Treaty  of
    Rome on 1 January 1973.  Those rights were reflected in both the  1994
    and 2000 EEA Regulations and are currently given effect to in the 2006
    Regulations.  However, the 2006  Regulations,  transposing  the  right
    found in the Art 16  of  Citizens  Directive  (Directive  2004/38/EC),
    creates for the first time a "permanent right of  residence"  for  EEA
    nationals and their family members in  certain  circumstances.   Thus,
    there can be no question that an EEA national  or  a  relevant  family
    member could acquire a permanent right of residence prior to 30  April
    2006 when the 2006 Regulations came into force.

14. We did not understand Mr Bobb  to  assert  the  seemingly  impossible,
    namely that the Appellant acquired a right of permanent  residence  no
    later than 22 August 2003.  Rather, we understood Mr  Bobb  to  submit
    that the Appellant's right arose on 30 April 2006 as a consequence  of
    the (then) historic period of residence with his  wife  in  accordance
    with the relevant Regulations for a continuous period  of  five  years
    running back from 22 August 2003.  We reject that submission.  We  see
    no basis upon which the Appellant could acquire a right  on  30  April
    2006 in such circumstances.  It seems to us clear that  regulation  15
    is intended  to  recognise  the  "permanent  right  of  residence"  of
    individuals  who  'clock  up'  the  relevant  five  years   continuous
    residence on or after the  date  it  came  into  effect.   It  is  not
    intended, in our view, to  reflect  the  acquisition  of  a  right  of
    permanent residence based upon a merely historic  period  of  relevant
    residence in the United Kingdom.  We are not aware of any provision in
    the Citizen's Directive itself which supports  Mr  Bobb's  contention.
    Indeed, the wording of Recital (17) suggests otherwise:

           "A permanent right of residence should therefore  be  laid  down
           for all Union citizens and their family members who have resided
           in the host Member State in compliance with the conditions  laid
           down in this Directive during a continuous period of five  years
           without  becoming  subject  to  an  exclusion   measure."   (our
           emphasis)

15. Of course, the 2006 Regulations go further, as we shall see,  in  that
    Schedule 4, paragraph 6(1) allows a period of residence in  accordance
    with the 2000 Regulations also to count towards the 5 years continuous
    residence.  But that, in our view, provides no support  for  a  purely
    historic period of residence in accordance with those Regulations that
    has ceased before 30 April 2006.

16. If Mr Bobb were correct in his  submissions,  it  would  in  our  view
    create the potential for reliance upon EEA free movement rights  where
    there could be  no  justification  for  recognising  them.   Take  for
    example a person who resided in the UK  with  his  EEA  spouse  for  a
    period of five years prior to 30 April 2006: however, before that date
    the marriage broke down the individual left the  UK  and  the  parties
    divorced.  Sometime after April 2006, that individual claims  a  right
    to be admitted and reside in the UK on the basis that  he  acquired  a
    permanent right of residence on 30  April  2006  in  reliance  on  his
    earlier residence with his (now) former spouse in the UK.  Nothing  in
    these circumstances tugs in the direction of recognising  an  EU  free
    movement right to the spouse including  one  that  gives  a  permanent
    right of residence in the UK.  The parties are no longer  married  and
    it is impossible to see how the EU national's right of  free  movement
    would be affected by not  recognising  the  former  'family  member's'
    right of admission and residence.  Indeed, there would be no necessity
    for the EU national to even be in the UK for the  'family  member'  to
    assert his own permanent right of residence.

17. In this case it is not suggested that the Appellant  has  had  any  EU
    basis for remaining in the UK since 2003.  We can  see  no  foundation
    for saying that some three years later the effect of regulation 15 was
    that on the morning of 30 April 2006 he awoke with a  permanent  right
    to reside in the UK.  Ex nihilo nihil fit.  No community  law  notion,
    that a Union Citizen's right  of  free  movement  will  be  "seriously
    obstructed" (see Metock, Case C-127/08 at [62]) if the (former) family
    member's permanent right of residence is not recognised, can  possibly
    be engaged in this  case.   Equally,  where  the  EU  basis  for  that
    individual's right to reside in the UK has disappeared before 30 April
    2006, there is no rational basis for asserting that the earlier period
    of residence warrants the recognition of a permanent right on 30 April
    2006 in order to promote Union Citizenship and  "social cohesion" (see
    Recital (17) of the Directive).

18. Mr Bobb relied upon the Tribunal's decision in NB  and  JN  (Right  of
    Permanent Residence) France [2007]  UKAIT  00039  which  he  submitted
    established that a right of permanent residence could be derived  from
    a five year period accruing prior to the 2006 Regulations coming  into
    force.  With respect, we do not think the case should be so read.   In
    that case, the Tribunal considered whether an EU citizen had  acquired
    a permanent right of residence on the basis of five  years  continuous
    residence in the UK as a  qualified  person.   It  transpired  at  the
    reconsideration hearing that  the  Appellant  had  a  valid  residence
    permit between 11 November 2000 and 8 November 2005.  In reliance upon
    that, it was argued on behalf of  the  Appellant  that  regulation  15
    applied.  For unrelated reasons, the Tribunal held that  the  original
    decision dismissing the Appellant's appeal  could  not  stand  on  the
    basis that there was a material error of law.  Apparently  relying  on
    the period of the residence permit (which curiously seems to have  not
    been quite 5 years in duration), the Tribunal substituted  a  decision
    allowing the appeal, inter alia, on the basis that the first Appellant
    had a right of permanent residence under regulation 15.

19. On the face of it, NB and JN  provides  some  support  for  Mr  Bobb's
    contention about  the  retrospective  application  of  regulation  15.
    However, it is clear that the Tribunal did not  have  the  benefit  of
    full argument on this issue.  The  Tribunal  specifically  records  at
    paragraph [55] that the Appellant's representative did not develop his
    argument in respect of regulation 15 in any detail.  It does not  seem
    to have been suggested before the Tribunal that  regulation  15  could
    not have the effect contended  for  in  this  appeal.   In  fact,  the
    Tribunal's decision merely, in our  view,  assumes  uncritically  that
    regulation 15 can apply in this way.  The  Tribunal's  own  words  are
    somewhat tentative in paragraph [59] that

           "we are also prepared to accept that the  Appellant  appears  to
           meet the requirements of regulation 15...."

20. We have had full argument on the issue and, for the  reasons  we  have
    given, we do not consider that regulation 15 has the effect  contended
    for by Mr Bobb and nothing in the reasoning in NB and JN forces us  to
    reconsider that conclusion.

21. In any event, there is in our view  an  even  clearer  reason  why  Mr
    Bobb's submissions cannot succeed on the facts of this appeal.  It  is
    accepted that the Appellant must rely upon a period  of  residence  in
    the UK with his wife not only under  the  2000  Regulations  but  also
    under the 1994 Order.   It seems to us that Ms Ong is correct  in  her
    submission relying upon paragraph 6(1)  of  Schedule  4  to  the  2006
    Regulations.  Regulation 15(1)(b) requires a continuous period of five
    years' residence  by  a  family  member  with  the  EEA  national  "in
    accordance with these Regulations".  Without  more,  this  phraseology
    would restrict any residence period to that  in  accordance  with  the
    2006 Regulations  themselves.   The  effect  of    paragraph  6(1)  of
    Schedule 4 is to deem a period of residence  in  accordance  with  the
    2000 Regulations to be residence under the 2006 Regulations.

22. There is an important point that arises on the difference  in  wording
    in  the  2006  Regulations  between  regulation  15  and  Schedule  2,
    paragraph 6(1).  The former, mirroring the wording in Art 16.2 of  the
    Directive, requires the family member to be both resident  in  the  UK
    "in accordance" with the 2006 Regulations and that that  residence  be
    "with the EEA  national".   Schedule  2,  paragraph  6(1)  only  deems
    residence in accordance with the 2000 Regulations to be residence  "in
    accordance with the 2006 Regulations".  It does  not  deem  it  to  be
    residence "with the EEA national".   That,  it  would  seem,  must  be
    established on the evidence in addition to lawful residence under  the
    2000 Regulations.  An EEA national's family member could  be  lawfully
    resident under  the  2000  Regulations,  and  indeed  under  the  2006
    Regulations, whilst in the UK even if he is not living  with  the  EEA
    national,  for  example,  his  spouse  (see  regulation  14(2),   2000
    Regulations).  Under the 2000 Regulations, the relationship alone,  or
    in other cases the relationship plus dependency upon the EEA national,
    sufficed to make the individual a "family member" and confer  a  right
    of admission  and  residence.   (The  same  is  true  under  the  2006
    Regulations: see regulations 11  (admission),  13  (initial  right  of
    residence) and 14  (extended  right  of  residence).)   None  of  this
    affects the outcome of this appeal.  Any residence that the  Appellant
    can establish under the 2000 Regulations was, in fact, whilst  he  was
    living with his  spouse.   However,  for  the  reasons  we  shall  see
    shortly, that residence fell short of the required 5 years' duration.

23. Subject to that point,  a  family  member  may  accumulate  continuous
    periods of residence falling either side of 30 April 2006 together  so
    as to acquire  the  necessary  five  years'  residence  with  the  EEA
    national and that residence will be "in  accordance  with  the  [2006]
    Regulations".  As Ms Ong pointed out to us, the 2006 Regulations  make
    no reference to  residence  under  the  earlier  1994  Order  counting
    towards residence in  accordance  with  the  2006  Regulations.   That
    omission is, in our view, telling of the intention of the draftsman of
    the 2006 Regulations.  Of  course,  the  absence  of  such  a  deeming
    provision in respect of the 1994 Order is  entirely  explicable  given
    the view we have taken that regulation 15 can only bite when a  family
    member has established the relevant five years residence on  or  after
    30 April 2006.  Any period of residence under the  1994  Order  would,
    necessarily, fall outside a five year period dating back from 30 April
    2006.  Thus,  no  provision  for  taking  into  account  residence  in
    accordance with the 1994 Order  was  necessary.   Such  periods  would
    simply be irrelevant to the calculation of the five  year  period  in,
    for example, regulation 15.

24. Mr Bobb referred us to the High Court decision  in  Kungwengwe  [2005]
    EWHC 1427 (Admin) in which Mr Bobb said the  Judge  treated  documents
    issued pursuant to the 1994 Order as if they had been issued under the
    2000 Regulations.  Unfortunately, Mr Bobb failed to provided us  with,
    or refer us specifically to any part of, the judgment  in  that  case.
    We have nevertheless obtained a copy of the decision after the hearing
    and it suffices for us to  say  we  did  not  find  the  case  of  any
    assistance in resolving the point for which it was relied upon  by  Mr
    Bobb.  The point in that case was whether  an  individual  could  rely
    upon a period of residence as the family member of any EEA national in
    establishing the requisite period of continuous lawful residence under
    the long residency provisions of the Immigration Rules.  Those  Rules,
    on the face of it, appeared not to include such periods  of  residence
    as they are not periods where the individual has  leave  to  enter  or
    remain (see paragraph 276A(b)).  Wilkie J  agreed  in  dismissing  the
    appellant's application for judicial review but he noted that  it  was
    the Secretary of State's policy to take such periods into account.

25. From the judgment, it appears that the applicant had been issued  with
    a five year residence document on  7  October  1999.   Throughout  his
    judgment, Wilkie J dealt with the case on the basis that the  relevant
    applicable  provisions  were  the  2000  Regulations  and   that   the
    Appellant's residence was in accordance with  those  Regulations.   Of
    course, the 2000 Regulations did not come into force until  2  October
    2000 and thus the Applicant's residence document must have been issued
    under the earlier 1994 Order and the  Applicant's  residence  for  the
    first year of the period of that residence document was prior  to  the
    2000 Regulations coming into force on 2 October  2000.   However,  the
    basis of the Applicant's residence - whether under the 1994  Order  or
    2000 Regulations - was irrelevant in that case.  All that  was  relied
    upon by the applicant was that their residence in the UK was lawful in
    pursuance of their EEA right as a family member.  In our judgement, in
    reality the case takes Mr Bobb's point no further.  Wilkie J  was  not
    concerned  with  a  specific  provision,  as  are  we,  in  the   2006
    Regulations which expressly ties the family member's residence in  the
    UK to residence in accordance with the 2006 EEA Regulations (and by  a
    deeming provision the 2000 Regulations).

26. Mr Bobb also placed some reliance  upon  passages  in  the  Tribunal's
    decision in MG and VC, especially paras[16]-[21].  That case  was,  in
    fact, concerned with the effect  of  the  transitional  provisions  in
    Schedule 4 to appeals heard after 30  April  2006  which  were  either
    pending on that date or related  to  decisions  made  under  the  2000
    Regulations.  That these earlier documents and subsequent appeals must
    be dealt with as if the 2006 Regulations were  always  in  force  does
    not, in any way, cast light on the distinct  issues  in  this  appeal.
    The transitional provisions necessarily needed to  deal  with  pending
    appeals and post-30 April 2006 appeals against earlier decisions  made
    under the 2000 Regulations because the 2006 Regulations  repealed  the
    2000 Regulations and re-categorised the EEA documentation  that  would
    have been the subject of any original decisions.  The case provides no
    support either for recognising a permanent right  of  residence  based
    upon a period of residence in accordance  with  the  2000  Regulations
    which has ceased  by  30  April  2006,  or  for  treating  periods  of
    residence  under  the  1994  Order  as  if  that  were  residence  "in
    accordance with the [2006] Regulations".

27. Consequently, in seeking to bring himself within  regulation  15(1)(b)
    and establish a continuous period of five years residence  in  the  UK
    with his spouse "in accordance with these Regulations", the  Appellant
    may only rely upon residence in accordance  with  the  2000  and  2006
    Regulations.  That residence is limited to a period between 2  October
    2000 and 22 August 2003.  On any calculation, that is less  than  five
    years.

28. For these reasons, we are satisfied that the panel's decision does not
    disclose any material error of  law.   The  decision  to  dismiss  the
    appeal stands.
