                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:      Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Schwenk, Counsel instructed by Amjad Malik
                       Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan born on the 30th January 1979.
     On the 29th October 2015 the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  AK  Simpson)
    allowed his appeal against a decision to refuse to grant leave  and  to
    remove him from the United Kingdom pursuant to s47 of  the  Immigration
    Asylum and Nationality Act  2006.   The  Secretary  of  State  now  has
    permission to appeal against that decision[1].

 2. The dispute between the parties at first instance was whether Mr  Zahid
    qualified for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  'partner'  under  the
    provisions of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, and if he did  not,
    whether he should nevertheless be granted leave to remain on Article  8
    grounds outwith that policy framework.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal accepted, as did the Secretary of  State,  that
    Mr Zahid was in a  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage  with  a  British
    national. It was also common ground that she  had  been,  in  the  year
    preceding the application being  made  in  February  2015,  earning  an
    income from employment and self-employment. The application had however
    been refused on the grounds that Mr Zahid had  failed  to  demonstrate,
    with reference to the 'specified evidence' set out in Appendix FM-SE of
    the Rules, that the household income amounted to at least �18,600.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal found as fact that Mr Zahid's wife was, at  the
    date of hearing, earning �29,798.95 from her combined  income  streams.
    It noted however that in respect of the relevant period, that is to say
    the year preceding the application, not all of the 'specified evidence'
    had been available. Some documents appeared to have gone missing at the
    Home Office, and the required items had not been produced by  Mr  Zahid
    on appeal.  At the very least a bank statement dated October  2013  was
    missing.  The appeal was  therefore  dismissed  under  the  Rules.  The
    Tribunal went on to find Article 8 engaged.  It weighed  the  following
    features of the case in the balance:

               . The sponsor was earning  well  in  excess  of  the  minimum
                 income requirement

               . She was pregnant, expecting the  couple's  first  child  in
                 December 2015

               . This was a technical breach of Appendix FM-SE, relating  to
                 a single missing bank statement

               . Mr Zahid's removal would have serious consequences for  the
                 family life

               . There was only one bank statement missing

    And having done so  found  the  decision  to  be  disproportionate  and
    unlawful.  The appeal was allowed with reference to Article 8 ECHR.




    The Secretary of State's Appeal

 5. The Secretary of State now  appeals  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the following grounds, which fall into two broad  areas  of
    complaint:

    In respect of Article 8:

              i) There has been a failure to apply the guidance in Secretary
                 of State for the Home Department v SS (Congo) & Ors  [2015]
                 EWCA Civ 387

             ii) The Tribunal appears  to  have  impermissibly  allowed  the
                 appeal on the grounds that there had been a 'near miss'  of
                 the Rules

            iii) There is a failure to give reasons  for  the  finding  that
                 there would be "serious consequences" for the family if  Mr
                 Zahid was removed

             iv) There has been a failure to consider  the  public  interest
                 factors set out in s117B of the Nationality Immigration and
                 Asylum Act 2002

      And in respect of the hearing itself:

              v) The First-tier Tribunal failed to take a fair and  balanced
                 approach to the evidence, and made  a  series  of  comments
                 which indicated that "it was clear from the outset that the
                 IJ intended to find a way to allow this appeal".

 6. The appeal is opposed on all grounds  by  Mr  Zahid's  representatives.
    Before me Mr Schwenk  defended  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  any
    accusation of bias, and submitted that on the evidence it was  open  to
    the Tribunal to allow the appeal on the grounds that it did.  Following
    some discussion at hearing about the 'missing documents' I consented to
    reserve my decision; if I was to set the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal aside, I would not re-make the decision until I  had  all  the
    relevant material before me. The further submissions made by Mr Zahid's
    solicitors were to the following effect: any error in the determination
    was not material since the appeal in fact fell to be allowed under  the
    Rules. Although the 'missing documents' were not all supplied with  the
    application, they were available now. In any event at today's date  the
    couple are now parents to a British child and applying the Respondent's
    own guidance it would not be reasonable to  expect  him  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.

 7. For the reasons set out below I have not found it necessary to  address
    all the grounds of appeal, since Mr McVeety persuaded  me  of  a  fatal
    error in the determination in respect of point (iv) above.



    'Error of Law'

 8. I am satisfied that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set
    aside for a failure  to  consider,  directly  or  at  all,  the  public
    interest factors set out in s117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.   Judges are duty bound, by the terms of the  statute,
    to have regard to these considerations. As the Upper Tribunal  held  in
    Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC), the terms of the provision
    are such that it is clear that they are not an  "al  a  carte  menu  of
    considerations at the discretion of  the  judge  to  apply  or  not  to
    apply". Although the matters set out in s117B are not exhaustive,  they
    must be  addressed  in  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise.   Mr
    Schwenk was correct to say that in this case  the  Tribunal  had  found
    that the appellant was financially independent and that he could  speak
    English to the required standard. Those factors do not however dispense
    with the need to consider the public  interest  in  refusing  leave  to
    persons who do not meet the requirements of the rules, nor  indeed  the
    fact that Mr Zahid embarked on his relationship with his wife when  his
    status was precarious:  Rajendran (s117B -  family  life)  [2016]  UKUT
    00138 (IAC). It cannot be said with certainty that the  decision  would
    have been the same at the date of the hearing had  these  factors  been
    properly weighed in the balance.

 9. It follows that I need not address the remaining  grounds  relating  to
    Article 8.  The decision is set aside to be remade.

10. In respect of the second area of contention the  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds enclose what is described as the 'hearing minute' taken by Home
    Office Presenting Officer Mr B. McBride. It is a typed record  prepared
    on the 12th October 2015, four days  after  the  hearing,  and  clearly
    intended for internal  communication  within  the  Borders  Agency.  In
    summary Mr McBride records his view that "It was quite clear  from  the
    outset that the IJ intended to find a way to allow this appeal...".  He
    gives several reasons why he  formed  this  impression,  including  the
    assertion that the Judge announced at the end of proceedings  that  she
    would make a "hash up of SS (Congo) and Article 8", assuring  Mr  Zahid
    and his representative that she would "find a way".

11. Although the factual assertions made by Mr McBride are contested by  Mr
    Schwenk I do not have any evidence from Counsel for Mr Zahid about what
    might have been said at  the  hearing  (Counsel  being  other  than  Mr
    Schwenk). I do not have the benefit of any response from Judge Simpson.
    The record of proceedings is silent.  I have not been provided  with  a
    signed statement from Mr McBride, nor even  his  contemporaneous  notes
    from the hearing. In those circumstances, and given that the  Secretary
    of State succeeds in establishing an error of law in her first  ground,
    I do not consider it necessary to address  this  issue.  I  would,  for
    future reference, say this.   This is not a matter in which  the  facts
    are agreed: cf. Alubankudi (Appearance of Bias) [2015] UKUT 542  (IAC).
    Where a party relies, as a ground of appeal, on disputed assertions  of
    fact about what might have happened at a  hearing,  that  party  should
    make an effort to produce best evidence. A  signed  witness  statement,
    supported by the actual hearing  notes,  and  production  of  the  live
    witness is the ideal.  Although all of  that  could  easily  have  been
    produced here, it was not. I have no doubt that this appeal would  have
    been vigorously opposed by the Secretary of State had the  ground  been
    put, on this footing, by the other side.







    The Re-Made Decision

12. This 'old-style' appeal[2] was dismissed 'under the Rules'.  There  was
    no cross appeal  and  the  only  matter  before  me  on  'remaking'  is
    therefore whether Mr Zahid could succeed on Article 8 grounds  ie  with
    reference to s84 (1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002. That said, the parties before me agreed that  my  starting  point
    should be the Rules, because the extent to which Mr Zahid complied with
    those Rules, or fell short of them, would  inform  my  decision  making
    process in respect of Article 8.

13. The application was made on the 2nd  February  2015  and  the  decision
    letter setting out the Secretary of State's 'reasons  for  refusal'  is
    dated 25th March 2015.  The Secretary of State accepts  that  Mr  Zahid
    and his wife are validly married, and that she is a person present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom. He therefore  meets  the  'relationship'
    requirements that he is a 'partner' as defined in GEN.1.2.  No issue is
    taken with his 'suitability' for leave to remain.  He  has  passed  the
    requisite English language test.  The Secretary of State accepted  that
    Mr Zahid met the requirements of the Rules in respect of accommodation.

14. The application was refused because the  Secretary  of  State  did  not
    accept that Mr Zahid had produced the specified evidence to demonstrate
    that he could meet the financial requirements set out in  paragraph  E-
    LTRP.3.1.   Mr  Zahid's  wife  had  not  been  in  continuous  salaried
    employment for six months prior to the 2nd February 2015. Although  she
    had first been employed  by  Allied  Healthcare  (previously  known  as
    Nestor Primecare) in September 2013, she had taken a break from work in
    September 2014 in order to get married, and had not resumed  employment
    until December of that  year.  At  the  date  of  application  she  had
    therefore had to produce, in  accordance  with  paragraph  2(a)(ii)  of
    Appendix FM-SE, 12  months'  worth  of  payslips,  a  letter  from  her
    employer (paragraph 2(b) FM-SE) and personal bank statements reflecting
    the income set out in the payslips (paragraph  2(c)  FM-SE).    It  was
    accepted from the outset that she had done all of this,  but  that  the
    income shown was not sufficient.  Mr Zahid had  therefore  to  rely  in
    addition on his wife's self-employed earnings. It  was  said  that  she
    owned her own company, called 'LONDON 47  LTD'.   She  had  received  a
    salary from this company as well as dividend payments.  The income from
    this could only be taken into account if the requirements in  paragraph
    7 of Appendix FM-SE were met.  It would appear that  the  Secretary  of
    State was satisfied as to all of those requirements bar one: there  was
    not a complete set of bank statements covering the relevant period  and
    showing the income from this self-employment being deposited.  This was
    particularly pertinent to the dividend  payments  of  �3,333.33,  which
    were said to have been paid in cash.

15. I have been provided with a set of written submissions from Mr  Zahid's
    representatives in which it is acknowledged (at paragraph 3)  that  not
    all of the specified evidence was provided to the Secretary  of  State.
    Although I  have  now  been  provided  with  a  complete  set  of  bank
    statements, payslips, tax documents, accounts and HMRC documents, it is
    accepted that "these documents were unfortunately not available to  the
    appellant beforehand".   I find as fact  that  the  documents  provided
    show a combined income between  February  2014  and  February  2015  of
    �21,813. This is a combined total  of  earnings  from  LONDON  47  LTD,
    dividend payments and salaried employment from Allied/Nestor.   I  find
    that had all of  these  documents  been  provided  in  accordance  with
    paragraphs 2 and 7 of Appendix FM-SE,  Mr  Zahid  would  have  met  the
    requirements of E-LTRP.3.1 and so qualified for leave to remain on  the
    '5 year route to settlement'.  It being accepted that they were not, he
    cannot.

16. There was an alternative route under the Rules. That was the  'ten-year
    route to settlement'. By virtue of  paragraph  R-LTRP.1.1(d)  Mr  Zahid
    could qualify for limited leave to remain as a partner if he could show
    that one of the exceptions in EX.1 applied:

         EX.1. This paragraph applies if

         (a) (i)  the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with a child who-

              (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of  18
              years when the applicant was first granted leave on the  basis
              that this paragraph applied;

              (bb) is in the UK;

              (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK  continuously
              for at least the 7 years immediately  preceding  the  date  of
              application; and

         (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
         UK; or

         (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2.  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
         life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
         would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
         partner.

17. The First-tier Tribunal made no findings as to whether  EX.1  might  be
    engaged. Whilst it was found that there would be "serious consequences"
    for the couple should  Mr  Zahid  be  removed,  there  was  no  express
    reference to the section. As I understand it  Mr  Zahid's  wife  is  of
    Pakistani origin herself. They are both, as far as I am aware,  healthy
    adults. Although the joint witness statement  produced  by  the  couple
    submits that it would be "unjust" to expect them  to  uproot  and  move
    country, no reasons are advanced as to why leave should be granted with
    reference to EX.1(b). I find that this exception is not engaged.

18. Time has now moved on. Since the First-tier Tribunal hearing the couple
    have had a baby boy. He was born on the 25th February 2016  and  it  is
    not in dispute that he is a British national.  Nor  is  it  in  dispute
    that he is living in the United Kingdom with both his parents and  that
    he enjoys a genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  his
    father.  In accordance with EX.1 (a), Mr Zahid would today qualify  for
    leave to remain under the 'ten year route  to  settlement'  if  he  can
    establish that it would not be reasonable for his  son  to  leave  this
    country.  In assessing whether it would  be  'reasonable'  I  have  had
    regard to the Secretary of State's own guidance,  published  in  August
    2015 as the Immigration Directorates'  Instructions,  Family  Migration
    Appendix FM 1.0b Family Life as a Partner or Parent  Ten  Year  Routes.
    Under the heading 'would it be unreasonable to expect a  British  child
    to leave the United Kingdom?' that guidance reads, at 11.2.3:

         "Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker  must  not
         take a decision in relation to the parent or  primary  carer  of  a
         British Citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to
         force that British child to leave the EU, regardless of the age  of
         that child. This reflects the European Court of Justice judgment in
         Zambrano.

         ...

         Where a decision to refuse the application would require  a  parent
         or primary carer to return to a country outside the  EU,  the  case
         must always be assessed on the basis that it would be  unreasonable
         to expect a British citizen child to leave the EU with that  parent
         or primary carer.

         In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to  the
         parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in  the  UK  with
         the child, provided  that  there  is  satisfactory  evidence  of  a
         genuine subsisting parental relationship.

         It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where  the
         conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to considerations
         of such weight  as  to  justify  separation,  if  the  child  could
         otherwise stay with another parent or alternative primary carer  in
         the UK or the EU"

19. This guidance broadly accords with both the concession made in Sanade v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] UKUT 48 (IAC) and the
    reasoning in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705.   It  begins  from  the
    premise that a parent cannot be removed if the effect of  that  removal
    would be that a British child would have to  go  with  that  adult.  No
    doubt in accordance with our obligations under Article 8  it  does  not
    appear to restrict the application of the Zambrano principle to  single
    parents.   It  underlines  however  that   where   there   are   strong
    countervailing reasons, such as criminality, the  public  interest  may
    outweigh the interests of the child in question.

20. Applying those principles to this case, I find that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect Mr Zahid's son to leave the United  Kingdom.    He
    is a British citizen. The effect of his father's removal would be  that
    he and his mother would have to move to Pakistan with him in  order  to
    avoid an interference with family life.   An interference  with  family
    life at this important formative stage in the child's life  would  have
    profound  consequences  for  his  development.  There   has   been   no
    criminality in this case. As far as I can see Mr  Zahid  may  have  had
    some periods of stay in the United Kingdom when his leave  has  lapsed,
    but I note the First-tier  Tribunal'  findings  as  to  the  mitigating
    circumstances there: he was a Tier  4  student  who  lost  considerable
    amounts of time and money because his college sponsors'  licences  were
    repeatedly revoked.   There are no substantial  countervailing  factors
    weighing against Mr Zahid. I find that  the  exception  at  EX.1(a)  is
    engaged and that as of today's date, he meets the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules for entry into the ten-year route to settlement.

21. It follows that I need not dwell on Article 8 'outside  of  the  rules'
    since it is accepted by the Secretary of State  that  compliance  under
    the Rules leaves nothing on her side of the scales  when  it  comes  to
    weighing proportionality.  I address the Razgar  questions  only  as  a
    formality, and conscious that in  this  'old  style'  appeal  the  only
    matter in issue remains Article 8 'outside of the Rules'.

22. I find that there is a family life between Mr Zahid, his wife and  son.
    I find that his removal to Pakistan, regardless of when and whether  he
    could return, would amount to an interference with that family life and
    that Article 8 is engaged. I find that the decision  is  one  that  the
    Secretary of State is legally empowered to  take.  I  accept  that  the
    control of our borders is a measure rationally connected to the Article
    8(2) aim of protecting the economy. In my assessment of proportionality
    I must have regard to the factors set out in s117B of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

23. I find that the maintenance of immigration control  is  in  the  public
    interest. In this case Mr Zahid arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  with
    valid leave to enter, properly  extended  his  leave,  and  apart  from
    having the misfortune to attend colleges which have been closed down by
    the Home Office, has done his best to comply with  the  Rules.  I  have
    found that  at  the  date  of  this  in-country  appeal  he  meets  the
    requirements of the Rules.

24. Mr Zahid has passed  the  relevant  English  language  test  to  ensure
    compliance with the Rules. This  is  in  the  public  interest  because
    people who speak English are better able to integrate and are less of a
    burden on tax payers.

25. I find that Mr Zahid is financially independent.  He has made no claims
    on public funds since  his  arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom.  He  has
    demonstrated before me that the income of  his  household  is  well  in
    excess of the minimum income requirement and has been for  some  years.
    This is in the public  interest  because  people  who  are  financially
    independent are better able to integrate and are less of  a  burden  on
    tax payers.

26. I place little weight on any private life that Mr Zahid  has  developed
    since his arrival; his status has always been precarious.  Similarly  I
    place limited weight on his relationship with  his  wife  and  son.  In
    respect of the latter I must  take  into  account  the  fact  that  the
    child's relationship with his father exists absent any comprehension of
    immigration control or status, and that the sins  of  the  father   -if
    being a Tier 4 migrant can be considered  a  sin  in  this  context   -
    should not be visited  on  the  child  (see  for  instance  Makhlouf  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 59).  The status
    of his father is a matter entirely out of the  child's  control  and  I
    place significant  weight  on  his  relationship  with  his  dad:  Miah
    (section 117B - children) [2015] UKUT 131 (IAC).

27. That brings me to s117B(6). I have already found, with reference to the
    Respondent's own guidance, that it would not, in the  circumstances  of
    this case, be reasonable to expect Mr Zahid's son to leave. It  follows
    that this free standing provision (see MA (Pakistan)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    705 [at 14-20]) removes any weight settled in the Secretary of  State's
    side of the scales. The burden lies on the Secretary of State  to  show
    the decision to be proportionate, and in these circumstances  this  she
    cannot do. The appeal must therefore be allowed.




    Decisions

28. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law such that it should be set aside.

29. I remake the decision in the appeal by  allowing  it  on  human  rights
    grounds.

30. There is no direction for anonymity.
