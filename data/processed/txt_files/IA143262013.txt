                            Notice of Abandonment


 1. The Appellant is a female Albanian citizen born 23rd July 1983.

 2. By way of a decision promulgated on  16th  March  2015  the  First-tier
    Tribunal dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
    decision to refuse her leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    Appellant's application had been based upon her private life.

 3. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on
    14th July 2015.

 4. The Appellant did not attend the hearing before the Upper Tribunal.  Mr
    Mills advised that  the  Appellant  had  voluntarily  left  the  United
    Kingdom on 21st July 2015,  and  produced  extracts  from  Home  Office
    records confirming this.  Mr Mills submitted that the appeal  had  been
    abandoned.

 5. I am satisfied that the Appellant voluntarily left the  United  Kingdom
    on 21st July 2015.  I set out below section 92(8) of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002;

         "Where an Appellant brings an appeal from within the United Kingdom
         but  leaves  the  United  Kingdom  before  the  appeal  is  finally
         determined, the appeal is to be treated  as  abandoned  unless  the
         claim to which the appeal relates has been certified under  section
         94(1) or (7) or section 94B."

 6. The Appellant's claim had not been certified and therefore  the  appeal
    must be treated as abandoned, as the  Appellant  voluntarily  left  the
    United Kingdom after bringing her appeal.

 7. A notice is to be sent to the parties  pursuant  to  rule  17A  of  The
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  confirming  that  the
    appeal is being treated as abandoned.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is abandoned.

No anonymity direction is made.
