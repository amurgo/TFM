                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Awan, Counsel instructed by Mayfair Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       dismissing the appeal of the appellant against the decision  of  the
       Secretary of State refusing leave to remain on human rights grounds.



    2. Permission to appeal was given by First-tier Tribunal Judge Page and
       although the grounds refer more  to  matters  of  weight  than  hard
       errors of law, the clear arguable point identified by Judge Page was
       that it was at least arguable that legally insufficient  weight  had
       been given to the rights of the appellant's child who is  a  British
       citizen, then aged approximately 4 months.

    3. Mr Clark has had an opportunity of considering  the  papers  and  on
       behalf of the Secretary of  State  has  accepted  that  insufficient
       weight is given as a matter of law and  that  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier  Tribunal  should  be  set  aside  and  that  we   should
       substitute a decision allowing the appeal on  human  rights  grounds
       which is what we do.



Notice of Decision


The First-tier  Tribunal  erred  I  law.  We  set  aside  its  decision  and
substitute  a  decision  allowing  the  appeal  against   the   Respondent's
decision.
