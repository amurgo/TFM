Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission on
      20 May  2013  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kebede  in  respect  of  the
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Place  who  dismissed  the
      appeal by way of a determination promulgated on 1 February 2013.

   2.       The appellant is a Bangladeshi national born on 15 June 1986. He
      seeks entry clearance as a family visitor for a period of two  months.
      The application was refused on 26 June 2012 because the  ECO  was  not
      satisfied that the appellant was genuinely seeking entry as a  visitor
      for the period claimed or that he intended to leave the UK at the  end
      of  that  period  or  that  he  would  be  adequately  maintained   or
      accommodated.

   3.       The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant's sponsor  (and
      brother-in-law), Abu Hanif. He found the information  was  sketchy  in
      respect of the appellant's circumstances. He noted that the  appellant
      had made two previous visits to the UK  in  2008  and  2009  and  that
      though he had returned within the validity of his visa, he had  stayed
      far longer than the limited period he had claimed he would  stay  for.
      Nevertheless he found that the appellant  had  ties  in  the  form  of
      family in Bangladesh and he concluded that the appellant did,  on  the
      balance  of  probabilities,  intend  a  genuine  visit.  However,   he
      dismissed the appeal on the basis that the  appellant  had  failed  to
      show evidence of adequate maintenance and accommodation. He also found
      that there was a good  chance  that  the  appellant's  visit  on  this
      occasion would be longer than the  two  months  he  had  sought  entry
      clearance for. Accordingly, he dismissed the appeal.

   4.       Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that the judge was
      arguably wrong to have dismissed the  appeal  given  the  evidence  of
      accommodation from the sponsor  and  of  funds  from  the  appellant's
      father.

Appeal hearing

   5.       The appeal came before me on 22 July 2013. The sponsor  attended
      the hearing.

   6.       I heard submissions from  Mr  Bhuyian  who  submitted  that  the
      sponsor and appellant had been  found  credible  and  that  the  judge
      should, therefore, have proceeded to allow the  appeal.  He  submitted
      that the appellant had provide explanations as to why  he  had  stayed
      longer than planned on his previous visits but pointed out that he had
      not breached the Immigration Rules. He submitted  that  the  appellant
      was being given ï¿½1200 by his father and  he  had  not  given  adequate
      reasons as to why, in the context  of  the  Asian  family  system  and
      culture, this was not  sufficient.  He  accepted  there  had  been  no
      documentary evidence as to accommodation at the hearing but said  that
      the appellant had stayed with the sponsor on the  last  two  occasions
      and his evidence on that should be accepted.

   7.       In response,  Mr  Walker  submitted  that  the  judge  had  been
      entitled to find that there had been no satisfactory  evidence  as  to
      maintenance and accommodation. The findings he made had been  open  to
      him. There was no material error of law.

   8.       Mr Bhuiyan replied.  He  stated  that  the  appellant  had  been
      unrepresented at the last hearing and it had been open to the judge to
      have asked questions of the sponsor at the time had  he  had  concerns
      over the adequacy of accommodation.

   9.       At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  determination
      which I now give.

Conclusions

  10.       The judge was satisfied  that  the  appellant  would  return  to
      Bangladesh but was not satisfied as to whether he would stay  for  the
      short period requested or would again stay for some five months as  he
      had done previously. He was not satisfied, given the uncertainty as to
      the duration of the  stay,  as  to  the  adequacy  of  funding  or  of
      accommodation.

  11.        Having considered the determination and the submissions made, I
      reach the following conclusions.

  12.       The concerns of the ECO as to the appellant's  intentions,  what
      he would do here during his visit and matters relating to  maintenance
      and accommodation were all raised in the refusal.  The  appellant  and
      sponsor were on notice that these issues had to be  addressed  yet  no
      documentary evidence was adduced in this respect  and,  as  the  judge
      noted,  the  sponsor's  evidence  was  sketchy  on   the   appellant's
      circumstances and finances.  Some questions were put to the sponsor by
      the judge but it was not for him to question the sponsor closely.

  13.       It is said that the appellant stayed with  the  sponsor  on  his
      last visits but that is not supported by the appellant's own evidence.
      A letter from an NHS hospital in Grimsby and two prescriptions from  a
      GP with whom he  registered  here  show  the  appellant's  address  as
      "Indian Flavour", a restaurant  in  Mablethorpe  and  not  at  12  The
      Laurels which is the sponsor's address. There is no information as  to
      the size of the sponsor's property, the occupancy or the situation  as
      regards the mortgage or rent.  Mr Bhuiyan acknowledged no  documentary
      evidence of same had been provided for the assistance of the judge.

  14.       With regard to maintenance, the judge was  entitled  to  express
      the concerns he did. The affidavits are not  independent  evidence  of
      the availability of funds and the sponsor was unable  to  assist  with
      details regarding the appellant's financial circumstances. I note that
      the sponsor brought along bank cards to show the  judge  but  no  bank
      statements were provided.

  15.       It was open to the judge  to  make  some  positive  findings  in
      respect of the sponsor and appellant yet to dismiss the appeal on  the
      basis that he did not have adequate evidence as to  the  live  issues.
      His approach shows no error  and  his  findings  and  conclusions  are
      sustainable.

Decision

  16.       The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  error  of  law.  The
      determination dismissing the appeal stands.
