                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                            Raphael Jorge Atanda
                                                                  Respondent
                             NOTICE OF DECISION

 1. The appellant has an  appeal  outstanding  before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    listed on the 12th December 2017.  By  email  dated  8th  December  the
    Secretary of State has stated that she no longer pursues the grounds of
    appeal and wishes to withdraw her case.

 2. Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  provides
    that a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case or any  part
    of it, subject to the consent  of  the  Upper  Tribunal.  There  is  no
    provision for a party to withdraw the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.
    Therefore, the letter from the Secretary of State can serve only  as  a
    notice of withdrawal of her case before the Upper  Tribunal,  to  which
    the Upper Tribunal now consents. There is no challenge to  the  finding
    of fact made  by  the  FTT  that  the  relationships  are  genuine  and
    subsisting and that there is a permanent transfer of the twins to their
    care and thus there are three qualifying children.

 3. Consequently there  is  no  challenge  to  the  case  advanced  by  the
    respondent and the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is
    dismissed.

 4. Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
