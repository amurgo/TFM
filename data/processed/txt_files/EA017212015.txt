                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
        George promulgated on 28 November 2016 in which the Judge dismissed
        the appellant's appeal.





Error of law finding


     2. The appellant, a  Ghanaian  national  born  on  21  December  1990,
        applied for a Residence Card on the  basis  he  was  in  a  genuine
        relationship with his  sponsor,  an  Austrian  national  exercising
        treaty rights in the United Kingdom.
     3. The application was refused as it was not considered the  appellant
        was validly married  and  that  the  marriage  was  a  marriage  of
        convenience.
     4. The Judge noted that the first issue to be considered  was  whether
        the sponsor was a qualified person, namely  a  student  within  the
        meaning of Regulation 6(1)(e) which required the  sponsor  to  have
        comprehensive sickness insurance and have sufficient resources  not
        become a burden on the  social  assistance  system  of  the  United
        Kingdom during her period of residence.  The Judge  noted  that  it
        was only if the sponsor can satisfy  those  requirements  that  the
        Tribunal can  look  at  whether  or  not  this  is  a  marriage  of
        convenience [15].
     5. Having analysed the evidence the Judge did not accept the appellant
        and sponsor had discharged the burden of proof  upon  them  to  the
        required standard to prove the sponsor was a qualified person.  The
        Judge notes in particular that there was no documentary evidence to
        show there was comprehensive sickness insurance  in  place  between
        June 2015 and January 2016 [46 - 53]. At [53] the Judge writes:


             "In summary, the documentary evidence does not show  that  the
             sponsor was a student for the academic year beginning  October
             2015; nor does it show that they  had  comprehensive  sickness
             insurance from June 2015 to January 2016  and  that  they  are
             self-sufficient. I do not have documentary evidence to support
             when the sponsor went to Austria and for how long.


     6. In relation to the challenge to the validity of  the  marriage  the
        Judge sets out findings in  relation  to  the  credibility  of  the
        appellants claim between  [55  -  61]  in  which  the  Judge  noted
        contradictions in  the  evidence  and  a  lack  of  consistency  in
        relation to core aspects.
     7. The Judge summarises his findings at [63 -  64]  in  the  following
        terms:


             63.  In considering the totality of the  evidence  and  having
                  identified   that   the   appellant   and   sponsor   lack
                  credibility, I am not satisfied that the  sponsor  is  and
                  was a student at the date of the application or  that  she
                  was a student up until June/July 2016. I am not  satisfied
                  that they had comprehensive insurance  between  June  2015
                  and January 2016.  I  am  satisfied  that  they  have  had
                  comprehensive insurance from January 2016 to date based on
                  the bank statements filed. I am not  satisfied  that  they
                  were and are self-sufficient for the reasons set out above
                  (a  lack  of  documentary  evidence  and   the   lack   of
                  credibility). I am not satisfied to the requisite standard
                  therefore that  the  sponsor  is  a  qualified  person  in
                  accordance with the Regulations.


             64.  If I were to be wrong about that,  I  consider  that  the
                  Secretary of State has  satisfied  the  evidential  burden
                  that this marriage was entered into  for  the  predominant
                  purpose of securing residence rights for all  the  reasons
                  identified above. I have borne in mind the dicta  set  out
                  by the Court of Appeal in Agho v  SSHD  [2015]]  EWCA  Civ
                  1198 at paragraph 13 that "as  a  matter  of  principle  a
                  spouse establishes a primer facie case that he or she is a
                  family member of an EEA national by providing the marriage
                  certificate and  the  spouses  passport;  that  the  legal
                  burden is on the Secretary  of  State  to  show  that  any
                  marriage thus proved is a marriage of convenience and that
                  the burden is not discharged merely by showing  reasonable
                  suspicion". The prima fascia case on the  basis  of  their
                  marriage certificate has been rebutted by  the  appellants
                  and sponsor's own oral evidence as set out above with  the
                  fact they could not remember the date of marriage and even
                  how it was celebrated and asserting that the marriage  was
                  wrong but having done nothing to rectify it  being  highly
                  significant.


     8. The Judge did not find it has been established that the sponsor  is
        a qualified person exercising treaty  rights  and  found  that  the
        marriage  is  one  of  convenience  leading  to  the  appeal  being
        dismissed.
     9. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
        another judge of the First-tier Tribunal. The appeal was listed for
        an Initial hearing before the Upper Tribunal on Monday the 24  July
        2017 and notices of hearing validly served upon both the  appellant
        and the appellant's representatives at the addresses  provided  for
        service. There was no attendance by or on the  appellant's  behalf.
        The court clerk, in addition to calling the case on  at  10  AM  to
        establish  whether  there  was  any  attendance,   telephoned   the
        appellants representative at 11 AM when he was  advised  that  they
        had been instructed by their client not to attend the hearing.  The
        representative indicated a  fax  would  be  sent  confirming  their
        instructions. When the case was called on for hearing at 12 noon no
        one had attended to pursue the  claim.  There  was  no  adjournment
        application  and  the  demands  of  fairness  and  the   overriding
        objectives did not require the hearing not to proceed.
    10. The grounds on which permission to appeal  was  sought  argued  the
        Judge had erred in her analysis and consideration  of  whether  the
        sponsor  had  exercised  treaty  rights  and  that  the  Judge  had
        misinterpreted and not considered material evidence and  had  erred
        in law in requiring the appellant and the sponsor to demonstrate  a
        sum of ï¿½1029.20p each  month  which,  it  was  argued,  was  not  a
        requirement of the EEA regulations.
    11. A person making an allegation is required to  do  more  than  plead
        alleged errors. The grant of permission to  appeal  indicates  that
        the grounds on which permission to appeal is sought maybe arguable,
        but nothing further. They do not find as  a  matter  of  fact  that
        legal error has been made or established that  any  such  error  is
        material to the decision to allow or dismiss the appeal.
    12. The failure of the appellant or his representatives to attend means
        the Upper Tribunal has no more than the bare assertions pleaded  in
        the application  for  permission  to  appeal.  The  application  is
        opposed by the Presenting Officer.
    13. It is the finding of this tribunal that the appellant has failed to
        discharge the burden of proof upon him to the required standard  to
        establish any error of law material to the decision to dismiss  the
        appeal under the EEA Regulations in the decision  under  challenge.
        Accordingly, that decision shall stand.



Decision

    14. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    15. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
