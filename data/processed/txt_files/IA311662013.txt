For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant's appeal against decisions to refuse to  vary  his  leave
    and to remove him  by  way  of  directions  under  section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act  2006  (the  adverse  decisions
    being made on 2nd July 2013) was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Mayall ("the judge") in a determination promulgated on 26th June  2014.



2.   The judge determined  the  appeal  on  the  basis  of  the  documentary
    evidence before him, in the light of the appellant's  indication  in  a
    fax sent to the First-tier Tribunal that he wished  the  appeal  to  be
    determined in this way.

3.   The judge noted the  Secretary  of  State's  finding  in  her  decision
    letter that the appellant had not submitted  any  bank  statements,  in
    spite of being given an opportunity to do so.  In the notice of appeal,
    there was an assertion that such documents were submitted.   The  judge
    took into account the appellant's decision that he did  not  require  a
    hearing, at which he might have given oral evidence and found that  the
    appellant had  not  shown  that  the  necessary  bank  statements  were
    provided with his application and so the requirements of the rules were
    not met.  The judge went on to consider Article 8 of the  Human  Rights
    Convention,  taking  into  account  guidance  given  in  recent  cases,
    including Nasim [2014] UKUT 00025.  He concluded that  the  appellant's
    case contained no compelling circumstances and  found  that  the  human
    rights grounds of appeal were not made out.

4.   The appellant applied for permission to  appeal,  contending  that  the
    judge erred in law by accepting the Secretary  of  State's  claim  that
    bank statements were not provided with the application or by  2nd  July
    2013, the time allowed by her for submitting the documents.  The  judge
    failed to consider documents which accompanied the  notice  of  appeal,
    including a copy of a letter from a bank and a  bank  statement  and  a
    special delivery receipt, dated 1st July 2013.  This showed  that  bank
    statements were sent to the respondent and received by the Home  Office
    on 2nd July 2013.  The judge failed to consider material evidence.  His
    Article 8 assessment was clouded by his finding that  the  requirements
    of the rules were not met.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted on 21st July 2014 on  the  basis  that
    it was arguable that an error had resulted from an apparent failure  to
    make findings regarding evidence served with the notice of appeal.

6.   In directions sent by the Principal Resident Judge,  the  parties  were
    advised that they should prepare for the Upper Tribunal hearing on  the
    basis that if an error of law were found and the decision  fell  to  be
    remade, any further evidence could be considered at the hearing.

The Hearing

7.   Notice of the hearing was sent to  the  appellant  at  the  address  he
    provided to the First-tier Tribunal on  15th  April  2014.   This  same
    address appeared in his application for  permission  to  appeal,  dated
    10th July 2014.  There was no appearance by him and enquiries  revealed
    that no message had been left.  I was  satisfied  that  notice  of  the
    hearing had been properly served on the appellant  at  the  address  he
    provided and that it was just to proceed in his absence.  There was  no
    application for an adjournment and nothing to suggest that the position
    would be any different on another day.

8.   Ms Kenny said that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  contained
    no material error of law.  The judge  did  not  refer  to  the  special
    delivery receipt slip or documents  which  accompanied  the  notice  of
    appeal but there was no error as, in fact, no  bank  statement  meeting
    the requirements of the rules was made available by the  appellant,  in
    support of his application.  The document the appellant drew  attention
    to in his application for permission to appeal, and which he  described
    as a bank statement, was in fact a "Statement of  Account".   This  was
    apparently issued by the NCC Bank Ltd in Dhaka.  The document  included
    an "Account opening date" of 21st May 2013 and referred to a period  of
    time beginning on that date and ending on  26th  June  2013.   All  the
    document showed was a cash deposit, made on 21st May 2013, in  the  sum
    of 1,100,000 taka.  The document merely recorded the deposit  and  gave
    the balance.  The other document the appellant referred to was a letter
    from the bank addressed "To Whom it May Concern".  This  came  from  an
    unidentified person, described as an "Authorized  Officer",  purporting
    to certify that the appellant had an account, described  as  a  "Saving
    Deposit (SB) Account", with a credit balance of 1,100,000 taka,  as  at
    26th June 2013.  Whether the documents were  considered  separately  or
    together, the evidence did not show that the appellant  held  the  cash
    for the required minimum period of 28 days.  The statement did not show
    the closing balance or indeed any transactions and the letter  did  not
    show the balance in the account at any time before 26th June 2013.

9.   Even if the evidence did arrive with the Secretary of  State  and  even
    if it had been considered, the same conclusion would have been reached.
     The appellant had not shown that he was in possession of  the  minimum
    amount of ï¿½1,600 for a period of  28  consecutive  days.   He  was  not
    entitled to the points claimed in  the  Maintenance  (Funds)  category.
    Similarly, the judge was entitled to conclude that the requirements  of
    the rules were  not  met,  even  without  expressly  referring  to  the
    documents that the appellant relied upon.

10.  Ms Kenny said that the Secretary of  State  also  had  a  second  point
    available.  The special delivery receipt showed that the documents were
    sent on 1st July 2013.  In the decision letter, the Secretary of  State
    referred to a request sent to the appellant by  e-mail,  giving  him  a
    further seven days from 25th  June  2013  for  bank  statements  to  be
    submitted, the deadline being 2nd  July  2013.   The  special  delivery
    receipt showed that the documents were "posted after last  collection",
    at "22:50" on 1st July and so there would have been no collection until
    2nd July and no receipt by the Secretary of State until  the  following
    day, 3rd July, in accordance with  the  special  delivery  scheme.   It
    followed that the documents were not submitted in accordance  with  the
    time allowed by the Secretary of State.

11.  So far as Article 8 was concerned, there was nothing of  any  substance
    in the appellant's case that the judge was required to deal with.   The
    grounds of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  were  formulaic  and
    contained no details.

Conclusions on Error of Law

12.  I am very grateful to Ms Kenny for her  careful  submissions,  which  I
    accept.  The judge did not refer to documents accompanying  the  notice
    of appeal but, even  supposing  that  the  items  referred  to  by  the
    appellant in his application for permission  to  appeal  were  properly
    before the judge, no material error is  shown  in  the  decision  made.
    There is no need to repeat Ms Kenny's analysis of  the  two  documents.
    It is clear that the statement of account is  not  sufficient  to  show
    that the appellant held the minimum level of  funds  for  the  required
    period of 28 consecutive days because it recorded only  a  deposit  of
    cash on 21st May 2013.  The letter from the bank, not a bank  statement
    as such, adds nothing substantial to the case because  it  records  the
    balance of the funds in the account as at 26th June 2013 but not at any
    time beforehand.

13.  The special delivery receipt also shows that it  is  more  likely  than
    not that the documents were not received by the Secretary of  State  in
    the time allowed, so that she was entitled on 2nd  July  2013  to  find
    that bank statements had not been submitted.  The date and time of  the
    special delivery receipt is 22:50  on 1st July 2013 and  the  documents
    were "posted after last collection".  Any items sent by  the  appellant
    would have been collected on 2nd July and delivered the following  day.
    Even if received within the time allowed, the documents relied upon  by
    the appellant were in any event insufficient to show that  he  met  the
    requirements of the rules.

14.  So far as Article 8 is concerned, the grounds of appeal to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal are indeed formulaic.  There is  an  assertion  that  the
    appellant provided "All  the  required  documents  in  support  of  his
    application before the date of decision" and  the  following  on  human
    rights:  "The decision is unlawful as it  is  a  clear  breach  of  the
    appellant's rights afforded by the ECHR".  There is no  detail  of  any
    ties established by the appellant in the United Kingdom, following  his
    arrival in the  autumn  of  2009.   The  judge's  conclusion  that  the
    appellant could not succeed on Article 8 grounds was manifestly open to
    him on the limited evidence available.

15.  No material error of law has been shown and  so  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, dismissing the appeal, shall stand.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of  law
    and shall stand.

ANONYMITY

There  has  been  no  application  for  anonymity  at  any  stage  in  these
proceedings and I make no direction on this occasion.
