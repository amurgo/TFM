Representation:

For the appellant:      Mr Z Malik, Counsel, instructed by Fisherwright
Solicitors
For the respondent:     Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

(1) The word "partner" is  not  defined  in  Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The definition of "partner" in GEN 1.2  of
Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules  does  not  govern  the  way  in  which
"partner" is to be interpreted in Part 5A.

(2) A person who satisfies the definition in GEN 1.2 should,  as  a  general
matter, be regarded as being a partner for the purposes of Part  5A,  Where,
however, a person does not fall within that definition, the judge will  need
to undertake a broad evaluative assessment of the relationship,  bearing  in
mind that a "partner" is a person  to  whom  one  has  a  genuine  emotional
attachment, of the same basic kind as one sees  between  spouses  and  civil
partners, albeit not necessarily characterised by  present  cohabitation.  A
"partner" is not the same as a friend;  nor  is  an  adolescent's  or  other
young person's boyfriend or girlfriend necessarily a "partner".

(3) The fact that, in the absence of  a  statutory  definition,  judges  may
reach different conclusions as to whether an individual has  been  shown  to
be another person's partner is unlikely to  pose  significant  difficulties,
since  the  fundamental  question  in  section  117C(5)  is  the  effect  of
deportation on the partner. A relationship which is categorised as  that  of
partners, where the parties have only recently met and  are  not  cohabiting
is, in general, far less likely to generate unduly  harsh  consequences  for
the remaining partner, if the foreign criminal is  deported,  compared  with
where a relationship is longstanding and  there  has  been  significant  co-
habitation.

(4) Where,  conversely,  a  relationship  is  not  categorised  as  that  of
partners, it will still be necessary to consider the effect  of  deportation
on the other person, by reference to section 117C(6).  In the  light  of  NA
(Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
662, it is the substance of the relationship that needs to be examined  and,
in this type of case, it will be productive of error to draw  too  bright  a
line between section 117C(5) and (6).


                            DECISION AND REASONS


A. WHO IS A "PARTNER" FOR THE PURPOSES OF PART 5A OF THE NATIONALITY,
IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM ACT 2002?

 1. This case concerns the meaning of the word "partner" in Part 5A of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  As is by now very  well-
    known, Part 5A requires a court or  tribunal  to  have  regard  to  the
    considerations  listed  in  section  117B  and,  in  the  case  of  the
    deportation of foreign criminals, the considerations listed in  section
    117C, when considering whether an interference with a person's right to
    respect for private and family life is justified under Article 8(2)  of
    the ECHR.

 2. Section 117D (Interpretation of this part) provides that:-

         "Article 8" means Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human
         Rights;


         "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age  of  18  and
         who-


         (a)  is a British citizen, or


         (b)  has lived in the United Kingdom for  a  continuous  period  of
              seven years or more;

         "qualifying partner" means a partner who-


         (a)  is a British citizen, or


         (b)  who is settled in the United Kingdom (within  the  meaning  of
             the Immigration Act 1971-see section 33(2A) of that Act)."

 3. Section 117B(4) provides that:-

         "(4) Little weight should be given to-


             (a)  a private life, or


             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that  is
                  established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully."

 4. Section 117C(1) declares that the deportation of foreign  criminals  is
    in the public interest.  Subsection (2) says that the more serious  the
    offence committed by a foreign criminal,  the  greater  is  the  public
    interest in deportation of that criminal.

 5. In respect of a foreign criminal who has not been sentenced to a period
    of imprisonment of four years or more, section 117C(3) states that  the
    public interest requires the criminal's deportation unless Exception  1
    or Exception 2 applies.

 6.  Section 117C(5) and (6) provide:-

         "(5) Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.


           (6)    In the case of a foreign criminal who has  been  sentenced
             to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
             interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2."

B. DOES THE DEFINITION IN GEN. 1.2 OF APPENDIX FM APPLY TO PART 5A?

 7. The respondent's primary position, which was accepted by the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge in the present case, is that the definition of "partner"
    in Part 5A of the 2002 Act is supplied by the definition in GEN.1.2. of
    Appendix FM (Family members).  GEN.1.2. reads as follows:-

         "GEN.1.2.     For the purposes of this Appendix "partner" means-
         (i)  the applicant's spouse;
         (ii) the applicant's civil partner;
         (iii)    the applicant's fiancï¿½(e) or proposed civil partner; or
         (iv) a person who has been living together with the applicant in  a
             relationship akin to a marriage or civil  partnership  for  at
             least two years prior to the date  of  application,  unless  a
             different  meaning  of  partner  applies  elsewhere  in   this
             Appendix."
 8. In support of her primary position, the respondent draws  attention  to
    the statement in paragraph 25 of El Gazzaz v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 532 by Sales LJ that:-

         "25. The statutory provisions in Part 5A of the 2002 Act mirror the
             Immigration Rules in relation to foreign criminals which  were
             brought into effect at the same time as Part  5A:  see  paras.
             398 to 399A of the Immigration Rules as made in July 2014."

 9. The respondent says that this finding is reflected in  the  Ministerial
    statement of the then Minister  for  Security  and  Immigration  (James
    Brokenshire) who, on 10 July 2014, told the House of Commons that:-

         "My Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary is  today  laying  before  the
         House a Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules ...  The  changes
         also align the Immigration Rules on family and private life in Part
         13, which relate to foreign criminals,  with  the  public  interest
         considerations in sections 117B and 117C of the  2002  Act.   These
         considerations are inserted by section 19 of  the  Immigration  Act
         2014."
10. The problem with this aspect of the respondent's case is that there  is
    no  definition  of  "partner"  in  paragraph  6   (interpretation)   or
    paragraphs 398 to 399A of the Immigration Rules.  Accordingly, the fact
    that references in paragraphs  398  to  399A  to  "partner"  should  be
    interpreted in the same way as in Part 5A of the 2002  Act  in  no  way
    advances the argument that the definition in GEN.1.2. should apply both
    to Part 5A and paragraphs  398  to  399A.   Given  their  similarities,
    section 117C and paragraphs 398 to  399A  should,  we  agree,  share  a
    common meaning of "partner". Whether that definition should be the  one
    found in GEN.1.2. of Appendix FM is, however, another matter.

11. For the appellant, Mr Malik  makes  two  characteristically  pithy  but
    important points.  First, he draws attention to the  opening  words  of
    GEN.1.2., where, as we can see, "partner" is defined "for the  purposes
    of this Appendix".  If the definition were intended to have  any  wider
    scope, Mr Malik submits that GEN.1.2. would have said so.

12. Secondly, Mr Malik submits that, as a matter of law,  a  definition  in
    subordinate legislation or the  Immigration  Rules  cannot  govern  the
    interpretation of an expression found in  primary  legislation.   As  a
    general matter, we agree.  In the absence of an express  power  in  the
    parent Act to bring about such a situation,  it  is  not  open  to  the
    Executive, through the medium of subordinate legislation, to change the
    way in which the primary  legislation  operates.   That  would  be  the
    result if such subordinate provisions were to dictate the meaning of an
    expression in primary legislation. In particular, Mr Malik pointed  out
    that any change to the definition in the subordinate provisions  would,
    in effect, amend the primary legislation.

C.  HOW TO INTERPRET "PARTNER" IN PART 5A

13. There is, accordingly, no merit in the respondent's  primary  position.
    How, then, should the expression "partner" in Part 5A  be  interpreted?
    For the respondent, Mr Lindsay says that, unless the expression denotes
    a relationship of some substance and  significance,  the  operation  of
    Exception 2 in section 117C(5) will, in these cases, depend solely upon
    whether there is "a genuine and subsisting  relationship"  between  the
    foreign criminal and another person.  If that had been the intention of
    the legislature, Mr Lindsay says, there would have been no need to  use
    the expression "partner".

14. It is,  we  consider,  evident  that,  in  framing  the  definition  of
    "partner" in GEN.1.2., the respondent is attempting, in paragraph (iv),
    to identify a form of relationship, not amounting to actual or proposed
    marriage or civil partnership, which, as a general matter, is likely to
    deserve respect as a protected form of family life within Article 8  of
    the ECHR.  The fact that paragraph (iv) is not the only  way  in  which
    one can identify "partners" who are not actual or intended  spouses  or
    civil partners is recognised in the closing words  of  GEN.1.2.,  where
    the possibility of "a different meaning  of  partner"  is  contemplated
    "elsewhere in this Appendix".

15. Although the paradigm of family life, as enjoyed by  partners,  whether
    or married or in civil partnerships, or not, is  cohabitation,  we  are
    not aware that the Strasbourg caselaw on Article 8 is so confined.   It
    is possible for a couple, who are not married, in a  civil  partnership
    or formally intending to be so, to enjoy protected  family  life,  even
    though they do not cohabit.  Individuals may commit to each other, in a
    genuine and meaningful way, without full-time cohabitation.

16. Interestingly,  in  the  definition  of  "extended  family  member"  in
    regulation 8 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016, we find this:-

         "(5) The condition in this paragraph is  that  the  person  is  the
             partner (other than a civil partner)  of,  and  in  a  durable
             relationship with, an EEA national ..., and is able  to  prove
             this to the decision maker."

17.  This  definition  suggests  that,  for  the  purposes  of   the   2016
    Regulations, a person can be a "partner" of another, even if  they  are
    not in a durable relationship.  To that extent,  the  2016  Regulations
    push against the submission of Mr Lindsay, that  "partner"  must  carry
    something more than that the person concerned  is  in  a  "genuine  and
    subsisting relationship" with another person.

18. Nevertheless, Mr  Lindsay's  basic  point  remains  a  good  one.   The
    expression "partner" means a person to whom one has a genuine emotional
    commitment, of the same basic kind as  one  sees  between  spouses  and
    civil  partners,  albeit  not  necessarily  characterised  by   present
    cohabitation.  A "partner" is not the same as a friend, however  strong
    the friendship may be.  Nor is an adolescent's or other young  person's
    boyfriend or girlfriend necessarily a  "partner".   The  position  may,
    however, change if the relationship becomes  sufficiently  serious  and
    committed.

19. With this in mind, we return to the question we posed in  paragraph  12
    above.  The starting position, we find, is that  anyone  who  satisfies
    the definition of "partner" in GEN.1.2. should, as a general matter, be
    regarded as being a "partner" for the purposes of  Part  5A.   Where  a
    person does not fall within this definition, the  judge  will  need  to
    undertake a broad evaluative assessment  of  the  relationship,  having
    regard to the factors we have described.

D. DOES THE ABSENCE OF A STATUTORY DEFINITION MATTER?

20. The fact that there is no statutory definition of "partner" in Part 5A,
    in contrast to the definition of "qualifying child", means that,  in  a
    case of the kind with which we  are  concerned,  different  judges  may
    reach different conclusions as to  whether,  on  a  particular  set  of
    facts, an individual has been shown to be another person's partner.

21. In practice, we do not consider this is likely to pose any  significant
    difficulties. This is  because  the  fundamental  question  in  section
    117C(5) is the effect of deportation on the partner  (or  child).   The
    nature and strength of the relationship between  the  foreign  criminal
    and that of another person, said to be a partner, will directly  inform
    whether deportation of the foreign  criminal  would  have  consequences
    that are unduly harsh for that other person.  Given that  there  is  no
    material difference between paragraphs 398 to 399A of  the  Immigration
    Rules and section 117C(3) to (6) of the 2002  Act  (see  CI  Nigeria  v
    Secretary of State for the Department [2019] EWCA Civ 2027: Leggatt  LJ
    at [20]), in order for Exception 2 to operate, it must  be  shown  both
    that it would be unduly harsh for the  alleged  partner  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom and that it would be unduly harsh for him/her to remain,
    without the physical presence of the foreign criminal.  A  relationship
    which is categorised as that of partners, where the parties  have  only
    recently met and are not cohabiting is, in general, far less likely  to
    generate  unduly  harsh  consequences,  if  the  foreign  criminal   is
    deported, compared with where a relationship is longstanding and  there
    has been significant co-habitation.

22. If a relationship is not categorised by the judge as that of  partners,
    in every case of criminal deportation, whether or not the  sentence  of
    imprisonment is four years  or  more,  the  judge  must  apply  section
    117C(6): see NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    and Others [2016] EWCA  Civ  662;  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v PF (Nigeria) [2019] EWCA Civ 1139.   It  is  only  by  the
    operation of section 117C(6) that the judge ensures that Part 5A of the
    2002 Act, produces, in every case of deportation of a foreign criminal,
    a result that is compatible with the United Kingdom's obligations under
    Article 8.

23. Accordingly, where a relationship, relied upon by the foreign  criminal
    to defeat deportation, is not treated by  the  judge  as  falling  with
    section 117C(5) because the other person  is  not  categorised  as  the
    foreign criminal's  partner,  it  will  nevertheless  be  necessary  to
    consider the effect of deportation on that other person,  in  order  to
    determine  whether  deportation  would  constitute  a  disproportionate
    interference with that other person's Article  8  rights  (as  well  as
    those of the foreign criminal).

24. The fact that section 117C(6) speaks of "very compelling circumstances,
    over and above those described in Exceptions ...  2"  might,  at  first
    sight, be said to impose a higher burden on the foreign  criminal  than
    would be the case if the other person had been found to be his  or  her
    partner.  That is not, however, necessarily the position.

25. In NA (Pakistan), Jackson LJ  examined,  in  considerable  detail,  the
    interplay  between  section  117C(5)  and  (6).   In  particular,   the
    following paragraph is of relevance:-

         "32. Similarly, in the case of a medium offender, [that is to  say,
             a person sentenced to imprisonment of at least twelve  months,
             but not of four years or more] if  all  he  could  advance  in
             support of his Article 8 claim was a "near miss" case in which
             he fell short of bringing himself within either Exception 1 or
             Exception 2, it would not be possible to say that he had shown
             that there were "very compelling circumstances, over and above
             those described in Exceptions 1 and 2".  He would need to have
             a far stronger case than that by reference  to  the  interests
             protected by Article 8 to bring himself within that fall  back
             protection.  But again, in principle there  may  be  cases  in
             which such an offender can say that features of his case of  a
             kind described in Exceptions 1 and 2 have such great force for
             Article  8  purposes  that  they  do  constitute   such   very
             compelling circumstances, whether taken by  themselves  or  in
             conjunction with other factors relevant to Article 8  but  not
             falling within the factors described in Exceptions  1  and  2.
             The decision  maker,  be  it  the  Secretary  of  State  or  a
             tribunal,  must  look  at  all   the   matters   relied   upon
             collectively,  in  order  to  determine   whether   they   are
             sufficiently compelling to outweigh the high  public  interest
             in deportation."

26. Accordingly, where a relationship  is  not  considered  to  be  one  of
    partners, it will still be necessary to consider whether the effect  of
    deportation on the other person would be so serious as to amount  to  a
    disproportionate interference with Article 8  rights.   Of  course,  in
    reality it will not frequently be the case that a  relationship,  which
    is not that of a  partner  but  which  was  "of  a  kind  described  in
    Exceptions 1 and 2", would lead the foreign criminal to  success  under
    section 117C(6).  But the important message to take from  Jackson  LJ's
    judgment is that there can be situations where it will  be   productive
    of error to draw too bright a line between subsections (5) and (6),  at
    least in cases of "medium offenders" that are not  concerned  with  so-
    called near-misses but where the relevant matters are similar  to,  but
    not actually within, Exception 2. What  this  means  is  that,  in  our
    particular type of case, the substance of the relationship between  the
    foreign criminal and the  other  person  needs  to  be  examined  under
    section 117C(6),  whether  or  not  that  other  person  is  judicially
    regarded as a partner.

27. As we have seen, section 117B(4)(b) requires a judicial  decision-maker
    to give little weight  to  a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying
    partner, which is established by a person at a time when that person is
    in the United Kingdom unlawfully.   Here,  it  matters  not  whether  a
    person,  in  the  circumstances  with  which  we  are   concerned,   is
    categorised as a partner.  Where the broad evaluative examination which
    we have described results in the asserted partner not being regarded as
    such by the judge, it would clearly be wrong if that  relationship  was
    given more weight than it would have had, if the relationship had  been
    categorised as that of a partner.  In any event, the weight which would
    fall to be given to such a relationship would normally be  limited,  in
    its own terms.





E.  THE APPELLANT'S CASE

28. We can now turn to the facts of the appellant's case.  The appellant is
    a citizen of Albania, born in 1999, who says  he  was  brought  to  the
    United Kingdom at the age of 7.  An asylum claim was made on his behalf
    in 2008 but, by September 2010, he had become appeal rights  exhausted.
    After a period without leave, the appellant was granted  limited  leave
    to remain in 2014, until 6 September 2016.  Although the matter is  not
    pellucid, it appears that the respondent has, thereafter,  treated  the
    appellant  as  someone  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  leave,   albeit
    statutorily extended.

29. In September 2016, the appellant received a  sentence  of  ten  months'
    detention and training for possession of a Class A drug with intent  to
    supply.  On 18 December 2017, he was convicted of conspiring to  supply
    Class A drugs and was sentenced to three  years'  imprisonment.   As  a
    consequence, on 6 July 2018, the respondent made a deportation order in
    respect of the appellant.  The appellant made  a  human  rights  claim,
    contending that his deportation would be contrary to Article 8  of  the
    ECHR.  That claim was refused by the respondent on 11 July 2018.

30. The appellant appealed against the refusal of his human  rights  claim.
    Following a hearing on 24 July 2019, the First-tier Tribunal  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.

31. The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard evidence  from  the  appellant  and
    from the appellant's cousin.  The Presenting  Officer  told  the  judge
    that  the  officer  had  no  cross-examination  of  any  of  the  other
    witnesses.  They were not called to give oral evidence.

32. One of those witness was B.  She is a  British  citizen,  born  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Her witness statement disclosed that she  became  good
    friends with the appellant around the beginning of  2016.   Later,  "we
    had stronger feelings for one another and our relationship  developed".
    In April 2017, B  described  herself  and  the  appellant  beginning  a
    "committed relationship, and we would  always  be  together,  going  on
    dates and meeting up".  Although  they  did  not  live  together,  they
    stayed at each other's homes.  In June 2017, the appellant bought her a
    promise ring "to confirm his feelings for me".

33. On 12 July 2017, the appellant was remanded in custody.   B  "struggled
    to cope". She visited him every week whilst he was on remand in Bristol
    and, later, Winchester.  After the appellant's  imprisonment  (which  B
    says was for four years), she again visited him every week.  She  would
    also write to him and they would try and speak on the telephone.

34. B said that she and the appellant had  discussed  their  future  plans,
    including living together, marriage and starting a family.   Describing
    the position after the appellant's release, B said:-

         "24. At the moment we live  with  our  respective  families,  as  I
             cannot afford to live separately  with  Pellumb  on  my  wages
             alone and therefore we have put our plans to live together  on
             hold until Pellumb's immigration status is resolved and he can
             get a job as well.

         25.  We have discussed our future at  great  lengths,  and  I  know
             Pellumb really wants to turn his life around.   Pellumb  wants
             to live an honest  life  without  any  trouble.   Pellumb  has
             spoken about pursing a career in plumbing and wants to be able
             to contribute positively to society.

         ...

         33.  Pellumb and I  are  excited  about  our  future  together  and
             although we are still young, I want him to be the father of my
             children.  I know that he will be a brilliant dad and would be
             conscious about teaching them right from wrong.

         ...

         35.  I love Pellumb  and  cannot  imagine  being  apart  from  him.
             However, I would not be able to relocate to Albania  with  him
             as my life is here in the UK and its all I  have  ever  known.
             Also, my mum is extremely unwell and is wheelchair  bound.   I
             help my dad in looking after her and  would  not  be  able  to
             leave them.

         ..."

35.   At  paragraph  25  of  his  decision,  the  judge  noted  Mr  Malik's
    submissions regarding B.  Mr  Malik  said  that  B  was  a  "qualifying
    partner" within the meaning of section 117D of the 2002  Act  and  that
    the effect on her of the deportation of the appellant would  be  unduly
    harsh.  Mr Malik  said  that  there  was  no  basis  for  treating  the
    definition of "qualifying partner" under the 2002  Act  as  having  the
    same definition as that set out in section  GEN  of  Appendix  FM.   Mr
    Malik submitted that account needed to be taken of the  fact  that  B's
    mother was not well and required her care and support.  The  assessment
    needed to be made "independently of the gravity of  his  offending  and
    independently of s.117C(6) of the 2002 Act".

36. Beginning at paragraph 32, the First-tier Tribunal Judge  analysed  the
    relationship of the appellant and B.  He  noted  that  they  saw  their
    future together in the United Kingdom  and  hoped  to  have  a  family.
    However, they had not set up home together.  The judge also noted  that
    it was not long after the appellant had committed  his  drugs  offences
    that he had given B a promise ring.  The appellant had made no  mention
    of this ring.  Although the judge  was  satisfied  that  this  was  "an
    indication of commitment ...  it  does  not  amount  to  an  engagement
    between young people which includes  in  conventional  understanding  a
    promise to marry, particularly when they are not living together".

37. At paragraph 33,  the  judge  found  that  the  appellant  and  B  "are
    committed to some degree to each other but that  such  commitment  does
    not,  and  perhaps  rightly  so  in  view  of  the  history  of   their
    relationship and the amount of time during it when  the  appellant  had
    been detained, make [B] the fiancï¿½e of the appellant".

38. The judge then turned to the meaning of "partner".   He  observed  that
    there was no definition of the term in the 2002 Act.  The  judge  found
    that if B "were the appellant's qualifying partner, then having  regard
    to her personal circumstances it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  her  to
    pursue her life in Albania".  However, at paragraph 35, the judge  held
    that, in the light of what he had earlier said, he did not find B was a
    partner of the appellant "for the purposes of s.177D or Appendix FM".

39.  The  judge  next  considered  whether  there  were   very   compelling
    circumstances, in terms of section 117C(6).  The judge rejected five of
    the six such circumstances, including the matter  of  a  claimed  blood
    feud in Albania.  No complaint is made about the judge's  rejection  of
    these circumstances.

40. The final circumstance concerned the relationship between the appellant
    and B.  At paragraph 43, the judge found:-

         "43. I accept [B's] claim that she will  be  devastated  if  he  is
             deported  to  Albania.   The  relationship  is  still   in   a
             comparatively early stage and it is  generally  accepted  that
             time will heal most broken hearts.  I have  sympathy  for  her
             and her prospective grief and unhappiness if her  relationship
             with the Appellant is broken by his deportation.

         44.  I have considered the jurisprudence in  MS  (s.117C(6):  "very
             compelling circumstances") Philippines [2019] UKUT 00122 (IAC)
             and have taken  into  account  the  positive  aspects  of  the
             Appellant's case to which I have referred  in  the  course  of
             this decision  including  his  comparative  youth,  length  of
             absence from Albania, integration with his cousin's family and
             relationship with and the prospective hardship which  will  be
             imposed on [B] if the  Appellant  is  deported.   I  have  had
             regard to the remarks of the Crown Court sentencing  judge  at
             page J2 of the SSHD's bundle about the impact  on  society  at
             large of those involved in the supply of illegal drugs and the
             public interest in the deportation of  foreign  criminals.   I
             have come to the conclusion for the reasons already given that
             the public interest in the deportation of  the  Appellant  for
             the legitimate public objective of the prevention of  disorder
             or crime is not outweighed by the circumstances and  those  of
             his  immediate  circle   when   considered   in   the   round.
             Consequently, the appeal is dismissed."

41. The first issue is whether the First-tier Tribunal Judge did, in  fact,
    apply the definition of "partner" in GEN.1.2. so as to exclude  B  from
    the scope of section 117C(5).  It is possible that, in saying  what  he
    did at paragraph 35 about paragraphs 32 and 33, the judge  was  looking
    at the substance of the  relationship  between  the  appellant  and  B,
    before deciding that the relationship did not make  B  the  appellant's
    partner.  In referring at paragraph 33 to B not being  the  fiancï¿½e  of
    the appellant, the judge might have been doing no more than to  examine
    the relationship by reference to the definition in GEN.1.2, in the  way
    that  we  have  described  above;  that  is  to  say,  to  see  if  the
    relationship fell within the definition but not to regard a failure  to
    do so as determinative  of  whether  B  was  the  appellant's  partner.
    Overall, however, it seems to us that, by concentrating  on  whether  B
    was the appellant's fiancï¿½e, the judge did, in  fact,  fall  into  that
    trap. He treated the definition in GEN 1.2 as determinative.

42. Adopting the broad evaluative approach which we have described earlier,
    we  find  the  evidence  disclosed,  albeit  by  a  narrow  margin,   a
    relationship of sufficient commitment as  to  make  B  the  appellant's
    partner for the purposes of Part 5A.  B had exhibited such a commitment
    to the appellant in standing by him, both whilst he was on  remand  and
    also during his imprisonment, following conviction.  They had begun  to
    discuss a future life together.

43. Although the judge said he would have found it unduly harsh for B to go
    with the appellant to Albania, the judge failed to say whether he would
    have found it unduly harsh for B to remain in the  United  Kingdom,  in
    the event of the appellant's deportation. It is,  however,  plain  from
    the judge's  decision  that  he  would  undoubtedly  have  reached  the
    conclusion that such a scenario would not be unduly harsh on B.  As the
    judge observed, the relationship was "still in  a  comparatively  early
    stage".   Whilst  it  would  be  unpleasant  for  B,   as   the   judge
    acknowledged, there was no indication that her  grief  would  be  long-
    lasting or so severe as to affect her health.

44. Any error that the judge may have committed in terms  of  having  undue
    regard to the definition in GEN.1.2. is, accordingly, immaterial.   The
    judge was entitled to his findings regarding the  actual  substance  of
    the relationship. On the basis of those findings, the appellant's  case
    failed, whether B is regarded  as  his  partner,  or  not.  Mr  Malik's
    submission that there  is  always  a  different,  higher  threshold  to
    overcome under section 117C(6), compared with section 117C(5),  is  not
    right, for the reasons we have given at paragraphs 24 to 26 above.

45. B has made a new witness statement.  Mr  Malik  rightly  conceded  that
    this could not affect the question of whether the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge erred in law.  Mr Malik also informed us, on instruction, that  B
    says she is now pregnant with the appellant's child.   That  also  does
    not affect the findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, based on  the
    evidence as it was before him.  It will be for the appellant to  decide
    whether to make representations to  the  respondent,  by  reference  to
    these developments.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain error  on  a  point
of law, such as to require that decision to be set  aside.   The  appeal  is
accordingly dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
