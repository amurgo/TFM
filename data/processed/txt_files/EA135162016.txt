                                   Between

                                 PETER MARK
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr L Kennedy, Advocate, instructed by SLA,
Solicitors, London
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This determination is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision dated 4 November 2016, declining to issue
         a residence card under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge Blair, promulgated on 13 March 2018.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal dated 28 March 2018.

      v) The grant of permission by FtT Judge Scott  Baker,  dated  22  June
         2018.

     vi) Counsel's  skeletal  argument,  or  outline  submissions,  dated  6
         December 2018.

 2. The appellant's position was this:

      The first issue for the FtT was not whether parties  had  been  living
      together  as  husband  and  wife,  because  cohabitation  is   not   a
      requirement for persons to be considered as  spouses  under  community
      law - written argument at [4].

      The relevant questions were only:

           (i) whether the appellant demonstrated residence  in  accordance
           with the regulations for a continuous 5-year period;

           (ii) whether the appellant's wife was exercising  treaty  rights
           when the divorce proceedings were initiated; and

           (iii) whether the appellant  was  employed,  self-sufficient  or
           self-employed following dissolution of the marriage.

      There had been sufficient evidence for the appellant to succeed on all
      those points.

      The case should be remitted to the FtT for fresh  decision,  based  on
      the correct approach.

 3. Mr Govan conceded that the FtT had taken an incorrect  legal  approach.
    However, he said that the judge properly considered  all  the  evidence
    and plainly found that  the  marriage  was  never  genuine,  which  was
    sufficient to preserve the decision, notwithstanding the error.

 4. I reserved my decision.

 5. A party is not often entitled to  have  a  decision  set  aside,  after
    presenting his case on exactly the basis later said to be  an  error  -
    see the decision at [4], [8] and  [9].   Appeals  should  generally  be
    about error made on the case put to the FtT, not  about  afterthoughts.
    The appellant had qualified representation prior  to  and  at  the  FtT
    hearing.  (The error is not of Mr Kennedy or of those instructing  him.
    The appellant subsequently changed representatives.)

 6. However, I also note that the error is equally due to  the  respondent,
    and if the decision turned on applying the incorrect legal approach,  I
    consider that it would fall to be set aside.

 7. In support of the proposition that the appellant might  have  succeeded
    on the evidence, but for the distraction of asking the wrong  question,
    Mr Kennedy said that prior cohabitation could  reasonably  be  inferred
    from  the  terms  of  the  Hungarian  divorce   decree,   a   "previous
    adjudication of an EEA/EU specialist family court" which was  "suitably
    authoritative".  He suggested that the judge was wrong to  regard  this
    as consistent with parties having been married in form only.

 8. I was not referred directly to  the  terms  of  the  decree,  which  is
    translated at pages 20 - 21 of the appellant's bundle.  I  do  not  see
    anything in it which takes it above the value ascribed by the FtT.

 9. The decree is based on the assertions of the appellant's former wife in
    unopposed divorce proceedings.  The court did  not  adjudicate  on  any
    dispute between the  parties  on  whether  they  had  cohabited  or  on
    anything else.  The appellant's argument goes too far  in  saying  that
    the decree establishes there had been cohabitation, and that the wife's
    specification of a UK address implied  that  she  had  been  exercising
    treaty rights in the UK.  Nor do I see that the length of the marriage,
    7 ï¿½ years, "militates against it  being  a  marriage  of  convenience".
    There is no logical link there.

10. The next part of the argument I find far-fetched.  It is said that  had
    this been a marriage of convenience, the wife would have  founded  upon
    "this more compelling ground".  Whether entering  into  a  marriage  of
    convenience is a ground for dissolution in Hungarian  law  is  unknown,
    and could be established only by evidence of that law.  Even if it is a
    good ground, it is far from obvious that the wife would have found that
    a more attractive route than a simple unopposed  divorce.   It  appears
    rather more likely that parties would be  reluctant  to  admit  that  a
    marriage was for convenience only.  To do so would negate the appellant
    gaining any right of residence from the marriage.

11. The FtT reasoned its findings as follows:

      [13] Divorce certificate consistent with having been married, "in form
      at least", and with  appellant's  claim  that  his  wife  returned  to
      Hungary, where the divorce took place.

      [14] Two letters of  support,  but  very  brief  and  lacking  detail,
      authors not available for cross-examination.

      [15] "Of real concern", unreconciled inconsistency  whether  appellant
      established contact with his wife directly or through a friend.

      [16] Implausible, even after passage of time, that only a  water  bill
      could be produced from the Birmingham property  where  the  appellant,
      his wife and two others were said to have resided.

      [17] Water bill for the period shortly before the  claimed  split  up,
      surprising if they lived there 2011 - 2013 that no more available, and
      no explanation for possession even of this limited item.

      [18] Nothing to connect appellant with woman  in  photographs  as  his
      wife.

      [19] Nothing to connect signatories of supporting letters with persons
      in photographs.

      [20] No copy lease  for  property  in  Birmingham;  no  evidence  from
      landlord.

      [21] Not satisfied  appellant  and  sponsor  lived  together  in  this
      country for at least one year.

      [22] - [23] Nothing from appellant to demonstrate how he and his  wife
      came to know each other, what brought them together, or interests they
      shared;  pointers  to  relationship  of  form   only;   marriage   and
      relationship not genuine.

12. No error has been suggested in the judge's reasons, other than that  he
    should have taken much more from the divorce decree in the  appellant's
    favour than he did.  I  have  not  found  that  part  of  the  argument
    persuasive.  The adverse factual findings are strong, and not  affected
    by error.  On those findings, the appellant did not satisfy  the  terms
    of the regulations.  Accordingly, it has not been  shown  that  if  the
    judge had been directed to the correct legal  approach,  there  is  any
    chance that the outcome would have been different.

13. The error into which the FtT was led was not such  as  to  require  its
    decision to be set aside, so it shall stand.

14. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
