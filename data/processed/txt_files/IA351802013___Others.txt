Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms  N  Atreya,  Counsel  (instructed  by  Allied  Law
                    Chambers and Ashfords LLP)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the sake of convenience I shall refer to  the  appellant  as  "the
      secretary of state" and the respondents as "the claimants."


   2. The claimants are nationals of Pakistan, born on 15th  December  1985,
      26th March 1983 and 10th January  1984  respectively.  The  first  and
      second claimants were the entrepreneur  team.  The  second  and  third
      claimants are husband and wife.


   3. Their appeals against the decisions of the respondent  dated  the  8th
      August 2013 refusing their applications for leave to remain in the  UK
      as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants and dependants and  to  remove  them
      from the UK were allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge W L Grant  in  a
      determination promulgated on 14th August 2014.


   4. He noted that the second and third claimants have a daughter, who  was
      born on 22nd October 2012 and who is also a  Pakistani  national.  Her
      claim for leave to remain as a child of a Tier 1 Migrant was similarly
      refused on 8th August 2013.


   5. The secretary of state was not satisfied that the  claimants  met  the
      funding requirements under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.


   6. Judge Grant noted that it was not in issue that the first  and  second
      claimants (the entrepreneur team) failed to meet the requirements  set
      out at paragraph 41-SD as the bank statements they provided with their
      applications showed that the first claimant held in excess of  �28,000
      in his account in his sole name and  that  the  second  claimant  held
      almost �28,000 in his account in his sole name.


   7. They each provided  a  bank  letter  confirming  the  state  of  their
      respective accounts but the failure  lay  in  the  fact  that  neither
      letter confirmed that they each had access to one another's funds [8].




   8. At paragraph 10  of  his  determination,  the  Judge  noted  that  the
      claimants failed in respect of  the  specified  evidence  requirements
      requiring evidence of cross access  to  funds.  He  stated  that  'the
      notes' required an equal level of  control  over  funds  or  over  the
      business in question, which they could show at the date of application
      [10].


   9. He also found that on 17th December 2012 (which post dated the date of
      decision) each claimant had transferred his funds to a  business  bank
      account at Barclays in the name of their company.  He  noted  that  it
      "might be argued" by the secretary of state that she  could  not  have
      known of this transaction "... but it can equally  be  argued  by  the
      [claimants] that they carried it out not as a result of  the  decision
      but pursuant to the declaration  dated  12th  December  2012  and  the
      covering letter from their solicitors "..... which  the  secretary  of
      state did see". That letter stated that  they  were  ready  to  invest
      their funds jointly into their business." [10]


  10. He found from the documents that the  business  is  a  "genuine  going
      concern." The claimants have shown an equal level of control over  the
      funds, ".....and that the evidence in support pre-dates the decision."




  11. He had also been asked in the alternative to find that the failure  to
      comply amounted to "wrong format" under paragraph 245AA of the rules.


  12. He set out the contents of paragraph 245AA and stated that  he  had  a
      choice, either to allow the appeal outright or  to  allow  it  to  the
      extent that it is referred back to the secretary of state to decide on
      the basis of the evidence which was not submitted to her  even  though
      it post-dated the application by a mere five days. He stated  that  in
      view of the fact that he had  found  that  the  company  was  a  going
      concern, he intended to allow the appeals "outright."


  13. He accordingly allowed the appeal of all  three  claimants  under  the
      rules [14-15].


  14. On 1st September 2014, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Page  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to appeal.


  15. Mr Walker referred to the fact that the Judge had stated at  paragraph
      9 that he had been referred to "notes" by counsel (not Ms  Atreya  but
      other counsel) who represented the claimants before the  hearing.  The
      Judge "extracted paragraph 52" from the notes apparently  relating  to
      entrepreneurial teams. It differed in its wording  from  the  relevant
      guidance applicable at the time. The guidance at the time was set  out
      in the secretary's grounds of appeal.


  16. Paragraph 52 stated that "two applicants may claim points for the same
      investment and business activity in tables 4, 5 or 6  providing  (sic)
      the following requirements are met. Those requirements  are  that  the
      applicants have an equal level of control over the  funds  and/or  the
      business or businesses in question, and that the applicants  are  both
      shown by name in  each  other's  applications  and  in  the  specified
      evidence required in the relevant table."


  17. It was thus submitted that the extract at paragraph  9  "plainly  post
      dates" the secretary of state's decision dated  8th  August  2013  and
      differs in wording from the relevant guidance applicable at the time.


  18. It was accepted that the relevant guidance, at A40, is in essence  the
      same as that referred to in paragraph 9 of the determination. This  is
      the policy guidance version applicable as at July 2013.


  19. He submitted that in any event, even though  the  Judge  relied  on  a
      later, and therefore not relevant document, the guidance extract (A40)
      makes it plain that  both  parties  must  be  named  in  each  other's
      application and in the evidence of funds.


  20. He referred  to  the  concession  of  counsel  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, set out at  paragraph  8  of  the  determination,  that  the
      claimants'  financial  evidence  had  not  met  the  requirements   of
      paragraph 41-SD of the rules.


  21. It accordingly appeared that the Judge concluded that the 'declaration
      of intent to invest' dated  the  12th  December  2012  was  enough  to
      satisfy the rules. He accordingly went on to allow the  appeals  under
      the rules. Mr Walker contended that this was  'unlawful',  given  that
      the claimants themselves accepted that they had not met the rules.


  22. Mr Walker further submitted that the document  allegedly  showing  the
      transfer of funds to the company, Lincoln Education  Ltd  (dated  17th
      December 2012) had not been provided to the secretary of state  before
      the decision was made, as noted by the Judge at paragraph  13  of  the
      determination, and was thus not admissible by virtue of s.85A  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


  23. Accordingly, he submitted that the Judge materially erred  in  placing
      reliance upon such a document "seemingly expecting  the  secretary  of
      state to guess that the transfer had been made."


  24. Mr Walker also referred to paragraph 13 of the determination where the
      Judge weighed up whether the matter should be  referred  back  to  the
      secretary of state to decide on the basis of the evidence  "which  was
      not submitted to her even though it post dated the  application  by  a
      mere five days." That plainly showed that the evidence  had  not  been
      available as at  the  date  of  application,  in  contravention  of  a
      specific requirement under the rule.


  25. On behalf of the claimants, Ms Atreya submitted that the determination
      was lawful and in accordance with the substantive requirements.


  26. She submitted that the Judge correctly referred to paragraph 52 of the
      entrepreneurial team's notes which existed at the  date  of  decision.
      She produced the archived immigration rules from the UKBA  website  in
      August 2013 under the heading of  Appendix  A  Attributes,  where  the
      relevant paragraph (52) is correctly set out.


  27. Ms  Atreya  accepted  that  the  relevant  immigration  rules  are  at
      paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A. The financial evidence submitted by the
      former representatives was in the form of two  bank  statements  which
      did not name both members of the team. The Judge found that  they  had
      an equal level of control of funds as at the date of application based
      on the bank statement declaration at A28 and paragraph 52 of  Appendix
      A. The Judge found that the document  dated  17th  December  2012  was
      evidence of their declaration at A24 made on 12th December 2012.


  28. Accordingly, she submitted that the claimants  met  the  "substantial"
      requirements of the rules as at the date of decision. They were  named
      in each other's applications. They submitted bank statements  in  each
      of their names and a declaration to confirm that they would have legal
      control of �50,000.


  29. Ms Atreya also sought to rely in the alternative on unfairness in  the
      interview process. The interview records of their interviews  on  17th
      June 2013 were not disclosed. She submitted that the  interview  'must
      have been concerned' with issues relating to access to �50,000  and/or
      the nature of the business being invested in.


  30. She submitted that there has been unfairness caused  to  them  and  in
      particular the failure of the secretary of state to indicate that  she
      was prepared to accept further evidence after application  and  before
      the decision as she had done in other cases.


  31. Had  the  claimants  known  this  they  could  have  instructed  their
      respective banks to  add  to  their  financial  statements  that  both
      members had access to money in two different bank  accounts  totalling
      �50,000, which  was  presented  to  the  secretary  of  state  as  two
      individual bank statements without both names of  the  teams  on  both
      statements.


  32. Mr Walker submitted in reply that this contention has never  been  the
      subject of an application for permission to "counter  appeal"  against
      the decision of the secretary of state.


  33. Ms Atreya also submitted that Article 8 (Private Life)  had  not  been
      considered in the refusal decision. It had been raised in the  grounds
      of appeal and referred to in witness statements.  She  submitted  that
      there are good reasons why the claim should succeed under Article 8.


  34. Following Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC), the claimants and  dependants
      have entered and remained in the UK lawfully at all times.  They  have
      studied and worked here. They have  never  been  a  burden  on  public
      funds. They are contributors to  the  economy.  They  both  have  good
      character and no criminal convictions. There is  evidence  of  genuine
      business activity. They are "genuine individuals"  who  have  complied
      with the requirements of immigration control at all times.


  35. Mr Walker submitted with regard to this submission that there had been
      no application for permission by way of any counter appeal.


Assessment


  36. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the claimants failed to meet the
      requirements of paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A of the rules.  Paragraph
      41 of Appendix A provides that an applicant will only be considered to
      have access to funds if the specified documents in paragraph 41-SD are
      provided, to show cash money  to  the  amount  required.  Furthermore,
      paragraph 41-SD identifies the specified  documents  in  Table  4  and
      paragraph 41. Neither of the proposed team members produced  a  letter
      confirming that they each had access to one another's funds.


  37. The Judge noted that they had  failed  in  respect  of  the  specified
      evidence requirement.


  38. To qualify for leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
      under paragraph 245DD of  the  rules,  an  applicant  "must  meet  the
      requirements listed below." One of those requirements is that he  must
      have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix A.


  39. The claimants were unable to meet that requirement.


  40. Their applications were made on 12th December 2012. Five  days  later,
      each transferred his funds to a business bank account at  Barclays  in
      the name of the company. This constituted post decision evidence which
      had not been provided to the secretary  of  state  before  making  the
      decision. Accordingly, it was not admissible by virtue of s.85A of the
      2002 Act.


  41. The Judge stated at  paragraph  10  that  it  can  be  argued  by  the
      claimants that they carried out this transaction not as  a  result  of
      the decision but pursuant to their  declaration  dated  12th  December
      2012 and the covering letter from their solicitors which the secretary
      of state saw. That letter stated that they were ready to invest  their
      funds jointly into their business.


  42. However, that was simply a declaration of a  possible  future  intent.
      The fact remains that they had not provided proper evidence that  each
      had access to one another's funds.


  43. Before the First-tier Tribunal, it was contended at paragraph 2 of the
      skeleton  argument  produced,  that  the  claimants  had  provided   a
      declaration with the application. The bank letter supplied  "had  only
      missing the information of 'having access to each  other's  accounts',
      which duly comes under the cover of 'wrong format.'" It was  therefore
      contended that the  secretary  of  state  'violated'  the  flexibility
      policy in such matters.


  44. I have had regard to paragraph 245AA. I find that it  is  inapplicable
      in the circumstances.  The  secretary  of  state  will  only  consider
      documents submitted after the application is made where the  applicant
      has submitted specified documents in the first place. If he  has,  the
      secretary of state may contact him and request the correct  documents.
      An example of such document is that it is in the wrong format.


  45. However, the required specified  documents  had  not  been  submitted.
      Accordingly, paragraph 245AA did not operate to the advantage  of  the
      claimants in these circumstances. In any event, this was clearly not a
      case in which the document was simply "in the wrong format".  Nor  did
      it fall under any of the other sub-paragraphs of paragraph 245AA(b).


  46. I have had regard to  the  skeleton  argument  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal. There was no submission with regard to Article 8.  The  only
      reference to Article 8 was in the witness statement of  Mr  Kamran  at
      paragraph 6, where he "invited" the Tribunal to assess the  matter  on
      Article 8 grounds.


  47. However, he  did  not  rely  on  any  additional  factors  apart  from
      asserting that he is under stress as a result of  the  decision;  that
      his immigration status is at stake; that "the whole  savings  is  also
      involved therein;" and that it has severe implications on his  private
      life in the UK. However, there is no detail provided nor any  evidence
      produced relating to the alleged severe implications. In the  case  of
      Mr Shazad Ali, he has provided the same assertions at paragraph  6  of
      his witness statement.


  48. The claimants were represented at the hearing. There is no  indication
      that these submissions were made  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      regarding Article 8. The grounds  of  appeal  at  paragraph  7  simply
      placed reliance on Article 8 as creating positive obligations.


  49. However, even if it is accepted that the Judge  erred  in  failing  to
      consider an Article 8 claim, I find that the error was not material in
      the circumstances. In Patel and Others v Secretary of  State  for  the
      Home Department [2013] UKSC 72, the Court  focused  attention  on  the
      nature and purpose of Article 8  and  in  particular,  recognised  the
      limited utility of that article in private life cases where  they  are
      far removed from the protection of  individual's  moral  and  physical
      integrity.


  50. Nor are the claimants' human rights enhanced by their  not  committing
      criminal offences  or  by  not  relying  on  public  funds.  The  only
      significance is that in cases concerning their proposed  removal  from
      the UK, this precludes the secretary of state  from  pointing  to  any
      public  interest  justifying  removal,  over  and  above   the   basic
      importance of maintaining a firm and coherent  system  of  immigration
      control.


  51. There was accordingly no realistic prospect  of  their  appeals  being
      upheld under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.


  52. I accordingly find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      involved the making of an error on a point of law. I  accordingly  set
      aside that decision.


  53. In re-making it, I find that the claimants have  failed  to  meet  the
      requirements set out at  paragraph  41-SD  and  were  accordingly  not
      entitled to be awarded 75 points under Appendix A. They did  not  show
      as at the date of application or decision that they had an equal level
      of control over the funds and/or the business in question.


  54. The submission of evidence  after  the  date  of  decision  that  each
      appellant transferred his funds to a business bank account at Barclays
      in the name of their company, constituted inadmissible evidence  under
      the 2002 Act.


  55. I also find that for the reasons given, the claimants have  not  shown
      that they are entitled to any benefit  from  paragraph  245AA  of  the
      Immigration Rules.


  56. Finally, for the reasons already given, I find that  the  decision  of
      the  respondent  with  regard   to   their   removal   constituted   a
      proportionate interference with their Article 8(private life) claims.


Decisions


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error on a point of law.


      Having set aside the decision, I re-make it and substitute a  decision
      dismissing the claimants' appeals.


     No anonymity order made.
