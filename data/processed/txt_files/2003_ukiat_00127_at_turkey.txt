                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Miss C Hanrahan for the Secretary of State
Miss C Ganning (Halliday Reeves, solicitors, Gateshead) for the claimant

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator (Mr T Jones, and  not
   the adjudicator suggested by the careless person - neither Miss  Hanrahan
   nor the presenting officer before the  adjudicator  -  who  drew  up  the
   grounds of appeal), sitting at Durham on 18 July 2002, allowing an asylum
   and human rights appeal by a Kurdish citizen of Turkey. Leave  was  given
   on the basis of what were said to be muddled and  contradictory  findings
   in the decision.

2. Halfway through the hearing before us, Miss Ganning raised  the  question
   of whether leave should ever have been given at all, on  the  basis  that
   the decision had been improperly re-issued, so that it  was  far  out  of
   time from the original date. In our view:

   a) we have no power to review a grant of  leave,  once  made  (see  Kumar
      [2002] UKIAT 06451): the challenge must at present be made on judicial
      review (or under the new statutory review procedure, when  that  comes
      into force); and even if we did

   b) it is far too late to make  such  a  challenge  when  the  hearing  is
      halfway through: best practice would be to make  it  as  soon  as  the
      grant of leave is notified (27 March in this case); but  allowing  the
      hearing to proceed on the merits of the case is a clear waiver of  any
      such point as this.

3. The  adjudicator  summarizes  the  claimant's  case  reasonably  clearly,
   though we rather wish he would do something to  supplement  his  typist's
   apparent complete ignorance of punctuation. The trouble  comes  with  his
   findings, which come at �� 14-18, and are reproduced below.  On  a  minor
   point, we should mention that the excessive length of � 14 (a whole page)
   removes much of the point of numbered paragraphs. Occasionally  that  may
   be unavoidable; but there is no apparent reason for it here:  again  that
   is something for the adjudicator to think about  when  proof-reading,  if
   not before.

4. This is what the adjudicator found:

   14. The Respondent's case is set out in the Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter
   and the noted closing remarks of the Presenting Officer in the Record  of
   Proceedings. I shall not repeat them at  length  here  for  the  sake  of
   brevity and obviously would record that the documents  are  there  to  be
   read in  themselves  and  the  Record  of  Proceedings.  In  summary  the
   Respondent's case is that the Appellant has given conflicting accounts in
   what is becoming an increasingly embroidered and evolving  claim.  Little
   information was given on the asylum  interview  record  arrival  on  22nd
   April as regards his political background.  Three  of  the  questions  on
   pages C4, 7 and 9 offered the Appellant the opportunity to comment but he
   does not do so. The Respondent takes issue also with the Appellant's  use
   of Dev Sol which has not existed now for some  years  but  has  continued
   under other identity. The Appellant who the Respondent contends has  been
   clear and fluid in giving his evidence today. I have to say I  have  made
   similar note for myself in the Record of Proceedings at the conclusion of
   the Appellant's evidence has given varying accounts of even the  core  of
   his story, the bus destruction and detention. The Respondent  points  out
   that in relation to why he had to report the burning of the  bus  to  the
   military rather than the police the Respondent points out: (a) At  02  of
   the bundle he does not know why. This was noted in  representations  made
   by his first solicitors of 17th May 2000. (b) In  his  current  statement
   given to his present  solicitors  the  Respondent  points  out  that  the
   Appellant says he needed to complain to the military as it was  they  who
   he suspected of having burnt the bus.  (c)  In  his  evidence  today  the
   Appellant gives an account that he was told by the police  station  staff
   that the area in which the bus was burnt out was not  within  the  police
   station's area it was within the military's and  as  the  military  being
   responsible for that area he should report it to them. Further it has  to
   be said that there is an account given by the Appellant at (02)  that  he
   was beaten up at the police station before being sent on to the  military
   that allegation is not repeated in  his  later  detailed  statement.  The
   Respondent contends that the account given on  arrival  where  pro  forma
   questions have been followed and have enquired the Appellant's health and
   condition and ability to respond is a true and accurate  account  of  the
   Appellant's case. Whilst there is medical  evidence  in  respect  of  the
   Appellant the Respondent contends is  this  sufficient  in  condition  to
   result in such a degree of seeming loss of  memory,  confusion  etc.  The
   Appellant in his evidence went on further the Respondent  points  out  to
   excuse these lapses or explain the pressure at the  asylum  interview  to
   saying that an agent had given him a pill to take before getting  on  the
   plane and leaving for Heathrow to calm him which had  then  drugged  him.
   The Respondent quite rightly points out  that  that  is  the  first  that
   anyone seemingly in the proceedings has heard  of  that.  The  Respondent
   whilst not expecting the Appellant to have fled with any  documents  that
   may have supported his cause has had two years  to  bring  forward  other
   evidence that might support him. As  such  the  Respondent  summates  the
   matter as to the core of the case being established in  relation  to  the
   bus incident and subsequent persecution then it is really  a  matter  for
   the Adjudicator looking at that the Respondent's view being that he  will
   have little  to  go  on  other  than  this  man's  word.  The  Respondent
   representative concludes by pointing out that the Appellant was  able  to
   leave an international airport in Turkey using his own documentation on a
   commercial flight notwithstanding his fears of being  wanted  or  of  the
   computer efficiency of the authorities. That he had been able to live for
   some time in Istanbul before leaving without being traced and  points  to
   objective material suggesting that if he were returned now  as  a  failed
   asylum seeker even after this passage of time he would  not  be  at  risk
   whereby his protected rights would be breached.

   15. Essentially the advocates are putting before me  that  in  this  case
   credibility is the key issue. Thereafter deemed credible or otherwise the
   question of risk on return then also  comes  into  play.  In  looking  at
   credibility my attention has been drawn rightly to the  UNHCR  Guidelines
   and the case of  Chiver  (10758).  I  note  from  those  guidelines  that
   consideration must be given to the condition of those  arriving  in  this
   country on arrival taking into account the nature of their journey,  past
   experiences and treatment by the authorities in their  home  country  and
   facing the authorities in this for the first time. I also note that it is
   perfectly possible for an Adjudicator to consider that  an  Appellant  is
   not telling the truth about certain matters is mistaken about others  and
   has even embellished his case yet  the  core  of  that  case  can  remain
   standing. I am grateful to the  parties  for  bringing  to  my  attention
   objective material that is referred to their submissions and  the  Record
   of Proceedings. It is clear that there are still well-founded concerns as
   to the human rights record in Turkey. In respect of the medical  evidence
   I have to note that I am not medically qualified and that as yet  and  as
   present no diagnosis of cerebral  involvement  of  Behcet's  syndrome  is
   known in connection with the Appellant. Clearly in the  absence  of  such
   diagnosis of clinicians I am not in a  position  to  give  any  differing
   opinion but can only deal with it on the basis that it is indeed a factor
   which has to be keyed in at this stage given the low burden and  standard
   of proof herein. There is clearly a diagnosis of Behcet's itself.

   16. The Appellant has on observation before me given evidence fluidly and
   clearly. I note that I must take extreme care in looking at this  bearing
   in mind the use of an interpreter and my own want of experience of having
   day to day conversations with persons from this country.  The  Respondent
   has quite  rightly  pointed  out  to  a  number  of  differences  in  the
   Appellant's account but has not gone  on  to  challenge  the  Appellant's
   assertions that subsequent to his departure documents had been found that
   incriminated him, the authorities continue to look for him and harass his
   parents. The core of the Appellant's case was supported in  some  measure
   by accounts of treatment undergone by others as noted  in  the  objective
   evidence.

   17. I note from the UNHCR Guidelines giving consideration to the  initial
   interview which I accept is a pro forma  interview  rather  than  a  free
   flowing asylum interview record but it may have been possible that it had
   the appearance of being curtailed but I do not consider it to  have  been
   unfair. The Appellant has then sought to give some further detail and has
   referred through his solicitors in their letter of 17th May 2000 that  he
   was told that he could give further information and this he sought to do.
   He has given further and  fuller  information  subsequently  in  a  fully
   prepared statement. In all of these statements the core of his  case  the
   incident relating to the bus,  the   subsequent  treatment  has  remained
   largely the same with the exception of detail as to perhaps why he  would
   have gone to the  military  who  had  ill-treated  him  earlier  and  the
   omission as regards  a  beating  at  the  police  station  preceding  his
   referral to the military to make his  complaint.  In  essence  I  do  not
   consider these to be such that the Appellant's credibility in relation to
   this incident, his family  history  of  involvement  with  the  political
   parties and ongoing interest in him to be  such  that  I  could  make  an
   adverse credibility finding.  I  am  further  satisfied  that  given  the
   interest in him notwithstanding his ability to leave by air earlier  that
   he would not be of interest if he were returned. Looking at the objective
   material and looking at the matters in the round it  is  clear  that  the
   Appellant would be at sufficient risk to consider that his  rights  under
   Article 3 would be prejudiced. I am not satisfied under  Article  2  that
   there is a sufficient  or  near  certainty  of  death  on  the  objective
   information or the information from the Appellant.

   18. Having reached these conclusions I do find that it would be a  breach
   of the United Kingdom's obligations under the  1951  Convention;  because
   its actual or imputed opinion, and under Article 3 of the 1950 Convention
   were he and his family to be returned to his home country at this time.

4. Miss Ganning conceded at once what we may perhaps most politely call  the
   infelicities and obscurities of those paragraphs; but she said that, read
   as a whole, they showed  the  adjudicator  had  reached  a  decision  for
   reasons he was entitled to rely on. Some of the difficulties can be cured
   by supplying punctuation, and we need not spend time on those. One, taken
   up in the grounds of appeal at � 2.4, relates to this passage:

   I am further satisfied that given the interest in him notwithstanding his
   ability to leave by air earlier that he would not be of  interest  if  he
   were returned.

   Clearly the adjudicator meant "...  would  be  of  interest  if  he  were
   returned". We do hope he will start proof-reading his decisions,  because
   that is not the sort of correction we ought to have to make for him.

5. Turning to the more substantial points in the case, there is  a  complete
   failure by the adjudicator to refer to  any  details  of  the  background
   evidence before him. This, as it seems we  have  to  make  clear,  is  as
   unacceptable  when  allowing  an  appeal  as  when  dismissing  it.   The
   adjudicator did say this:

   8. I have also taken into account bundles of documents placed  before  me
   containing   material   evidence   and   objective   material   by   both
   representatives. I have been referred to and guided to  certain  passages
   and I have read those passages with special care,  I  read  them  in  the
   context  of  the  entire  document.  I  have  read  the  whole   of   the
   documentation set before me in order to help me come to my conclusions.

   We have to say that this kind of apparently standard paragraph  is  quite
   valueless. It does nothing at all  to  let  either  the  parties  or  the
   Tribunal know what the adjudicator actually thinks about  the  background
   material, which is the point of putting anything in a judicial decision.


6. The following passages at �� 15 - 17 take this no further:

   I am grateful to the parties  for  bringing  to  my  attention  objective
   material that  is  referred  to  their  submissions  and  the  Record  of
   Proceedings. It is clear that there are still well-founded concerns as to
   the human rights record in Turkey.

   The core of the  Appellant's  case  was  supported  in  some  measure  by
   accounts of treatment undergone by  others  as  noted  in  the  objective
   evidence.

   Looking at the objective material and looking at the matters in the round
   it is clear that the Appellant would be at sufficient  risk  to  consider
   that his rights under Article 3 would be prejudiced. I am  not  satisfied
   under Article 2 that there is a sufficient or near certainty of death  on
   the objective information or the information from the Appellant.

7. None of those passages tell us anything about the sources or contents  of
   the "objective material" relied on by the adjudicator. He was prepared to
   accept the claimant's history, self-contradictory though it was:  perhaps
   his decision might have stood up, if he had gone on  to  analyse  on  the
   basis of any detailed current background evidence why  that  should  have
   put him at risk on return to Turkey now. Miss Ganning suggested that  the
   decision could nevertheless  be  supported  on  the  basis  of  what  the
   adjudicator  found  had  happened  to   the   claimant's   parents.   The
   adjudicator's findings on that amount to this:

   The Respondent has quite rightly pointed out to a number  of  differences
   in the  Appellant's  account  but  has  not  gone  on  to  challenge  the
   Appellant's assertions that subsequent to  his  departure  documents  had
   been found that incriminated him, the authorities continue  to  look  for
   him and harass his parents.

8. We do not regard noting that evidence  has  not  been  challenged  as  an
   adequate reason for accepting it. Asylum and human rights appeals are not
   ordinary civil cases. There is a strong public interest involved, and  it
   is for the adjudicator to make up his own  mind  independently,  and  for
   adequate reasons, on every material point. The adjudicator did under � 13
   give the details of what was claimed on this one:

   (vii) He claims that this harassment continues.  He  is  aware  from  his
   parents that soldiers continue to look for him. He is aware that his home
   has been searched and he says illegal magazines proving  his  association
   with Dev Sol (which the Appellant  accepts  was  disbanded  in  1994  but
   continues to use 'the old name'). The authorities  being  aware  of  this
   together with his claimed background and the fact  that  other  relatives
   have been granted asylum status in Germany he believes with the  computer
   records kept by the State there is no safe place for him to live anywhere
   in Turkey.

9. Even assuming that the adjudicator was entitled to accept that  evidence,
   it clearly required some  analysis  of  the  background  material  before
   entitling him to go on to conclude that it would lead to any real risk on
   return  of  either  Convention  persecution  or  ill-treatment  for  this
   claimant. Miss Ganning invited  us,  if  a  further  hearing  had  to  be
   directed, as she clearly foresaw it might be, to invite Mr Jones  to  put
   right what had gone wrong. Since he heard this  case  nearly  ten  months
   ago,


we see no useful purpose in that. There is in our view no alternative  to  a
new hearing before a fresh adjudicator, for which purpose the file  will  be
sent to the regional adjudicator at North Shields.
