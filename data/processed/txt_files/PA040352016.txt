                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly.  This order  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.   Any
failure to comply with this order could  give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
proceedings.


 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    not to grant him international protection under the Refugee  Convention
    or humanitarian protection grounds, or leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on human rights grounds.

 2. Leave to  appeal  was  granted  on  the  basis  of  various  evidential
    challenges,  but  the  appellant  has  neither  appeared  nor  arranged
    representation for the hearing today.

 3. Without the opportunity to hear from the appellant in detail as to  the
    matters which he challenges I am not satisfied that there is any proper
    reason for me to interfere with the First-tier Tribunal's  findings  of
    fact or that there is any error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision. I dismiss the appeal and uphold the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point  of  law.   The  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal stands.
