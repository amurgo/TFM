                       (anonymity direction NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. In a decision promulgated on 14 July 2017 Judge of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal Saffer concluded that he had no jurisdiction to  entertain
        the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision  dated  7
        March 2016 to refuse his application  for  an  EEA  residence  card
        pursuant to the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
        2006. Judge Saffer's decision relied on the Upper Tribunal decision
        of Sala [2016] UKUT 0411. This  was  overturned  by  the  Court  of
        Appeal in Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2017]
        EWCA Civ 1755.


     2. In directions issued on 29 January 2018 Upper Tribunal  Judge  Pitt
        indicated that the Upper Tribunal was minded to find  an  error  of
        law, set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  and  remit
        the case to the First-tier Tribunal. If either of the  parties  was
        opposed to this course they were directed to inform the Tribunal in
        writing (giving reasons), not later than 7 days from the  date  the
        Directions were issued. Following that  period,  the  parties  were
        informed that the Upper Tribunal would issue its decision.


     3. The Upper Tribunal has not received any correspondence from  either
        party within the stipulated timeframe, although  it  notes  letters
        sent by the appellant's solicitors dated 21 November  2017  and  19
        January 2018 to similar effect to the Judge Pitt's  directions.  In
        the light of Khan v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
        [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, the First-tier Tribunal was wrong in  law  to
        conclude that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.


     4. The Upper Tribunal is consequently satisfied  that  the  First-tier
        Tribunal's decision is  marred  by  a  material  legal  error  (the
        unlawful view that it lacked jurisdiction).


Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision is vitiated by a  material  error  of  law.
The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  (de  novo)
hearing, before a judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Saffer.
