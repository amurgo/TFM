For the Appellant:     Mr P Skinner (counsel instructed by ATM Law
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms K Everett (Specialist Appeals Unit)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Ullah [E], a  citizen  of  Afghanistan  born  1
       January 1983, against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
       dismiss his appeal on 9 May 2018, itself brought against the  refusal
       of his asylum claim on 3 December 2017.


    2. The Appellant's  asylum  claim  was  essentially  that  he  was  from
       Baghlan, and begun working for a  security  agency,  the  Afghanistan
       Nawin Security Organisation (ANSO) in 2011.  His  role  had  involved
       escorting American supply convoys around Kabul and Kandahar. If there
       was some cause to fear attack he would focus on how to deal with  it.
       In 2013 the Taliban became aware of his  activities  through  one  of
       their members, a distant family member, [MN]. Following threats  made
       via his father by telephone and letter, the family's house on a  farm
       was burned down, and the farmer was beaten. The  Appellant's  brother
       was shot shortly thereafter.

    3. The Appellant fled Afghanistan for the UK, travelling via Iran (where
       he spent 18 months),  Turkey,  Greece,  Macedonia,  Serbia,  Hungary,
       Austria, Germany  and  France  (spending  10  months  in  the  Calais
       "jungle" camp), entering the country on 28 August 2016  clandestinely
       by lorry, and claiming asylum on  8  September  2016.  His  wife  and
       children had left Afghanistan for Pakistan.

    4. The claim was supported by an identity card an  undated  letter  from
       one [LQ], the head of the ANSO, stating the Appellant was a Commander
       there from  1  July  2011  until  31  December  2013.  The  Appellant
       explained that he had not carried these documents to the UK, although
       he had requested them from ANSO before departing Afghanistan; he  had
       requested that his cousin in Kabul send them onto him.

    5. The Secretary of State refused the Appellant's  claim  on  the  basis
       that it contained inconsistencies and implausibilities;  additionally
       he had failed to claim asylum in a safe third country.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal considered the Appellant's asylum  claim.  It
       found his account of ANSO activities  to  be  vague  and  lacking  in
       detail; he had said at the screening interview he  had  no  title  or
       rank, yet later described himself as "Commander"; it was not credible
       that a person  with  that  level  of  responsibility  could  give  no
       particulars of the work involved in convoy escort. At  one  point  in
       his interview he had stated there was no training  for  jobs  in  the
       security industry, but also referred  to  having  received  training,
       explaining this on the basis he had understood himself  to  be  being
       asked about military training specifically: however his answer at the
       substantive interview was clear.

    7. The Judge  concluded  that  there  was  an  organisation  called  the
       Afghanistan Navin Security Company, run by its CEO [LQ], but that the
       letter provided by the Appellant to corroborate  his  claim  to  have
       worked for such a firm was amateurish and of poor quality, its author
       had a differently spelt name and the letter came from the ANSO rather
       than the ANSC; furthermore, it was not credible that the  Appellant's
       cousin would have obtained and retained documents of this nature  for
       a very significant period, which would have been  essential  were  it
       true  that  he  had  been  able  to  provide  them  recently  at  the
       Appellant's request. Thus it was to be assumed  that  both  documents
       were  fabrications  designed  to  bolster  a  false   asylum   claim.
       Furthermore, the Appellant had failed to claim asylum in many safe EU
       countries including France where he had spent 10 months.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal noted that AS Afghanistan  required  that  it
       have  regard  to  the  particular  circumstances  of  an   individual
       applicant in the context of conditions in the  place  of  relocation,
       including  a  person's   age,   nature   and   quality   of   support
       network/connections with Kabul/Afghanistan, their physical and mental
       health, and their language,  education  and  vocational  skills  when
       determining whether a person falls within the  general  position  set
       out above. The Appellant would return as a lone adult male,  with  at
       least a cousin in Kabul by way of support network. He  spoke  Pashto,
       and had some employment skills having worked in  a  bakery  in  Iran.
       There was no credible evidence  of  significant  mental  or  physical
       health problems.

    9. Thus the First-tier Tribunal concluded that the  Appellant  faced  no
       real risk of persecution or serious harm in Afghanistan, and  in  any
       event life in Kabul would be reasonable for him.

   10. As to his claim on  human  rights  grounds,  he  did  not  face  very
       significant obstacles to integration in Afghanistan, having only been
       in the UK since August 2016 and having spent his formative  years  in
       Afghanistan until relatively recently; he spoke the language and  was
       very familiar with the customs and culture there. Any  westernisation
       was likely to be minimal given the  limited  time  he  had  spent  in
       Europe.

   11. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law by



        a) Making an unfair finding regarding the ANSC and its CEO, a
           matter regarding which no evidence had been adduced by either
           party; additionally this approach effectively went behind the de
           facto concession in the refusal letter which had stated that the
           ANSO did exist albeit that their address was Sare Kotake Khair
           Khana District, whereas the Appellant had given it as Sarak E
           Naw, Maidan Shar;


        b) Rejecting the corroborative evidence, by way of the identity
           card and letter, only via reasoning that addressed the
           unsatisfactory nature of the latter, but without addressing the
           identity card whatsoever, so failing in the minimal duty to give
           reasons;


        c) Finding it implausible that the Appellant would have received no
           material training for his security role without fully engaging
           with the Appellant's answer at interview, which was a material
           error given that it was a critical part of the reasoning that
           led to the rejection of every aspect of his account.

   12. Although the First-tier Tribunal refused permission to appeal  on  28
       March 2018, the Upper Tribunal granted permission on all grounds on 8
       October 2018, though expressing less enthusiasm for the latter two.


   13. Mr Skinner  briefly  developed  the  grounds,  emphasising  that  the
       refusal letter had conceded the existence of the ANSO albeit  in  the
       context of rejecting the Appellant's claim to have worked for  it  on
       other grounds; he emphasised that that  adverse  credibility  finding
       was intertwined with the conclusions as a whole.  The  identity  card
       was simply not addressed which compounded the unfairness and lack  of
       adequate reasoning.

   14. Ms Everett  submitted  that  the  decision,  read  as  a  whole,  was
       defensible, in that the evidence regarding the security  company  had
       been rejected for multiple reasons; there were major discrepancies in
       the evidence. Overall the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to come to
       the findings that it made.

Findings and reasons - Error of law hearing

   15. Lord Bridge in Bugdaycay [1986] UKHL 3: "The most fundamental of  all
       human  rights  is  the  individual's  right  to  life  and  when   an
       administrative decision under challenge is said to be one  which  may
       put the applicant's life at risk, the  basis  of  the  decision  must
       surely call for the most anxious scrutiny". Asylum  appeals  must  be
       approached applying the appropriate anxious scrutiny, and as Carnwath
       LJ explained in YH [2010] EWCA  Civ  116  that  term  "has  by  usage
       acquired special significance as underlining the very  special  human
       context in which such cases are brought, and the need  for  decisions
       to show by their reasoning that every  factor  which  might  tell  in
       favour of an applicant has been properly taken into account. Carnwath
       LJ went on to warn that "Anxious scrutiny may  work  both  ways.  The
       cause of genuine asylum seekers will not be helped by undue credulity
       towards those advancing stories which  are  manifestly  contrived  or
       riddled with inconsistencies."


   16. As most recently stated by Hamblen LJ in IM  (Pakistan)  [2018]  EWCA
       Civ 626, judges do not look behind factual concessions by a party  to
       an adversarial appeal absent exceptional circumstances, such as where
       the concession is partial or unclear, or where the evidence  develops
       such that the concession requires revisiting. In  such  circumstances
       the representatives must be at once informed so that further evidence
       and submissions may be considered.

   17. In the instant case, the Secretary of State  stated  in  the  refusal
       letter that "It was  possible  to  find  Afghanistan  Nawin  Security
       Organization" online, albeit not at the same address as that provided
       by the Appellant. However, the First-tier Tribunal  found  that  "the
       ANSO  is  not  a  genuine  security  organisation".   So  whilst  the
       Secretary of State had not put the existence of ANSO  in  issue,  and
       indeed had gone some way to recognising the  potential  viability  of
       the Appellant's claim based  on  ANSO  associations,  the  First-tier
       Tribunal effectively went behind  that  position  without  notice  in
       determining the appeal on the basis that it did. The  fact  that  the
       organisation's address was expressed  differently  by  the  Appellant
       from that given  by  an  online  source  only  goes  so  far;  common
       experience indicates that organisations may have multiple  places  of
       business as well as a registered office, and  there  may  be  various
       ways of describing the same address. One simply does not know.

   18. The other refusal reasons are relatively slight.  Thus  the  identity
       card was rejected as  genuine,  essentially  applying  Tanveer  Ahmed
       thinking, simply because the ANSO letter was found not credible;  but
       once the latter finding is identified as unsafe,  the  basis  of  the
       former finding falls away. Findings predicated on immigration history
       such as failing to claim asylum in third countries can only  ever  be
       secondary in nature, as the judicial response must be evaluative, and
       very much depends on the strength of the rest of the claim. There are
       self-evident reasons why an individual  might  not  claim  asylum  in
       other European Member States that are  not  necessarily  incompatible
       with possessing a well-founded fear of persecution.

   19. As stated by Neuberger LJ in HK [2006] EWCA Civ 1037 �45,  once  some
       findings have been identified as unlawful, a  decision  may  only  be
       upheld where the tribunal is "tolerably confident that the tribunal's
       decision would have been the same on the basis of the  reasons  which
       have survived its scrutiny." It is not possible to say that the First-
       tier Tribunal would have reached the same conclusion as it did had it
       not made the significant error identified above. It must  accordingly
       be set aside.

Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law and is set aside.


    The appeal is remitted for hearing afresh.
