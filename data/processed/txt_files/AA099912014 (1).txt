                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the  Appellant,  with
    permission, against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Frankish promulgated on 27th February 2015 by which  he  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to  refuse
    to grant him further leave to remain and to return him to Iran.

2.   This was the Appellant's second appeal.  He had entered the UK on  28th
    January 2011 and claimed asylum.  His application was  refused  on  1st
    May 2011 but as a minor he was granted discretionary leave until he was
    17ï¿½ in accordance with the Secretary of State's policy.

3.   He appealed the refusal of asylum and in  a  determination  promulgated
    on 6th  June  2011  Judge  McDade  dismissed  his  appeal  finding  the
    Appellant's claims to be without credibility.

4.   The Appellant applied for further leave to remain, again citing  asylum
    grounds, prior to the expiry of his leave and it  was  the  refusal  of
    that application on 6th November 2014 that came before Judge Frankish.

5.   Judge  Frankish  set  out  the  details  of  the  claim  and  correctly
    identified that Devaseelan  [2003]  Imm  AR  1  applied  and  that  his
    starting point was thus the determination of Judge  McDade.   He  noted
    that in addition to the evidence that was before Judge McDade  and  the
    Appellant's evidence he  had  medical  reports  and  an  expert  report
    prepared by Dr KaKhki, who he noted was  an  expert  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal in the Country Guidance case of SB (risk on return  -  illegal
    exit) Iran [2009] UKAIT 00053 although, as Judge Frankish  also  noted,
    he had not concerned himself in SB with the issue of illegal  exit.  He
    did in the report before Judge Frankish.

6.   Judge Frankish found at paragraph 20 that the country  report  did  not
    counter the contradictions in the Appellant's own  evidence  identified
    by Judge McDade.  He found the report did not give reason  to  overturn
    the findings of Judge McDade.  So far as the claim that he would be  at
    risk as a draft evader (a new claim) the Judge found that  he  was  not
    taken to any direct evidence that he would be at  risk  on  return  for
    this reason.

7.   Mr Draycott's submissions, based on his grounds which  were  the  basis
    on which permission to appeal was granted, were  essentially  that  the
    Judge had relied too heavily on the findings of the previous Judge  and
    had not taken adequate notice of the expert's  report.   This  was  new
    evidence and should have been considered and if it was to be  rejected,
    proper reasons given.  In particular the Judge was wrong  to  say  that
    there was no direct evidence a about draft evasion as the expert report
    covered it.  Furthermore, the expert also dealt with the  situation  on
    the ground in villages, such as the  Appellant's,  which  rendered  the
    previous adverse credibility findings based on  implausibility  unsafe.
    The expert also gave a detailed opinion on illegal  exit,  years  after
    the Country Guidance case and  the  Judge  had  not  give  reasons  for
    rejecting that.

8.   Mr McVeety submitted that the Judge had taken the  expert  report  into
    account so far as it added new material but that  the  appeal  on  this
    occasion was not an opportunity to re-litigate  the  previous  decision
    which had been upheld.

9.   While  I  have  sympathy  with  Mr  McVeety's  submission  and  careful
    consideration will need to be  given  to  the  precise  application  of
    Devaseelan in this case and what "new evidence" should  be  taken  into
    account, that is not a  consideration  that  was  undertaken  by  Judge
    Frankish.  Further I agree that the 80 page expert report  should  have
    been given detailed consideration,  particularly  with  regard  to  the
    claims of draft evasion and  illegal  exit,  even  if  the  credibility
    aspects remain.

10.  In failing to do this the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred  and  as  the
    error of law goes to risk on return I set aside the decision and  remit
    it to the First-tier Tribunal for a full rehearing on all issues.

11.  I direct that the Appellant's representatives must file  one  composite
    bundle containing all the evidence relied upon which should be  indexed
    and paginated.  It is unacceptable to file numerous separate bundles.

12.  I suggest that the appeal be heard by a Designated Judge as  this  will
    be the third appeal and given the amount of evidence it  is  likely  to
    take a full day.

13.  The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed  to  the  extent  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and the case  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal at Stoke as set out above.

14.  The First-tier Tribunal having made an anonymity  direction  I  see  no
    reason not to continue it.
