For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Ghana, date of birth 7 June 1979  appealed
    against the Respondent's decision, dated  3  April  2013,  to  issue  a
    refusal for  a  residence  card  under  Regulations  6  and  7  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 as amended.

2.   In the Reasons for Refusal Letter is dated 3 July 2013,  the  bases  of
    refusal were that first the Appellant had not adduced evidence to  show
    that he was a family member  of  a  qualified  person  under  the  2006
    Regulations because of an absence of evidence of  the  same.  Secondly,
    the Appellant had not adduced evidence to show  a  proper  marriage  by
    proxy of the Appellant and the EEA national, a  French  national,  with
    the necessary statutory declaration that met the  requirements  of  the
    Ghanaian Customary Marriage and Divorce (Registration) Law  1985.   The
    appeal against that decision came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  N
    Manuel who, on 29 January 2014, in a decision on the  papers  dismissed
    the Appellant's appeal under  the  EEA  Regulations  and  human  rights
    grounds.

3.   Before Judge N Manuel the Appellant  was  to  produce  a  key  document
    being an amended statutory declaration of marriage, presumably to  show
    it met the requirements of the registration law of 1985.  But the  same
    was not produced nor was there evidence sufficient to show that the EEA
    national, the qualified person, was employed as  claimed  or  otherwise
    met the requirements of Regulation 6 of the 2006 Rules.

4.   The judge also found that the Appellant, who  had  not  argued  to  the
    contrary, did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE or Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules.  The judge found there was no evidence  to
    support any conclusions concerning the claimed relationship, when  they
    had met,  when  the  relationship  had  begun  and  to  show  that  the
    Respondent's decision was a disproportionate  interference.   In  those
    circumstances it was completely unsurprising that the appeal on Article
    8 private/family life grounds was dismissed.

5.   The application to the First-tier Tribunal,  which  was  refused  on  2
    April 2014 by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Davidge,  alleged  that  the
    Tribunal  had  failed  to  take  into  account  a   revised   statutory
    declaration.  However, in the papers accompanying that application,  it
    was noted by the  judge  that  no  such  document  had  been  provided.
    Further, when a renewed application to the Upper Tribunal was made  and
    considered by Upper Tribunal Judge  Macleman.   An  incomplete  bundle,
    sent in after the date of First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge's  decision
    on 2 April  2014  did  not  contain  the  claimed  revised  or  amended
    statutory declaration concerning the claimed proxy marriage. Permission
    to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Macleman, on 28 April 2014, who
    noted the absence of the  amended  statutory  declaration   before  the
    judge on 29 January 2014. It is clear  that  the  bundle  before  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Macleman did not contain the revised /amended  statutory
    declaration item 16 at pp.55-56) as he may have thought.

6.    At the hearing  on  27  May  2014  there  was  no  attendance  by  the
    Appellant  nor his representatives.  A letter from KA & Co Law Practice
    stated  ' We write that we have been instructed by our Client that  due
    to financial reasons they are unable to attend  the  hearing  scheduled
    for 27 May 2014 and ask that the Tribunal determine the appeal in their
    absence'.

6.   A incomplete bundle, with an index which  purported  to  be  dated   28
    November 2013, was sent to the First- tier Tribunal  by  KA  &  Co  Law
    Practice, by fax under cover of a letter of 5 April 2014, was  received
    on 7 April 2014.  The letter, accompanying further documents, purported
    to contain documentation previously provided to the First-tier Tribunal
    under cover of a  letter  of  28  November  2013.   The   eccentrically
    numbered bundle did not contain pages 32-33, 35-36, 37-39, 40-47, 48-56
    or a complete EEA2 form .  Page 34 was only part of the first statutory
    declaration.  There was no additional letter from the Appellant's  wife
    concerning continued employment (page 48), no recent payslips (pages 49
    to 52), no Companies House printouts (pages 53 and 54) and no  copy  of
    the revised statutory declaration (pages 55  to  56)  included  in  the
    bundle sent on 5 April 2014.

7.   There is no evidence which suggested that that bundle was ever sent  to
    the First-tier Tribunal on about 28 November 2013.

8.   There is nothing on the case file  to  show  that  a  bundle  or  cover
    letter of 28 November 2013 was ever sent to the Tribunal or received by
    it: A matter noted by Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman.  There is  nothing
    by way of Post Office registered delivery receipt or recorded  delivery
    record or track and trace or indeed a  post  book  from  KA  &  Co  Law
    Practice confirming the sending of that document on the claimed date.

9.   It was for the Appellant to show there was  a  procedural  irregularity
    as was pointed out in the permission given on 28  April  2014.  In  the
    circumstances there is no evidence to show any procedural error of  law
    or unfairness in relation to the claimed amended statutory  declaration
    or  indeed  evidence  concerning  the  qualified  person  meeting   the
    requirements of Regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations.

10.  It is  clear also that  the  Appellant  had  not  shown  the  customary
    requirements for a proxy marriage in Ghana had been met.  There was  no
    alternative basis upon which the  Appellant  succeeded  upon  under  UK
    domestic law on the basis of the claimed proxy marriage.   Applying  NA
    (customary marriage and divorce evidence) Ghana [2009] UKAIT 00009  and
    Kareem (proxy marriage - EU law) [2014] UKUT 00024 (IAC) there  was  no
    evidence that the marriage between a French  national  and  a  Ghanaian
    national was recognised under the laws of France.

11.  There was no evidence provided to discharge  the  burden  of  proof  to
    show that there was such a valid marriage and nor  was  there  evidence
    showing that such a marriage would be recognised in France nor does any
    general assertion in the grounds  carry any weight in  support  of  the
    claim there was a valid marriage.  Finally,  the  Appellant  still  has
    failed to adduce the evidence  to  show  in  the  required  period  the
    qualified person met the requirements of the 2006 Regulations. Thus  In
    the light of the decision in Kareem it is  difficult  to  see  how  any
    failure to consider the documents, if they  had  been  provided,  would
    have made any difference to the outcome of the appeal.

12.  The Original Tribunal made no  error  of  law.  The  Original  Tribunal
    decision stands.

13.  The appeal grounds did not address  Article  8  ECHR  in  the  original
    grounds to the Tribunal dated 20 July 2013.

14.  There was no attendance at the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  I  find  the
    likelihood is that any such Article 8 claim has been abandoned.   Again
    no claim was made in the grounds to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  seeking
    permission nor in the  grounds  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  alleging  the
    judge's failed to properly address Article 8 of the ECHR.

15.  The appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds was properly dismissed.

16.  The Original Tribunal made no error of  law.  The  Original  Tribunal's
    decision stands.
