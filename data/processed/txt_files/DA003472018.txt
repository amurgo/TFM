                           (ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)

                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent:    Mr S Kerr of counsel instructed by  Karis  Solicitors
Ltd



                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)



This has been a remote hearing which has been consented to by  the  parties.
The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face  to  face  hearing
was not held because  it  was  not  practicable  and  all  issues  could  be
determined in a remote hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing I  reserved
my decision, which I now give. The order made is described  at  the  end  of
these reasons.


 1. Although the Secretary of State  has  brought  this  appeal,  to  avoid
    confusion I have referred below to the parties  as  they  were  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing.

 2. The Secretary of State  has  appealed  with  permission  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated
    3.12.19, allowing the appellant's appeal against the decision to deport
    him, dated 8.5.18, supplemented by the letter of 24.7.19.

 3. At [43] of the impugned decision, the First-tier  Tribunal  found  that
    the appellant did not pose a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.  At  [46]
    the judge found  the  deportation  disproportionate.  The  appeal  was,
    therefore, allowed.

 4. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  argued  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge made a material misdirection  in  failing  to
    acknowledge that past conduct is a key consideration carrying weight in
    the  assessment  of  future  risk  and  in  failing  to  consider   the
    seriousness of the consequences of reoffending for which the  appellant
    has shown a propensity. It was also argued that the  finding  that  the
    appellant was rehabilitated was inadequately reasoned.

 5. The matter came before me for consideration of the error of  law  issue
    at a remote hearing at Manchester CJC on 21.7.20. For the  reasons  set
    out in my decision promulgated on 10.8.20, I found an error of  law  in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  requiring  the
    decision to be set aside and remade in the Upper Tribunal. In doing so,
    I granted leave to the appellant to adduce further evidence limited  to
    his  personal  and  family   circumstances,   including   as   to   his
    rehabilitation.

 6. I also agreed with the representatives at the error of law hearing that
    it would be appropriate to preserve at least some of  the  findings  of
    the First-tier  Tribunal.  Following  discussion,  I  agreed  that  the
    findings at [31(a) to (e)] of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    should be preserved, together with the concession noted at [37] of  the
    decision that the claimant is socially and culturally integrated in the
    UK.

 7. There was an abortive attempt to hold this remote  hearing  on  27.8.20
    but Mr Kerr had been sent the wrong time of  invitation  to  the  Skype
    hearing and was not available when  the  case  was  listed.  This  only
    became apparent during investigations on the day  of  the  hearing.  In
    consequence, the hearing was relisted before me on 20.11.20.

 8. The Tribunal has received the appellant's further  bundle  of  evidence
    and yesterday received the letter of 23.9.20 from the Senior  Probation
    Officer. I also have the appellant's original bundle prepared  for  the
    First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing  and  Mr  Kerr's  skeleton  argument
    relied on at the error of law hearing.

 9. Before reaching my findings in remaking the decision I  have  carefully
    considered and taken into account all  documents  and  other  evidence,
    oral and documentary, now available to the Upper  Tribunal,  considered
    in the light of the evidence taken in the round, the preserved findings
    set  out  below,  and  the  oral  submissions  made  to  me   by   both
    representatives. This  applies  whether  or  not  particular  items  of
    evidence are specifically referenced below.

10. At the remote hearing, the appellant gave oral evidence relying on  his
    original witness statement of 19.11.19 and  was  cross-examined  by  Mr
    Bates. There was no other  oral  evidence  and  the  remainder  of  the
    hearing  proceeded  by   way   of   oral   submissions   of   the   two
    representatives.

Relevant Background

11. The relevant background can be  summarised  as  follows.  The  claimant
    first entered the UK in  1999,  claiming  asylum  with  false  personal
    details as a citizen of Kosovo. That claim was refused in 2003. He must
    have left the UK at some stage, as he re-entered the UK in  2005  under
    his own name and in possession of an EEA Family  Permit  for  marriage.
    The marriage took place in 2006 and he was subsequently issued  with  a
    Residence Card valid to 2012. Although he divorced his wife in 2012, he
    was granted a further Residence Card valid to 2017, on the basis  of  a
    retained right of residence. In 2016 he was  issued  with  a  Permanent
    Residence Card, valid to 2026.

12. In April 2015, the claimant married an Albanian  national  in  Albania.
    Their child was born in 2014. He illegally smuggled his wife and  child
    into the UK in July 2015.

13. In addition to his poor immigration behaviour,  the  appellant  has  an
    antecedent criminal history going back to 2002 and involving a total of
    four appearances before the criminal courts. In 2016, he  was  arrested
    and prosecuted for offences of possession  with  intent  to  supply  of
    Class A controlled drugs,  namely  Cocaine.  An  offence  to  which  he
    pleaded not guilty and only changed his  plea  on  the  day  of  trial,
    resulting in limited credit for his plea. In November of that year,  he
    was sentenced to a term of 4 years' imprisonment. He  appealed  neither
    conviction nor sentence.

14. In December 2016 the appellant was notified that the Secretary of State
    intended to make a deportation order against him on grounds  of  public
    policy/public security, pursuant to Regulations 23(6)(b) and 27 of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016. After  considering  the  claimant's
    representations against deportation, the Secretary of State issued  the
    decision of 8.5.18 to  make  a  deportation  order.  He  appealed  that
    decision to the First-tier Tribunal.

15. In the meantime, the appellant's wife  and  first  child  were  granted
    asylum on 15.2.19, and a further child was born  in  the  UK  in  April
    2019.

The Law

16. The relevant parts of Regulation 27 provide:

         "Decisions taken on grounds of public policy, public security and
         public health

         27.- (1) In this regulation, a "relevant decision" means an EEA
             decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public
             security or public health.

             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic
             ends.

             (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a
             person with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
             except on serious grounds of public policy and public
             security.

             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous
                  period of at least ten years prior to the relevant
                  decision; or

                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision
                  is in the best interests of the person concerned, as
                  provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child
                  adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on
                  20th November 1989(17).

             (5)  The public policy and public security requirements of the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise conferred
             by these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision is taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-

                  (a)  the decision must comply with the principle of
                  proportionality;

                  (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must represent a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society, taking into
                  account past conduct of the person and that the threat
                  does not need to be imminent;

                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case or
                  which relate to considerations of general prevention do
                  not justify the decision;

                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions do not in
                  themselves justify the decision;

                  (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative grounds,
                  even in the absence of a previous criminal conviction,
                  provided the grounds are specific to the person.

             (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of
             public policy and public security in relation to a person
             ("P") who is resident in the United Kingdom, the decision
             maker must take account of considerations such as the age,
             state of health, family and economic situation of P, P's
             length of residence in the United Kingdom, P's social and
             cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of
             P's links with P's country of origin. ...

             (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the requirements
             of this regulation are met must (in particular) have regard to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations of
             public policy, public security and the fundamental interests
             of society etc.)."

17. Schedule 1 provides:

         "Considerations of public policy and public security

         1.   The EU Treaties do not impose a uniform scale of public policy
         or public security values: member States enjoy considerable
         discretion, acting within the parameters set by the EU Treaties,
         applied where relevant by the EEA agreement, to define their own
         standards of public policy and public security, for purposes
         tailored to their individual contexts, from time to time.

         Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom

         2.   An EEA national or the family member of an EEA national having
         extensive familial and societal links with persons of the same
         nationality or language does not amount to integration in the
         United Kingdom; a significant degree of wider cultural and societal
         integration must be present before a person may be regarded as
         integrated in the United Kingdom.

         3.   Where an EEA national or the family member of an EEA national
         has received a custodial sentence, or is a persistent offender, the
         longer the sentence, or the more numerous the convictions, the
         greater the likelihood that the individual's continued presence in
         the United Kingdom represents a genuine, present and sufficiently
         serious threat affecting of the fundamental interests of society.

         4.   Little weight is to be attached to the integration of an EEA
         national or the family member of an EEA national within the United
         Kingdom if the alleged integrating links were formed at or around
         the same time as-

             (a)  the commission of a criminal offence;

             (b)  an act otherwise affecting the fundamental interests of
             society;

             (c)  the EEA national or family member of an EEA national was
             in custody.

         5.   The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national or the
         family member of an EEA national who is able to provide substantive
         evidence of not demonstrating a threat (for example, through
         demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member of an EEA
         national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely
         to be proportionate.

         6.   It is consistent with public policy and public security
         requirements in the United Kingdom that EEA decisions may be taken
         in order to refuse, terminate or withdraw any right otherwise
         conferred by these Regulations in the case of abuse of rights or
         fraud, including-

             (a)  entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person
             to enter or to attempt to enter, a marriage, civil partnership
             or durable partnership of convenience; or

             (b)  fraudulently obtaining or attempting to obtain, or
             assisting another to obtain or to attempt to obtain, a right
             to reside under these Regulations.

         The fundamental interests of society

         7.   For the purposes of these Regulations, the fundamental
         interests of society in the United Kingdom include-

             (a)  preventing unlawful immigration and abuse of the
             immigration laws, and maintaining the integrity and
             effectiveness of the immigration control system (including
             under these Regulations) and of the Common Travel Area;

             (b)  maintaining public order;

             (c)  preventing social harm;

             (d)  preventing the evasion of taxes and duties;

             (e)  protecting public services;

             (f)  excluding or removing an EEA national or family member of
             an EEA national with a conviction (including where the conduct
             of that person is likely to cause, or has in fact caused,
             public offence) and maintaining public confidence in the
             ability of the relevant authorities to take such action;

             (g)  tackling offences likely to cause harm to society where
             an immediate or direct victim may be difficult to identify but
             where there is wider societal harm (such as offences related
             to the misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border dimension
             as mentioned in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning
             of the European Union);

             (h)  combating the effects of persistent offending
             (particularly in relation to offences, which if taken in
             isolation, may otherwise be unlikely to meet the requirements
             of regulation 27);

             (i)  protecting the rights and freedoms of others,
             particularly from exploitation and trafficking;

             (j)  protecting the public;

             (k)  acting in the best interests of a child (including where
             doing so entails refusing a child admission to the United
             Kingdom, or otherwise taking an EEA decision against a child);

             (l)  countering terrorism and extremism and protecting shared
             values."

Level of Protection

18. Pursuant to the Regulations, the claimant may be removed from the UK if
    his removal is justified on grounds of public policy,  public  security
    or public health. The respondent  relies  on  both  public  policy  and
    public security  grounds.  As  the  claimant  had  Permanent  Residence
    status, pursuant to Regulation 27 a decision may not be  taken  against
    him except on "serious grounds" of public policy  or  public  security,
    which is the medium level of protection. As the respondent noted in the
    refusal decision, imperative grounds are not  available  to  a  non-EEA
    national family member.

19. Pursuant  to  Regulation  27(5)(c),  the  appellant  must  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society. Other requirements of the Regulations
    include  that  the  decision  must  also  be   proportionate   to   the
    circumstances, including  the  length  of  residence,  his  social  and
    cultural integration in the UK, the extent of links to his home country
    of Albania, and take account of the various considerations set  out  in
    Regulation 27 and Schedule 1.

20. I confirm that I  have  given  careful  consideration  to  all  of  the
    relevant considerations before reaching my findings and conclusions.

Preserved Findings

21. The respondent did not challenge that the appellant  was  socially  and
    culturally integrated in the UK, which is an important  factor  in  the
    appellant's favour. I proceed on this basis, though  in  the  light  of
    paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 the weight to be given to that integration is
    a matter requiring some careful consideration, given the commission  of
    criminal acts, his time in prison, and other acts which may be regarded
    as affecting the fundamental interests of  society.  I  have  addressed
    this further below.

22. At [31(a) to (e)] of the decision the judge made a number  of  findings
    in the appellant's favour, which I  have  agreed  to  preserve  as  not
    infected by the errors of law disclosed in the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal. I take all of  these  into  account  in  my
    decision-making.

23. In summary, I preserve:

      a. That the appellant was contrite and accepted responsibility for his
         offending;

      b. That his probation report is wholly supportive and he  is  assessed
         as being a low risk of re-offending and of being a  danger  to  the
         public;

      c. That his wife and two children are supportive of him;

      d. That he is committed  to  his  family  and  has  a  caring,  loving
         relationship with them;

      e. His wife is a positive influence and was unaware of his offending;

      f. The judge also accepted the evidence of the supporting  witness  Mr
         Malik, who described the appellant as a committed  family  man  who
         wishes to turn  his  life  around  to  support  his  wife  and  two
         children.

Evidential Assessment

24. I have taken account of all the evidence in the round,  including  both
    that which was before the First-tier Tribunal and led to the  preserved
    findings set out above, and the more recent  evidence  put  before  the
    Upper Tribunal.

25. The more recent evidence  of  the  appellant's  personal  circumstances
    included a statement from Mr Malik, who was a supporting witness in the
    previous appeal hearing,  and  who  confirms  that  he  has  found  the
    appellant extremely reliable, honest, hard working, loyal, and of great
    integrity. Mr Malik was not called as an  oral  witness  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal and his evidence could not be challenged. To that extent I can
    place only limited reliance on the evidence. In any event, I find  that
    Mr Malik's glowing testimonial is rather undermined by the  appellant's
    criminal and poor immigration history, including his 1999 asylum  claim
    using false details claiming  to  be  a  citizen  of  Kosovo,  and  the
    unlawful smuggling of his wife and child into the UK. It is  not  clear
    how involved  Mr  Malik  has  been  in  the  appellant's  life,  as  he
    apparently lost touch with the appellant before his last conviction  in
    2016, and the extent of his current  involvement  remains  obscure,  so
    that the relevance of the evidence is  somewhat  limited.  In  his  own
    evidence, the appellant accepted that he lost  contact  with  Mr  Malik
    around 2006-2007 and only re-established contact in about 2016,  whilst
    serving his prison sentence. The appellant also confirmed that Mr Malik
    was "not at all" aware of his previous convictions. The appellant  said
    that he was embarrassed to make contact with  him.  However,  Mr  Malik
    purported to be aware that the appellant has recently started  his  own
    business and claims to have used his  services,  though  no  supporting
    documentation was provided to confirm that. It follows from  the  above
    that limited weight can be given to Mr Malik's evidence.

26. In relation to the claimed business the appellant has started,  I  find
    the  evidence  inadequate  and  lacking.  The  HMRC,  Companies  House,
    banking, and other business information in  the  new  bundle  tends  to
    support the claim that the  appellant  started  a  plastering  business
    around July 2020 and that he allegedly  provides  plastering  services.
    However, in addition to the concerns about the work allegedly done  for
    Mr Malik,  I  have  serious  misgivings  about  the  new  documentation
    relating to the business and relied on by the appellant as evidence  of
    rehabilitation.

27. I take into account the appellant's explanation that things  have  been
    difficult during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, whilst he has produced
    just  two  supposed  invoices  for  plastering  work  done,  the   bank
    statements he has also produced do  not  show  the  payment  for  those
    invoices were made into his  bank  account,  even  though  he  said  in
    evidence that payment was made to his bank account.

28.  The  first  invoice  is   computer-printed   under   the   appellant's
    incorporated business name and purports to invoice for  work  completed
    by 4.7.20, the date of the invoice, in the sum of �300. To that sum has
    been added �60 in VAT, making the total bill �360. However, the invoice
    does not show that the appellant is  VAT  registered  and  his  limited
    turnover does not require him to be registered. When I put  this  point
    to Mr Kerr, he could not advance any evidence that the appellant is VAT
    registered and did not seek to recall the appellant on the  matter.  It
    follows that there was no basis for the appellant to levy  VAT  on  his
    invoice. It seems that either the document is  a  fabrication,  or  the
    appellant has dishonestly charged the customer VAT.

29. The second invoice, dated 30.7.20 is in an entirely  different  format,
    handwritten on a pro-forma sheet. Whilst it says in  the  first-person,
    "I have finished all the plastering on..." (address provided), and  the
    appellant asserts that he did the plastering, he denies writing out the
    invoice. Of greater concern and the subject of cross-examination is the
    peculiar detail of the invoice which sets out the value of work done as
    �8,000 but that 20% tax was deducted in the sum of  �1,600,  leaving  a
    net bill of �6,400. The appellant insisted that the net  sum  had  been
    paid into his bank account  but  has  produced  no  bank  statement  to
    confirm that. Neither could he explain why 20% tax  had  been  deducted
    rather  than  added  to  the  invoice.  In  his  somewhat  leading  re-
    examination, Mr Kerr suggested to the appellant  that  the  explanation
    was that he was working under the Construction Industry  Scheme  (CIS),
    which might have explained his working as a sub-contractor  to  another
    business which pays his tax. However, the appellant did not  know  what
    this was and there is no evidence that supports this explanation.

30. In light of the matters set out above, I found the documents in support
    of the claim that the appellant has  started  and  been  engaged  in  a
    plastering business entirely unreliable so that I am unable  to  accept
    that he has genuinely engaged  in  any  such  business  or  earned  any
    genuine income  from  such  activity.  In  summary,  the  evidence  was
    woefully inadequate to support the claim that he has  rehabilitated  by
    starting a law-abiding business.

31. In his oral evidence the  appellant  repeated  the  assertion  that  he
    committed the drug dealing offences in order to pay off a �12,000  debt
    he had incurred to smugglers in payment for the illegal  entry  of  his
    family to the UK. He said that he was  in  financial  difficulties  and
    that at the date of being caught by the  police  �6,000  of  that  debt
    remained outstanding. Mr Bates pointed out that although the  appellant
    claimed that his Santander bank account would have shown that he was in
    financial difficulties, which account he claims has  now  been  closed,
    he has provided  only  limited  bank  statements  none  of  which  show
    financial difficulties, has not evidenced the source of  deposits  into
    the account, and has  made  no  apparent  effort  to  obtain  Santander
    evidence relating to his previous account to support the claim that  he
    was previously  in  financial  difficulties.  These  were  all  matters
    perfectly capable of resolution by the taking of  reasonable  steps  to
    obtain the evidence.

32. Whilst he claims in his witness statement that he now has no debt,  the
    appellant has produced no evidence or explanation as to  how  the  debt
    has or could have been discharged, particularly since he  was  given  a
    lengthy prison sentence  and  any  lawful  income  since  release  must
    necessarily be limited. He also claims that he has no contact now  with
    anyone he knew from the time he was involved with drugs, but  Mr  Bates
    pointed to a number of people shown to be visiting him  in  prison.  He
    claimed these were friends, though none  have  provided  statements  in
    support. The evidence on this issue remains unclear and gives  rise  to
    doubt that the appellant is truly without  financial  debt  or  related
    difficulties which he claims led to becoming involved in  drug  dealing
    in order to discharge. This, together with inadequate evidence that  he
    has turned over a new leaf by starting a business, must  undermine  the
    claim to rehabilitation and represent a continuing risk factor for  the
    future.

33. A GP letter  dated  6.6.18  confirms  that  the  appellant's  wife  had
    suffering  from  post-natal   depression   in   the   past,   requiring
    antidepressant medication and was referred to counselling. The  further
    GP letter, dated 19.8.20, states that she has been diagnosed  with  low
    mood,  anxiety  and  panic  symptoms,  recommenced  on   antidepressant
    medication and  again  been  referred  to  counselling.  The  appellant
    confirmed in his oral evidence that no such counselling has yet started
    as she had been "busy with the children". Mr Bates pointed out that  in
    questioning the appellant was unable to produce  any  evidence  of  the
    medication  prescribed  to  his  wife  or  that  she  was  taking  that
    medication. In short, the medical evidence is  woefully  inadequate  to
    demonstrate any significant adverse effect of deportation to his wife's
    mental health. However, I readily accept that removal of the  appellant
    is likely to have  some  adverse  effect  on  his  wife  and  children.
    However,  the   evidence   demonstrates   that   during   his   lengthy
    imprisonment,  with  the  help  of  friends  and  despite  anxiety  and
    depression, she managed to care for the children and herself. Whilst  I
    give weight to this  issue  in  the  proportionality  assessment,  that
    weight is necessarily limited.

34. I also reject as not credible the appellant's claim that he had  always
    wanted to plead guilty to the  drugs  offence,  and  only  pleaded  not
    guilty because his solicitor advised against admitting  his  guilt.  No
    evidential support for this assertion has been produced when  it  could
    reasonably have been  obtained  from  his  former  representatives.  In
    assessing this factor and the reliability generally of the  appellant's
    assertions, I have formed the overall view that  the  appellant  has  a
    rather loose commitment  to  the  truth.  In  particular,  I  note  his
    behaviour as outlined herein has demonstrated a number  of  aspects  of
    being either dishonest or at the very least untruthful.  This  includes
    his insurance fraud, his false  asylum  claim,  the  smuggling  of  his
    family, and the dubious invoicing for his purported business, addressed
    above.

35. I confirm that I have taken into account all  of  the  above,  together
    with the evidence assessed in the context of the whole,  including  the
    evidence in the appellant's bundle prepared for the First-tier Tribunal
    appeal hearing and the preserved findings.

36. Regulation 27(6) requires me to take account of considerations relating
    to the appellant, such as age, state of  health,  family  and  economic
    situation, length of residence, his social  and  cultural  integration,
    and links to his country of  origin.  I  have  assessed  these  factors
    below.

Are there Serious Grounds of Public Policy or Public Security?

37. In Tsakouridis C-145/09,  the  European  Court  found  that  the  fight
    against crime in connection with dealing in narcotics  as  part  of  an
    organised group is capable of being covered  by  the  concept  of  both
    'imperative grounds of public security' and  'serious grounds of public
    policy or public security.'  Although  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    omitted to take into account  the  devastating  effect  on  society  of
    organised drug-dealing, I must do so. I am satisfied that the nature of
    the offending behaviour was serious and one likely to have  devastating
    and dangerous consequences for the  general  public.  The  offence  was
    unarguably serious, as amply demonstrated  by  the  term  of  4  years'
    immediate imprisonment. To describe his last offence in terms as a 'one-
    off' would  be  to  underestimate  the  seriousness  of  the  offending
    behaviour.

38. Considering the seriousness of the criminal history in line with  Kamki
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1715, I  accept  the  respondent's  argument  that  the
    repeat offending and escalation of that offending  is  itself  strongly
    indicative of a propensity to reoffend. On the evidence,  I  find  that
    there was an escalation in offending which demonstrated  a  significant
    propensity to offend against the norms of society and which  cannot  be
    ignored. That offending also undermines the factors in  favour  of  the
    appellant's social and cultural integration. These  considerations  are
    highly relevant to the weight to be given to  evidence  of  integration
    and the threat/risk assessment.

39. Also highly relevant are the considerations in  Schedule  1,  including
    maintaining  public  confidence  in  the  ability   of   the   relevant
    authorities to take action, and tackling offences likely to cause  harm
    to society where there is wider societal harm, such as offences related
    to the misuse of drugs. Drug-dealing offences  cause  serious  harm  to
    health of those addicted and to the welfare  of  society  as  a  whole.
    There are knock-on consequences as members of  society  and  businesses
    become victims of further crimes committed  by  drug  addicts  to  fund
    their expensive habits. The effects of  dealing  in  illicit  drugs  on
    individuals, families,  communities  and  the  society  of  the  UK  is
    devastating. Organised dealing in Class A controlled drugs is a scourge
    on society in the UK. Even if  he  is  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national, without the ability to take immigration action against a non-
    British citizen such as the appellant who has  committed  very  serious
    criminal offences, the confidence of the public  would  undoubtedly  be
    undermined.

40. In the premises, and for the reasons stated, I am satisfied that on the
    facts of this case there are serious grounds of both public policy  and
    public security.

Does the Appellant Represent a Genuine,  Present  and  Sufficiently  Serious
Threat?

41. I take into account Mr Kerr's submissions which whilst  accepting  that
    any threat need not be imminent, were to the  effect  the  evidence  of
    rehabilitation is such that  the  risk  is  now  so  remote  as  to  be
    unpredictable.

42. Pursuant to paragraph [3] of Schedule 1, "the longer the  sentence,  or
    the more numerous the convictions, the greater the likelihood that  the
    individual's continued presence in the UK represents a genuine, present
    and sufficiently serious threat affecting of the fundamental  interests
    of society". The sentence of 4 years is significant. The length of  his
    incarceration reflects  the  risk  the  appellant  and  his  particular
    offending presents to society. Also to be taken  into  account  is,  as
    referenced  above,  the  seriousness  of  the   consequences   of   any
    reoffending, including a propensity to reoffend arising from the nature
    of the drug-dealing conviction, and the devastating effect  on  society
    of drug-dealing. Whilst the appellant is described as being of low risk
    of both reoffending and being a danger to the  public,  any  return  to
    such offending can have devastating and dangerous consequences for  the
    public. As stated, past conduct is a strong indication of future  risk.
    This risk, even  if  assessed  as  low  by  the  appellant's  probation
    officer, cannot be ignored in the threat assessment. In this regard,  I
    note that there is no updated assessment from  the  probation  officer,
    despite the recent letter of 23.9.20, which states  little  other  than
    that his licence has been completed without adverse incident.

43. In assessing whether the appellant represented a genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to one or more of the fundamental interests
    of society, I have previously found that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    erred by omitting to address and take into account  the  escalation  in
    offending behaviour represented by the index  drug-dealing  conviction,
    apparently considering the offence  a  'one-off'.  I  must  take  these
    factors into account.  In  assessing  the  threat,  I  also  note  that
    Regulation 27(5)(c) provides that to  be  taken  into  account  is  the
    appellant's past conduct  and  that  the  future  threat  need  not  be
    imminent.

Rehabilitation

44. Relevant to the threat assessment is the issue of  rehabilitation.  The
    respondent argues that a relatively short period out of  prison  whilst
    on licence does not demonstrate that the appellant is rehabilitated. In
    this regard, I have to bear in mind the way in  which  the  Regulations
    consider rehabilitation and in particular  take  into  account  of  the
    consideration at paragraph [5] of Schedule 1: that the removal from the
    UK of the family member of an EEA  national  who  is  able  to  provide
    "substantive evidence of  not  demonstrating  a  threat  (for  example,
    through demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member of  an
    EEA national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely
    to be proportionate."

45. Whilst the relevance is to the overall proportionality of the decision,
    the reference is to 'substantive evidence' and in particular,  but  not
    exclusively, evidence that  appellant  has  'successfully  reformed  or
    rehabilitated.' Whilst challenging the conclusion  that  the  appellant
    was rehabilitated, the respondent did not  challenge  the  evidence  on
    that issue relied on by the appellant. In my  grant  of  permission,  I
    considered the judge's conclusion that the appellant  is  rehabilitated
    questionable. However, in my error of law decision, I concluded that on
    the available evidence and for the reasons  set  out  in  the  decision
    that, although a different judge may reach a different conclusion given
    the offending history and relatively short  period  out  of  prison  on
    licence, it was nevertheless open to the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  to
    conclude at [31] of the decision that the  appellant  had  "learnt  the
    error of his ways and is rehabilitated." However, I  did  not  preserve
    this finding and it remains  open  for  reconsideration  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

46. In relation to the issue of  rehabilitation,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge relied on:

      a. the fact that the appellant  had  been  out  in  the  community  on
         licence for some 18 months;

      b. the positive probation report;

      c. the appellant's attendance on remedial courses;

      d. drug-testing;

      e. the appellant's family support; and

      f. the conclusion that the appellant had  "learnt  the  error  of  his
         ways" and was contrite.

47. It is now the case that as of  26.6.20,  the  appellant's  licence  has
    expired and his  period  of  probation  completed.  The  recent  Senior
    Probation Officer  letter,  dated  23.9.20,  states  that  he  complied
    throughout the probation period and attended  all  appointments.  There
    were no enforcement issues, further offending, or risk escalation.  The
    letter is very short and, whilst it is to the appellant's  credit  that
    he has successfully completed his licence and probation, little else of
    positive value is stated. In relation to rehabilitation, I accept  that
    to the period since release is to be added the successful completion of
    his licence  with  no  further  offending.  This  is  further  positive
    evidence of rehabilitation, which I take fully into  account,  together
    with the low risk of harm and reoffending.

48. I also take into account that separating the appellant from his  family
    may tend impede further rehabilitation as he  would  be  without  their
    positive  influence  and  relieved  of  his  responsibility  for  them.
    However, there is no reason why he could not complete rehabilitation in
    Albania. Neither it is necessarily the case that  the  family  will  be
    separated  indefinitely.  Whilst  his  wife  cannot  reasonably  go  to
    Albania, the appellant was challenged in cross-examination as to why he
    and his family could not meet in a third-country. He did  not  directly
    answer the question, stating only that his wife was scared to move from
    the UK.

49. Whilst I do not doubt that a person can be  successfully  rehabilitated
    over a shorter period than 18 months or two years, each case has to  be
    considered on its merits. I have also to bear in mind that past conduct
    is indicative of future risk and that there was an  escalation  in  the
    appellant's offending behaviour. In reality, taking  into  account  all
    the matters addressed above, there  is  relatively  little  substantive
    evidence that the appellant has successfully reformed or rehabilitated.
    The evidence in support includes the factors relied on  by  the  judge,
    referenced above, and the further extended period up until now,  within
    which the appellant has not reoffended. However, that is not  a  factor
    of any great credit as not offending is no  more  than  that  which  is
    expected of any resident of the UK. Further, other evidence that  might
    support the claim of rehabilitation is somewhat lacking and  does  not,
    in my view, demonstrate a completed,  successful,  rehabilitation.  For
    example, the supporting witness Mr Malik's evidence is rather  limited,
    for the reasons I have set out above. In particular, the good character
    described did not dissuade the appellant from becoming  a  drug-dealer.
    Whilst  the  appellant  has  a  genuine,   subsisting   and   committed
    relationship to his wife and children, those positive factors  did  not
    prevent him committing criminal offences and becoming a drug-dealer. If
    the appellant's licence period during which he  was  under  supervision
    has now ceased, it has only recently done so. Whilst he may be  on  the
    path towards rehabilitation, I find that on the  facts  of  this  case,
    considered as a whole,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  appellant  has
    demonstrated  to  any  substantive  degree  that  he  has  successfully
    reformed or rehabilitated. These findings  are  relevant  to  both  the
    threat  assessment  and   the   proportionality   balancing   exercise,
    considered below.

50. I take all of those considerations  into  account  in  the  appellant's
    favour and they are not to be undervalued, particularly  the  probation
    risk assessment. However, I have to bear in mind that the appellant was
    only released from prison in 2018 and for most of the  past  two  years
    has been on licence and at risk of return. Licence is an  intention  on
    an offender's behaviour. He has spent a  further  period  without  that
    threat, a little under 6 months, which I also take into account.

51. Although the risk of reoffending was assessed as low,  I  am  satisfied
    that there remains a threat and if the appellant were  to  reoffend  by
    further drug-dealing, the likelihood of  real  harm  is,  in  my  view,
    considerable and not to be under-estimated.

Weight to be Given to Integration

52. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 provides that extensive familial or  societal
    links with persons of the same nationality or language does not  amount
    to integration and a significant degree of wider  cultural  integration
    must be present before a person may be regarded as  integrated  in  the
    UK.

53. However, as stated above, the respondent  did  not  challenge  that  in
    essence the appellant was socially and culturally integrated in the UK.
    However, as also referenced above, paragraph 4 of  Schedule  1  directs
    that little weight is to be attached  to  integration  if  the  alleged
    integrating links were formed  at  or  around  the  same  time  as  the
    commission of a criminal  offence,  "an  act  otherwise  affecting  the
    fundamental interests of society", and time spent in  custody.  Clearly
    the time during which the appellant's various  criminal  offences  were
    committed, which is not insignificant, comes within this paragraph.  As
    does his time in custody, for obvious  reasons.  In  cross-examination,
    the appellant explained that his January 2016 conviction, which offence
    was committed over a  period  of  time  in  2015,  was  the  fraudulent
    provision of a false address outside of London in  order  to  obtain  a
    lower insurance premium.  Quite  clearly,  unlike  his  early  motoring
    offences including driving  with  excess  alcohol  and  an  offence  of
    criminal damage, this was  a  matter  of  dishonesty,  undermining  the
    motoring insurance system. I am also  satisfied  that  the  appellant's
    poor immigration history, making a false asylum claim and smuggling his
    family into the UK, are acts which  adversely  affect  the  fundamental
    interests of society. It follows that the weight that can attach to his
    integration is necessarily limited but I accord such weight as I can in
    the circumstances.

54. In the premises,  taking  all  factors  into  account  in  the  balance
    including the low risk assessment and previous positive report  of  his
    probation officer, I am satisfied for the reasons set out  herein  that
    on the facts of this  case  the  appellant  continues  to  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to one or more of  the
    two fundamental interests of society relied on by the respondent.

Proportionality Balancing Exercise

55. In my error of law decision, I found that the First-tier  Tribunal  had
    engaged in unwarranted speculation as to the effect of the  appellant's
    removal on his partner and children, when, as the  judge  noted,  there
    was no evidence on that issue. This was  relevant  to  and  skewed  the
    proportionality assessment. I have now received further evidence in the
    appellant's latest bundle, prepared for the remaking of  the  decision,
    all which I have taken into account, including that his wife previously
    suffered mental health issues and has recently been  diagnosed  with  a
    recurrence  of  anxiety  and   depressive   symptoms   warranting   the
    prescription  of  antidepressant  medication   and   a   referral   for
    counselling.

56. I have taken into account the positive character reference of Mr  Malik
    and  other  evidence  in  the  appellant's   bundles   suggesting   his
    integration in the UK.  I  remind  myself  of  the  preserved  positive
    factors, including the genuine and subsisting family relationships  and
    mutual support and  positive  influence.  I  also  recognise  that  the
    appellant's deportation will have a  negative  effect  on  his  family,
    including, potentially,  to  worsen  his  wife's  depressive  symptoms.
    However, it is the nature of the severe sanction of deportation that it
    separates family  members;  harsh  effects  almost  inevitably  follow.
    Sadly, that is entirely the responsibility of  the  appellant  and  the
    consequence of his serious offending behaviour whilst in  this  country
    with an entitlement to remain only as the former family  member  of  an
    EEA national exercising Treaty  rights  in  the  UK  (from  a  previous
    relationship).  However,  he  has  been  here  a  lengthy  period,  and
    qualifies for permanent residence so that only strong  grounds  justify
    removal.

57. Whilst the appellant's family may not be able to return to Albania  and
    they have the right to remain in  the  UK,  it  remains  open  for  the
    appellant and his family to seek a third country in which  to  continue
    their family life. Devastating the consequences of separation  may  be,
    the mere fact of such separation does not  justify  setting  aside  the
    deportation order; otherwise few deportations could  ever  take  place.
    With every sympathy for the relatively minor mental  health  issues  of
    the appellant's wife, there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that
    regaining  full  health  is  dependent  on  the  appellant's  continued
    presence, or that for any other reason his presence is  necessary.  She
    has access to appropriate medical care and other support for herself or
    her children will be available from state services.

58. I have  also  taken  into  account  as  a  primary  but  not  paramount
    consideration the best interests of the appellant's  children  pursuant
    to s55 of the 2009 Act, which in an ideal world would be to  remain  in
    the UK with the continued presence and active role of the appellant  as
    their father. However, no assessment of the children's  best  interests
    has been put before the Tribunal. Other than the  obvious  implications
    of further separation, there  is  no  indication  that  the  children's
    welfare and future development depend in  any  particular  way  on  his
    continued presence in the UK.  I also note that his wife  was  able  to
    care for their children in the appellant's absence without any evidence
    of detrimental effect. In the premises, taking everything into  account
    in the context of the whole, I am satisfied that the public interest in
    the  appellant's  removal  from  the  UK  as  a  convicted  drug-dealer
    outweighs those best interests.

59. I have also  considered  any  negative  effect  on  completion  of  the
    rehabilitation process by the appellant's removal but, as stated above,
    I am not satisfied that he will be unable to complete rehabilitation in
    Albania, and there is no evidence to support such a suggestion. I  also
    recognise that he has  very  recently  established  a  limited  company
    business and has purportedly commenced trading in an effort to  provide
    for himself and his family. I have set out above my concerns about  the
    limitations of this evidence. However, such skills as he has,  together
    with his good health, can undoubtedly be put to  good  use  in  finding
    employment on return to Albania in order to support himself.

60. Considering all relevant factors  in  the  round  together  with  those
    matters urged on me in the oral submissions at the remaking hearing,  I
    have found, for the reasons set out  above,  that  serious  grounds  of
    public  policy  and/or  public   security   are   present,   that   his
    rehabilitation remains incomplete and that limited weight can be  given
    to the evidence of  rehabilitation,  and  that  as  a  former  foreign-
    national drug-dealer who has served a significant custodial sentence he
    continues to represent a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one  or  more  of  the  fundamental  interests  of  UK
    society, even though the risk of re-offending is assessed as low.

61. In the premises, taking account of his personal circumstances  and  all
    other relevant considerations set out in Regulation 27 and Schedule  1,
    including the effect of his separation on his wife  and  children,  the
    best interests of the children, and the  positive  character  reference
    and steps he has taken towards providing for his  family,  I  find  the
    decision to remove  the  appellant  entirely  proportionate.  In  other
    words, the public interest in his removal outweighs  those  factors  in
    the appellant's favour. It follows that  the  appellant's  appeal  must
    fail.

Anonymity Direction

I am satisfied, having had  regard  to  the  guidance  in  the  Presidential
Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders, that it would  be  appropriate
to make an order in accordance with  Rules  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in the following terms:

    "Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellant
    is granted anonymity. No report of these proceedings shall directly  or
    indirectly identify him or any member of  his  family.  This  direction
