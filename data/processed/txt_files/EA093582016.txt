THE IMMIGRATION ACTS



Determined at Field House without a hearing 

On 20 June 2018

Decision & Reasons Promulgated 

On 22 June 2018











Before



UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE RINTOUL



Between



 MUHAMMAD BILAL

(NO ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)

Appellant



and



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Respondent





DECISION AND REASONS





		On 30 May 2018, the Upper Tribunal directed that in the light of Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 and SM (Algeria) [2018] UKSC 9, it was minded to find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal and to remit it to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.  No objection to the proposed course of action has been received. Accordingly, I am satisfied that I can proceed to determine the appeal in accordance with the directions made and without an oral hearing. 



		I am satisfied that that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error of law for the reasons set out above, and must therefore be set aside.  Given the nature of the error, I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh determination on all issues.





Summary of conclusions



The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error of law and I set it aside. 



I remit the decision to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision on all issues



The appeal must not be before First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert
