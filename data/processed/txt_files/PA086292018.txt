                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge John Lever), sitting at Newport on 29 August  2018,  to
    a protection appeal by  a  Sunni  Kurdish  citizen  of  Iraq,  born  23
    November  1989.  Permission  was  given  in  the  Upper  Tribunal,   on
    credibility and internal relocation grounds.

 2. The decision of the  very  experienced  judge  is  noteworthy  for  its
    clarity and concision: though Mr Magennis was inclined to criticize  it
    for being too short for an Iraqi case, brevity is of course  a  virtue,
    so long as  everything  necessary  is  included.  The  judge's  salient
    findings of fact were as follows, so far as he was prepared  to  accept
    the appellant's case as reasonably likely to be true.

FACTS

 3. The appellant's father may have been a Ba'ath governing  party  member,
    under the Saddam Hussein r�gime, till that fell  to  allied  forces  in
    2003. He had been an ordinary conscript soldier  in  Saddam's  Army  at
    various times, till his pay-book recorded his  final  discharge  on  20
    April 1991. He may have had a local r�le as an informant  or  collector
    of information for the Ba'ath party; but he did not have any high  rank
    in the Army, or anywhere else. Nor was the  judge  prepared  to  accept
    that the appellant would have seen him in any uniform suggesting  that,
    since he was less than 18 months old when his father received his final
    discharge.

 4. From the fall of Saddam in 2003 till 2015, the appellant and his family
    lived in peace in their home city of Diyala,  now  a  'contested  area'
    between the Kurds  and  the  present  Government.  While  some  Sunnis,
    including former Ba'ath members, had turned to ISIS ['Islamic State  of
    Iran and Syria', now more usually known as Da'esh], the  appellant  did
    not claim that his father had actually done so; and the judge  was  not
    prepared to accept that he had fallen under any such suspicion.

 5. That meant  that  the  judge  was  also  not  prepared  to  accept  the
    d�nouement of the appellant's case, which came, he said, when  in  2015
    persons unknown had killed his father outside the city. After the  body
    was brought to the family house and they  received  threats,  they  had
    gone to live in  another  town  called  Kifiri  (or  Kefri),  about  40
    minutes' drive away in a hired pick-up from Diyala. There they had  had
    no threats; but they were still worried about the risk they might  run,
    because of the father.

 6. However, and there is nothing to suggest that the judge did not  accept
    this, the appellant couldn't get a job in Kifiri, so decided  to  leave
    Iraq altogether. He did not take any documents  with  him,  as  he  was
    travelling illegally at night, and did not pass any  check-points.  The
    appellant's mother was too old to travel, but begged him  to  go.  From
    Erbil the appellant went to the Turkish border, and was taken  over  by
    lorry on 4 August 2016.

 7. From Turkey the appellant travelled through Greece, Italy (in  both  of
    which countries he was finger-printed by the authorities,  but  without
    claiming asylum, then by way of France and Belgium, arriving here on  1
    April 2017 and claiming asylum two  days  later.  The  judge  held  the
    appellant's failure to claim en route against  him,  as  an  additional
    reason for not believing the main part of his account.

 8. Finally the judge dealt with internal  relocation,  since  he  accepted
    that, whatever had or had not happened, the country guidance  showed  a
    general article 15 (c) risk in Diyala. That meant,  since  he  did  not
    come from or have family in the IKR [Independent Kurdish Region],  that
    Baghdad was the only realistic alternative destination.

 9. Dealing with return to Baghdad, the judge noted that the appellant  had
    left his ID and passport with his mother, who had been able to send him
    his father's pay-book, when he asked her for documents to  support  his
    case during 2017. The  judge  was  not  prepared  to  accept  that  the
    appellant was no longer in touch with his mother, owing to  losing  his
    mobile phone in July 2018, and took the view that she  would  still  be
    able to send him his CSID and passport.

10. This meant that, since the appellant could be returned to Baghdad  with
    those documents, and was a healthy young man, the judge took  the  view
    that he could safely go  there,  without  any  breach  of  the  Refugee
    Convention, article 15 (c)  of  the  Qualification  Directive,  or  his
    rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.

GROUNDS

11. I shall briefly review the appellant's rather lengthy  grounds,  before
    dealing with them in what seems to me logical order.

      1. raises a point on what is said to be the background risk to  Sunnis
         suspected of ISIS sympathies.

      2. suggests that all Sunnis are at risk of kidnapping in Baghdad,  and
         generally from  'popular  mobilisation  forces'  belonging  to  the
         Shi'a.

      3. blames the judge for not considering  the  appellant's  submissions
         about his route of return to the IKR.  I  fail  to  understand  the
         point of this, as the judge accepted he could not go there.

      4. deals with the appellant's prospects  of  getting  his  own,  or  a
         replacement CSID.

      5. is about the correct test for internal relocation, and the  factors
         to be considered.

      6. refers to the appellant's family coming from a contested area,  and
         the difficulties they are said inevitably to have faced there.

      7. is about the risk to the appellant in his home area from  what  had
         happened to his  father;  however  I  do  not  read  the  judge  as
         accepting this (see 5).

      8. suggests that Ba'ath Party  sympathies  would  be  imputed  to  the
         appellant, whether he had them or not.

      9. is about whether the appellant could have  been  expected  to  know
         what his father had been doing after his discharge from the Army.

12. Those grounds which are about the risk to the  appellant  in  his  home
    area are essentially irrelevant to the result, since the judge accepted
    that he could not be expected to return there. There is  no  indication
    that any of them would lead to a risk, or an increased risk, or to  its
    being more 'unduly harsh' than otherwise for him to return to  Baghdad.
    That is of course the correct test (see Januzi [2006] UKHL  5),  though
    it is understandable that the judge should have dealt with return there
    mainly in terms of risk.

13. The relevant grounds are 2, 4 and 5, and the logical starting-point  is
    5. At a late stage in the hearing, Mr Magennis sought to argue that the
    appellant's CSID had not been among the papers  kept  for  him  by  his
    mother when he left. However, this point was not raised in the grounds,
    and in any case the judge was fully justified in taking the  references
    to ID at paragraphs 13 - 14 of the appellant's statement in that way.

CONCLUSIONS

14. At paragraph 13 the appellant described how he had asked his mother  to
    send over any papers which might help his case, and she had  duly  sent
    his father's pay-book. He went on to say that he had not asked for  his
    ID card or passport "... because I did not think I  would  need  them".
    Clearly he did not think they would help his case, and  the  judge  was
    also justified in rejecting his explanation that he had lost touch with
    his mother, together with his phone.

15. It follows that the judge needed to deal with the appellant's situation
    on return to Baghdad as a Sunni Kurd, with a CSID, in the light of  the
    'unduly harsh' criterion  and  the  factors  set  out  in  the  country
    guidance. While the judge certainly referred to  the  relevant  country
    guidance (AA (Iraq) [2017] EWCA Civ 944, BA (Returns  to  Baghdad  Iraq
    CG) [2017] UKUT 18 (IAC), and AAH (Iraqi Kurds -  internal  relocation)
    (CG) [2018] UKUT 212 (IAC)), he did not discuss any particular factors,
    apart from the appellant's youth, health and potential possession of  a
    CSID. No doubt he knew what he was looking for in the country guidance;
    but there is nothing in his paragraph 27 to let the reader know what he
    considered, or considered relevant, or what view he took on it.

16. Looking at the country guidance factors  set  out  in  the  appellant's
    skeleton argument before the judge, the  relevant  points  for  present
    purposes are these (AAH is essentially about returns to the IKR):

         AA

         14.  As a general matter, it will not be unreasonable or unduly
         harsh for a person from a contested area to relocate to Baghdad
         City ...

         15.  In assessing whether it would be unreasonable/unduly harsh for
         P to relocate to Baghdad, the following factors are, however,
         likely to be relevant:

             (a)    ...

             (b)    whether P can speak Arabic (those who cannot are less
             likely to find employment);

             (c)    whether P has family members or friends in Baghdad able
             to accommodate him;

             (d)    ...

             (e)    whether P can find a sponsor to access a hotel room or
             rent accommodation;

             (f)    whether P is from a minority community;

             (g)    whether there is support available for P bearing in
             mind there is some evidence that returned failed asylum
             seekers are provided with the support generally given to IDPs.

         BA

         (iv) Kidnapping has been, and remains, a significant and persistent
         problem contributing to the breakdown of law  and  order  in  Iraq.
         Incidents of kidnapping are likely to be underreported. Kidnappings
         might  be  linked  to  a  political  or  sectarian  motive;   other
         kidnappings are rooted in criminal activity for a purely  financial
         motive. Whether a returnee from the West is likely to be  perceived
         as a potential target for kidnapping in Baghdad may depend  on  how
         long he or she has been away from Iraq.  Each  case  will  be  fact
         sensitive, but in principle, the longer a person has  spent  abroad
         the greater the risk. However, the evidence does not  show  a  real
         risk to a returnee in Baghdad on this ground alone.

17. Dealing first with the kidnapping point  (ground  2),  there  was  some
    evidence before the judge (in  an  Amnesty  International  report  from
    2014) that Sunnis face an increased risk of it.  However  that  is  not
    referred to in the country guidance in BA, as might have been  expected
    if it had still been relevant; and there is said to be no real risk  on
    this ground alone. The passage cited also suggests that those who  have
    been away for longer than this appellant, and so  may  be  expected  to
    offer more money, are the ones mainly at risk.

18. Nor, from AA, is there any risk on return to Baghdad generally: however
    the 'unduly harsh' factors listed at 15 (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) were
    clearly relevant. It is not clear what the judge  would  have  made  of
    these points, if he had set them out in terms  of  the  'unduly  harsh'
    test. There is however nothing wrong with the rest of his  decision  on
    return to Baghdad, and I see no reason why he should not  be  asked  to
    resume his hearing and deal with these factors.
