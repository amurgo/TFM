                  Before Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor




            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr S Knafler QC, and Ms S  Pinder,  of  Counsel,
instructed on a Direct Access basis, on behalf of the applicants  and  Mr  T
Tabori, of Counsel,  instructed  by  the  Government  Legal  Department,  on
behalf of the respondents, at a hearing  conducted  on  25  August  2020  by
Skype for Business with the Upper Tribunal sitting at Field House, London.


      Decision: the application for judicial review is GRANTED


INTRODUCTION


   1. The applicants are both citizens of Egypt.  At all material times,  Mr
      Taha ("AT") has resided in Egypt, whilst Mrs Botros ("MB") has resided
      in Kuwait.  Since 2013, AT has been the Managing Director of a company
      called Regents Education Services.   This  company,  based  in  Egypt,
      introduces  potential  students  residing  in  the  Middle   East   to
      educational institutions based in the United Kingdom.   Commission  is
      paid to the company by such an institution  if  an  individual  enters
      into an educational contract with it.


   2. By applications made  on  18  April  2018,  AT  and  MB  sought  entry
      clearance  for  leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom   as   Tier   1
      Entrepreneurs, pursuant to paragraph 245DB of  the  Immigration  Rules
      ("the Rules").  AT applied to  the  entry  clearance  post  in  Egypt,
      whilst MB applied in  Kuwait.   They  put  themselves  forward  as  an
      entrepreneurial team.  It was proposed that AT and MB would  establish
      a business together in the United Kingdom.   This  enterprise  was  to
      take the form of an  educational  consultancy  service  predicated  on
      facilitating foreign students from the Middle East to come  and  study
      in the United Kingdom.  It would also provide ancillary services  such
      as finding accommodation for students and suchlike.  The business plan
      submitted with the  applications  emphasised  the  relevance  of  AT's
      experience and contacts in the Middle East and the United Kingdom.  In
      essence, it was said that the new venture would be a logical extension
      of Regents Educational Services.

   3. Both applicants were interviewed separately and at the same time on 17
      May 2018.  The answers provided at those interviews are central to the
      issues in these proceedings.


   4. The applications were refused by  the  respondent  on  13  June  2018.
      Administrative Review was sought, and on 16  July  2018  the  original
      refusals  were  maintained  in  full.   The  Pre-Action  Protocol  was
      complied with and an  application  for  judicial  review  made  on  11
      October 2018.  Permission was refused on the papers and then upon oral
      renewal.  The latter decision was appealed to  the  Court  of  Appeal.
      Permission was granted by the Court on 31 December 2019.  By way of  a
      Consent Order sealed on 26 February 2020, the appeals were allowed and
      permission to apply for judicial review was granted.  The  cases  were
      then case managed by the Upper Tribunal and set down for a substantive
      hearing.

   5. That hearing took place on a remote basis using the Skype for Business
      platform.  Save for some limited interference with Mr  Tabori's  audio
      connection which did not affect his ability  to  put  forward  and  my
      reception  of  his  submissions,   the   hearing   proceeded   without
      difficulty.  Both of the applicants "attended" remotely.

   THE RULES


   6. Paragraph 245DB of the Rules provided, as at the date of the decisions
      and insofar as relevant to these proceedings, as follows (it is to  be
      noted that the Tier 1 Entrepreneur route was closed to new  applicants
      in March 2019):


           "245DB. Requirements for entry clearance


           To qualify for  entry  clearance  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
           Migrant, an applicant must meet the requirements  listed  below.
           If the applicant meets those requirements, entry clearance  will
           be granted. If the applicant does not meet  these  requirements,
           the application will be refused.


           Requirements:
           (a) The applicant must not fall for refusal  under  the  general
           grounds for refusal.


           (b) The applicant  must  have  a  minimum  of  75  points  under
           paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix A.


           (c) The applicant  must  have  a  minimum  of  10  points  under
           paragraph 1 to 15 of Appendix B.


           (d) The applicant  must  have  a  minimum  of  10  points  under
           paragraph 1 to 2 of Appendix C.


           (e) An applicant who has, or was last granted, leave as a Tier 4
           Migrant and:
                 (i)  is  currently  being  sponsored  by  a  government  or
                 international scholarship agency, or
                 (ii) was being sponsored by a government  or  international
                 scholarship agency, and that sponsorship came to an end  12
                 months ago or less,
           must provide the unconditional written consent of the sponsoring
           Government or agency to the application  and  must  provide  the
           specified documents as set out in paragraph 245A above, to  show
           that this requirement has been met.


           (f) Where the applicant is  being  assessed  under  Table  4  of
           Appendix A, the Entry Clearance Officer must be satisfied that:
                 (i)  the  applicant  genuinely  intends  and  is  able   to
                 establish, take over or become a director of  one  or  more
                 businesses in the UK within the next six months;
                 (ii) the applicant genuinely intends to  invest  the  money
                 referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A  in  the  business  or
                 businesses referred to in (i);
                 (iii) that the money referred to in Table 4 of  Appendix  A
                 is genuinely available to the applicant,  and  will  remain
                 available to him until such time as it  is  spent  for  the
                 purposes of his business or businesses;
                 (iv) if the applicant is relying on one  or  more  previous
                 investments to score points, they have  genuinely  invested
                 all or part of the investment funds required in Table 4  of
                 Appendix A into one or more genuine businesses in the UK;
                 (v) that the applicant does not intend to  take  employment
                 in the  United  Kingdom  other  than  under  the  terms  of
                 paragraph 245DC.


           (g) The applicant must provide a business plan, setting out  his
           proposed business activities in the UK and  how  he  expects  to
           make his business succeed.


           (h) In making the assessment in (f), the Entry Clearance Officer
           will assess the balance of probabilities.  The  Entry  Clearance
           Officer may take into account the following factors:
                 (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;
                 (ii) the viability and credibility of  the  source  of  the
                 money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;
                 (iii) the viability  and  credibility  of  the  applicant's
                 business  plan  and  market  research  into  their   chosen
                 business sector;
                 (iv) the  applicant's  previous  educational  and  business
                 experience (or lack thereof);
                 (v)  the  applicant's  immigration  history  and   previous
                 activity in the UK; and
                 (vi) any other relevant information.


           ..."


   7. Successful applicants would have been granted a period of three  years
      entry clearance, conferring leave to enter the United Kingdom.

THE DECISIONS UNDER CHALLENGE

   8. The wording of the refusals of AT's and MB's  applications  is  almost
      identical.  Neither fell foul of  the  general  grounds  for  refusal.
      Both were awarded the requisite points under Appendices A-C.  Thus, it
      was accepted that: the applicants had access to the required �200,000;
      that these funds were held in regulated financial  institutions;  that
      the money was disposable in the United  Kingdom;  that  they  met  the
      appropriate English  language  level;  and  that  they  were  able  to
      maintain themselves in this country.


   9. The applications  were  refused  under  sub-paragraph  245DB(f),  with
      reference also to (h).   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  reasons  in
      respect of AT's refusal read as follows:

           "During your interview you stated that the �100,000 that you are
           contributing to the Attributes requirement was received into
           your bank account in multiple deposits.  However, your business
           partner states that she provided these funds to you in a single
           deposit.  These discrepancies raise concerns over the viability
           and credibility of the source of your funds.


           You were asked during your interview what role you intend to
           undertake in the business.  You stated that he will oversee
           daily operations: marketing activities and sales enquiries.
           However, your business partner indicated that your role will
           cover "the financial side of the business".  I do not find it
           credible that a genuine entrepreneurial team would not have
           agreed or know their intended roles before investing �200,000
           into a business in the UK.  These concerns undermine the
           viability and credibility of your business plan and market
           research.


           During your interviews you and your business partner were asked
           to provide the estimated turnover, gross profit and net profit
           for the first year of your intended business.  I note you agreed
           on your estimated turnover and gross profit.  However, you
           estimated you would "break even" regarding net profit, whereas
           your business partner stated your business would make �8000.  I
           do not find it credible that a genuine entrepreneurial team
           would not have agreed the expected profitability of their
           business before investing �200,000.  These concerns further
           undermine the viability and credibility of your business plan
           and market research.


           When your business partner was asked to provide a breakdown of
           how your team's �200,000 would be spent on your business she
           stated "I can't remember the numbers my partner will know more
           as he is more responsible into the financial side".  I note
           again that this contradicts the role you stated you would
           undertake.  Furthermore I do not find it credible for a genuine
           entrepreneurial team that each team member would not be familiar
           with how funds would be invested in their business.


           Given these concerns I am not satisfied of the credibility of
           the source of your team's funds, that your team genuinely intend
           to invest at least �200,000 into one or more UK business, or
           that your business plan and market research is viable and
           credible.  Your application is therefore refused under paragraph
           245DB(f) and (h) of the Immigration Rules."

  10. In respect of MB's refusal, the very same points are made, although of
      course reference is made to the information provided by  her  business
      partner, namely AT.


  11. For ease of reference and in view of the way in  which  the  arguments
      have been put to me, I will hereafter refer  to  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officers' bases of refusal as "reasons 1-4".  These reflect  the  four
      points taken against the applicants, as set out in paragraph 9, above.


  12. As is the case with entry clearance applications such  as  those  with
      which I am concerned here, the ability to seek  Administrative  Review
      was limited.  Only evidence submitted with the  original  applications
      would be considered.

  13. In summary, the Administrative Review decisions  upheld  the  original
      refusals in full.  I note here a couple of points  arising  from  AT's
      decision.  First, when referring to the issue of  whether  there  were
      multiple deposits or a single deposit, the  reviewing  officer  stated
      that, "[w]hilst your documents may confirm the statements made in  the
      review ground [namely that there had been a  misunderstanding  by  the
      interviewing officer], the interview is  to  test  your  knowledge  to
      determine the credibility of your application."  Second,  it  is  said
      that:

           "There is no doubt the ECO  has  considered  the  documents  and
           business plan that were submitted with the application.  However
           the interview is to test your knowledge of the business plan."

THE PARTIES' RESPECTIVE CASES

  14. Without intending any disrespect to Counsel, I propose to set out  the
      parties' respective cases in summary form only, having had full regard
      to the clear and concise written and oral arguments which had been put
      forward.  There have been no amendments to the applicants' grounds  of
      challenge, nor any material concessions by the respondents.


  15. Both parties have  referred  to  three  authorities  throughout  their
      arguments; Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673; [2019] 1 WLR  4647,  R  (on
      the  application  of  Anjum)  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Islamabad
      (entrepreneur - business expansion - fairness generally)  [2017]  UKUT
      406 (IAC), and R (on the application of  Mushtaq)  v  Entry  Clearance
      Officer of Islamabad, Pakistan (ECO - procedural fairness) IJR  [2015]
      UKUT 224 (IAC).  I will deal with these  in  appropriate  detail  when
      setting out my conclusions, below.

The applicants' case

  16. AT and MB assert that the respondent's refusals of their  applications
      are, in the first instance, irrational.  It is said that, on a  proper
      analysis of the answers provided by the applicants at their respective
      interviews, the conclusion that they were  not  genuine  entrepreneurs
      was, in all the circumstances, not one which could have been  properly
      reached.  Mr Knafler  emphasised  the  uncontroversial  facts  of  the
      applicants' background,  the  availability  of  requisite  funds,  the
      successful existing business, and  the  "logical  extension"  of  that
      business into the United Kingdom.  He submitted that  certain  answers
      provided at interview by the applicants, in particular  MB,  had  been
      misunderstood by the interviewing officer and/or  the  decision-maker,
      leading to irrational conclusions as regards reason 1.  The  interview
      evidence, if considered in the context of the  supporting  documentary
      evidence (in particular the business plan) simply  could  not,  it  is
      submitted, admit of  the  conclusion  that  the  applicants  were  not
      genuine.


  17. The second ground of challenge, which it is fair to say was pursued in
      greater  detail  at  the  hearing,  is  that   the   interviews   were
      procedurally unfair, which in turn  led  to  unlawful  decisions.   In
      essence, it was said that in the context of  these  cases  and  having
      regard to relevant authorities, the interviewing officers should have,
      but did not: (a) raise any relevant concerns with  the  applicants  at
      the  time;  (b)  probed  and/or  clarified  answers  provided  by  the
      applicants.  If concerns only came to light once  the  interviews  had
      been conducted, it was for the  respondents  to  ensure  that  a  fair
      procedure was put in place to permit the applicants a fair opportunity
      to respond to any adverse points likely to be taken against them.

  18. It was submitted that there was, at the very least,  ambiguity  as  to
      the answers provided by the  applicants  at  interview  and  as  these
      answers related to reasons 1-4.  Detailed submissions have  been  made
      in respect of all four reasons, and I will  deal  with  these  in  due
      course.  Mr Knafler emphasised the fact, as he  submitted  it  to  be,
      that no concerns were put to the applicants at interview.   The  cases
      of Anjum and Mushtaq provided support for  the  applicants'  cases  in
      terms of the general requirement for fairness of interviews and on the
      facts.

  19. A final point made was that the respondent had  failed  to  conduct  a
      proper  weighing  of  all  relevant  evidence  before   reaching   the
      conclusion  that  the  applicants  were  not  genuine   entrepreneurs.
      Reasons 1-4 related to interview answers only, without  any  reference
      to the business plan or other supporting documentation.

  20. For the  respondents,  Mr  Tabori  submitted  that  the  irrationality
      challenge was nothing more than an argument on the merits, and that it
      fell well short of meeting the relevant  threshold.   The  respondents
      were clearly entitled to take account of the interview answers and  to
      weigh these up when considering paragraph  245DB(f)  and  (h)  of  the
      Rules.  He submitted that there were clear discrepancies  and/or  gaps
      in knowledge arising from the interviews,  and  that  the  respondents
      were  entitled  to  take  these  into  account.   On  any  view,   the
      conclusions reached did not "fly in  the  teeth"  of  the  information
      provided by the applicants in response to questions.

  21. Mr Tabori responded in detail to the applicants' procedural unfairness
      argument, relying on the Detailed Grounds of Defence and his  skeleton
      argument.  The central thrust  of  his  submissions  was  as  follows.
      Procedural fairness is very much a context-dependent issue.   It  does
      not always require the respondent  to  clarify  and/or  probe  answers
      given by an interviewee.  In the present cases, questions  put  to  AT
      and MB were clear.  The applicants knew in advance that  they  had  to
      satisfy the respondents that they were genuine entrepreneurs and there
      is no question that they were in any way "ambushed", taken by surprise
      by the issues raised at interview, or left unaware of  the  "gist"  of
      the case that they had to  meet.   There  was  no  obligation  on  the
      respondents to provide the applicants a further opportunity to clarify
      or rectify the interview answers after the event.  Indeed,  Mr  Tabori
      submitted that any suggestion that there should  have  been  a  second
      interview or other form of follow-up prior to decisions being made  on
      the applications would lead to  a  form  of  "never-ending"  decision-
      making process.


  22. In respect of the  three  relevant  authorities,  there  were  obvious
      distinguishing factors, in particular that  the  applicants  in  these
      proceedings had been interviewed.  Further, unlike Mushtaq,  there  is
      no question that the applicants had held  against  them  matters  that
      were not fairly put at the interviews.  In contrast to the scenario in
      Anjum, the interview records did not disclose inflexibility or obscure
      questions.

  23. Turning to the four reasons relied on by the respondents when refusing
      the applications, Mr Tabori submitted that no unfairness had arisen in
      respect of any of them.  In reality, all that had  occurred  was  that
      the applicants gave discrepant answers and, particularly in respect of
      MB, displayed a material lack of knowledge.


  24. On the question of the deposit(s), Mr  Tabori  accepted  that  it  was
      fairly clear that MB's answer to question 10 was different to what  AT
      had said in reply to the same question.  On a proper reading  of  MB's
      answer, she had either avoided giving an answer as to how the �200,000
      had been accumulated because she did not know, or there was some other
      inexplicable reason.  Either way, the matter was  clearly  adverse  to
      her credibility.

  25. It was submitted that the answers provided by  the  applicants  as  to
      what their respective roles would be in the  business  were  at  least
      unclear and it was clearly rational for the respondents to  hold  this
      evidence against them.  If  the  applicants  had  been  given  another
      opportunity to "rectify" their answers, this would effectively  defeat
      the whole purpose of interviews and the efficiency  of  the  decision-
      making process.

  26. In respect of reason 3, there was an obvious discrepancy between  both
      applicants' answers as regards the expected year 1 net profit  of  the
      business.  In addition, both of their answers were discrepant with the
      figures set out in the business plan itself.  If  an  applicant  could
      simply rely on the contents of a  business  plan  at  interview  there
      would be no point in holding them.

  27. As to the breakdown of expenditure, Mr Tabori submitted  that  MB  had
      effectively tried to avoid the question.  There was no  unfairness  on
      the part of the interviewing officer  where  the  interviewee  was  in
      reality asking for the subject matter of the questions to be changed.

  28. In the course of Mr  Tabori's  submissions,  I  raised  the  issue  of
      whether, in this particular case or in general, there is a  danger  of
      interviews being conducted in a vacuum, so to  speak.  The  applicants
      put in a good deal of supporting documentary evidence and yet none  of
      this is referred to in the interview, despite a  number  of  questions
      relating to matters set out in, for example, the  business  plan.   Mr
      Tabori responded by submitting that there was no such "vacuum":  there
      was a clear link between the interview and the  documentary  evidence.
      Interviews were an appropriate means of testing the knowledge  of  the
      applicants vis-�-vis their applications and the  supporting  evidence.
      A lack of knowledge was relevant to the genuineness of their  proposed
      enterprise.

  29. In reply, Mr Knafler submitted that there was no meaningful connection
      between the interview  and  the  business  plan.   The  interview  had
      effectively been a memory test.  On the  deposits  issue,  Mr  Knafler
      took  me  back  to  question  10  of  both  the  interviews  and   the
      Administrative Review decision in AT's case.  Reason 1 related  to  an
      alleged discrepancy in the evidence  of  AT  and  MB  as  to  how  the
      �100,000 was deposited, not in respect  of  the  accumulation  of  the
      �200,000 investment fund.  This was contrary to Mr Tabori's submission
      and it  indicated  that  either  the  question  or  the  answers  were
      ambiguous; clarification had been required prior to an  adverse  point
      been taken against the applicants.

  30. During submissions I raised with Counsel the decision of  Saini  J  in
      Karagul [2019] EWHC 3208 (Admin).  My provisional view was  that  this
      case might have some relevance to  the  present.   I  invited  written
      submissions from both parties within a set timeframe.  I'm grateful to
      Counsel for providing their submissions expeditiously.

CONCLUSIONS

  31. Although the first ground put forward by the applicants is that of  an
      irrationality challenge,  I  propose  to  begin  with  the  procedural
      unfairness argument.  I do so because I have  reached  the  conclusion
      that there was procedural unfairness in the decision-making process in
      these cases, with particular reference to the interviews conducted  on
      17 May 2018 and the adverse inferences drawn therefrom.


  32. In setting out my reasons for this conclusion I will need  to  examine
      in some detail reasons 1-4 and the relevant aspects of  the  interview
      records.  However, before turning to these issues, it  is  appropriate
      to identify certain matters arising from the authorities  to  which  I
      have been referred.

The authorities

  33. The judgment of the Court of Appeal in  Balajigari  is  by  now  well-
      known.  There are obvious distinctions on the facts,  not  least  that
      the claimants had not been afforded the opportunity  of  attending  an
      interview prior to  a  decision  being  made  on  their  applications.
      However, the Court, with reference to previous authorities, emphasised
      the following (see paragraphs 45 - 55):

              i.  the  requirements  of  procedural  fairness  are  context-
                 specific;


             ii. fairness will "very often" require  a  person  who  may  be
                 adversely affected by a decision to have an opportunity  to
                 make representations before that decision is made;


            iii. fairness also "very often" require that  the  applicant  is
                 informed of the "gist" of the case which he has to answer;


             iv. the  opportunity  to  address  potential  concerns  may  be
                 provided through interview or by "some appropriate means";


              v. the seriousness of the effect of a negative  decision  (for
                 example, that an individual had  acted  dishonestly)  might
                 have a bearing on  the  requirements  necessary  to  ensure
                 fairness.

  34. Anjum concerned an applicant who had been refused entry clearance as a
      Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  In light of answers given at interview, the  ECO
      had concluded that he was  not  a  genuine  entrepreneur.   The  Upper
      Tribunal held  that,  on  analysis,  the  requirements  of  procedural
      fairness had not been  complied  with  and  that  the  decision  under
      challenge should be quashed.  Paragraph (ii) of the judicial  headnote
      to Anjum reads as follows:


           "An immigration interview may be unfair, thereby  rendering  the
           resulting  decision  unlawful,   where   inflexible   structural
           adherence  to  prepared  questions  excludes   the   spontaneity
           necessary to repeat or clarify obscure questions and/or to probe
           or elucidate answers given."


  35. Two points may be noted from the body of  the  decision.   First,  the
      questions and answers of the interview in that case had not been  read
      back to the applicant.  It would appear as though the same is true  in
      these proceedings.  However, in contrast to  Anjum,  AT  and  MB  were
      invited at the end of the interview to make any additional comments on
      what had been said.  Both declined the offer.

  36. The second point arises from paragraphs 17 and 22 of the decision.  At
      paragraph 17, the former President stated:

           "One striking feature of the interview record is that the
           Applicant was not asked any questions about the content of his
           Business Plan.  Nor did the interviewing ECO attempt to
           correlate any of the Applicant's replies to the latter.
           Furthermore, this exercise was not attempted in the ensuing
           refusal decision, subsequent affirmation thereof or the response
           to the PAP letter."
                       (Emphasis in the original)

  37. In concluding that the procedural unfairness challenge was made out in
      that case, McCloskey J noted at paragraph 22 that:


           "The single enduring reason for the refusal of  the  Applicant's
           Tier 1 application was based on a series  of  interview  answers
           which on  any  reasonable  and  fair  showing  demanded  further
           probing and  clarification,  together  with  a  linkage  to  the
           Business Plan..."

  38. Mushtaq involved an applicant who had been refused entry clearance  as
      a student.  Again based on interview answers, the ECO  concluded  that
      Mr Mushtaq was not a genuine applicant.  The  approach  taken  at  the
      interview was deemed  to  be  unfair  and  a  number  of  the  adverse
      conclusions reached were irrational.  Paragraph (ii) of  the  judicial
      headnote states:


           "ECO interviews serve the  basic  twofold  purpose  of  enabling
           applications to be probed and investigated and,  simultaneously,
           giving  the  applicant  a  fair  opportunity   to   respond   to
           potentially adverse matters.  The ensuring decision must  accord
           with the principles of procedural fairness."


  39. The concluding observation made by McCloskey J in paragraph 19 of that
      decision reads as follows:


           "The choice of questions and words in  ECO  interviews  requires
           care and planning.   Ambiguous  words  and  phrases  are  to  be
           avoided.  Furthermore, fairness  will  often  require  that  the
           interviewer invite the subject to clarify or expand an answer or
           probe a response.  These simple mechanisms will also  illuminate
           the court's assessment of whether any ensuing  adverse  decision
           was preordained.  The nationals  of  impoverished  and  deprived
           countries who have  invested  large  sums  of  money  and  whose
           admission to the United Kingdom as lawful if  they  satisfy  the
           requirements of the relevant legal rules  are  deserving  of  no
           less."


  40. Finally, there is a decision of Karagul.  Saini J  was  there  dealing
      with a number of linked cases all of which concerned Turkish  citizens
      who had applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as business-
      persons.  This case bears relevance  to  the  present  proceedings  in
      respect of the second issue identified at paragraph 5, namely  whether
      the decisions under challenge breached the requirements of fairness in
      the context of assertions by the respondent that  the  applicants  did
      not hold a "genuine intention" or  "genuine  wish"  to  set  up  their
      respective businesses.

  41. Having referred to the authorities analysed by the Court of Appeal  in
      Balajigari  and  that  judgment  itself,  Saini  J  sets   out   three
      propositions at paragraph 103 which are to be derived from the general
      principle that public law decision-making must be  fair,  albeit  that
      the specific requirements for this may vary depending on context:

           "(1) Where a public authority exercising an administrative power
           to grant or refuse an application proposes to make a decision
           that the applicant for some right, benefit or status may have
           been dishonest in their application or has otherwise acted in
           bad faith (or disreputably) in relation to the application,
           common law fairness will generally require at least the
           following safeguards to be observed. Either the applicant is
           given a chance in a form of interview to address the claimed
           wrongdoing, or a form of written "minded to" process, should be
           followed which allows representations on the specific matter to
           be made prior to a final decision.


           (2) Further, a process of internal administrative review of an
           original negative decision which bars the applicant from
           submitting new evidence to rebut the finding of wrongdoing is
           highly likely to be unfair.


           (3) The need for these common law protections is particularly
           acute where there has been a decision by the legislature to
           remove an appeal on the merits to an independent and impartial
           tribunal."

The relevant principles applicable in the present cases

  42.  The  overarching  general  principles  relating   to   fairness   are
      uncontroversial.   Decision-making  in  immigration  cases   must   be
      conducted  fairly.   Precisely  what  fairness  requires  is  context-
      specific; it will vary depending on the nature of the  relevant  legal
      framework, the type of application,  and  the  nature  of  conclusions
      reached.  The requirements of fairness in any  given  case  cannot  be
      sacrificed for the sake of simple administrative convenience.  Whether
      the procedure adopted in a particular case is fair or not is a  matter
      for the Tribunal or Court.


  43. I now set out the context in which the fairness of the decision-making
      in the present cases falls to be assessed.  The relevant matters  fall
      into two categories: the more general and the more case-specific.


  44.  Beginning  with  the  more  general.   First,  those  who  have  made
      applications for entry clearance (and for that matter leave to remain)
      as Tier 1 Entrepreneurs or in a number of other categories, will  have
      paid the United Kingdom government a good deal of money to do so.   In
      many cases, they will also have incurred a lot of time and expense in,
      for example,  engaging  legal  representation,  accumulating  relevant
      evidence, and attempting to arrange their affairs in order to try  and
      meet the strict criteria under the Rules.  Whether  or  not  countries
      from which applicants originate should be described  as  "impoverished
      and deprived", in my view all applicants are deserving of careful  and
      fair consideration of their cases (see Mushtaq, at paragraph 19).

  45. Second, whilst there  is  undoubtedly  a  strong  public  interest  in
      preventing non-genuine applicants from entering or remaining in United
      Kingdom, there is surely a corollary to this,  namely  that  there  is
      real  benefit  to  the  economy  of  the  United  Kingdom  if  genuine
      entrepreneurs are permitted to pursue their plans in this country.

  46. Third, I respectfully agree with the view of Saini J in  Karagul  that
      an allegation that  an  applicant  is  not  "genuine"  in  making  and
      pursuing their application is a serious matter.  I accept that  it  is
      not the same as an out-and-out allegation of dishonesty such as  would
      engage the provisions of Part 9 of  the  Rules  (general  grounds  for
      refusal).  However, the  term  "genuine"  as  defined  in  the  Oxford
      English  Dictionary  (3rd  Edition)  denotes  something  "having   the
      character  or  origin  represented"  and  being   "real,   true,   not
      counterfeit, unfeigned".  A conclusion that an individual has made  an
      application  with  a  non-genuine  intent  inevitably   involves   the
      assertion that they  have  acted  disreputably  and  with  a  lack  of
      integrity.  In my view,   Saini  J's  reasoning  in   Karagul  in  the
      context of the Rules in that case can properly be read across  to  the
      context of paragraph 245DB(f) and (h). The "genuineness" test  arising
      under paragraph 245DB(f) and (h) will, if the  conclusion  reached  is
      adverse to the individual, amount to a  serious  imputation  of  their
      character and conduct.  To this extent, I disagree  with  Mr  Tabori's
      argument at paragraph 4 of his  post-hearing  submissions  that  there
      should be no doubling-up of honesty requirements in which matters akin
      to general grounds for refusal are inserted into paragraph 245DB.   In
      addition, whilst Mr Tabori is correct to point out  that  the  refusal
      decisions in  the  present  cases  referred  to  the  credibility  and
      viability of aspects of the  applicants'  applications,  the  refusals
      also  said  that  the  decision-maker  was  not  satisfied  that  they
      "genuinely intended" to invest requisite funds.  Finally,  the  entire
      purpose of paragraph 245DB(f) is predicated on a genuineness test.


  47. Mr Tabori's post-hearing submissions seek to distinguish Karagul  from
      the  present  cases  on  a  number  of  grounds.   There  are  factual
      differences, not least that Saini J was considering a different aspect
      of the Rules (those relating to the so-called  Ankara  Agreement)  and
      the absence of an interview as part of  the  decision-making  process.
      However, the more general points that I have highlighted and relied on
      do not depend upon precise factual mirroring.


  48. Fourth, the "genuineness" criterion,  whilst  clearly  stated  in  the
      Rules, is in my view a broad concept, much like that of "character" in
      respect of application for naturalisation as a British citizen.  It is
      one thing for the applicant to know in advance that  they  must  prove
      that they are indeed a "genuine" entrepreneur and to have in mind  the
      criteria under paragraph 245DB(f) and (h) as a guide.  It  is  another
      to be given  an  opportunity  to  address  potential  concerns  as  to
      particular aspects of the genuineness test arising from evidence  they
      have provided.  In this regard I do not accept the suggestion  by  the
      respondents that individuals such as the applicants  will  necessarily
      know the gist of the case which they have to meet.  Whilst they should
      be aware of the criteria set out in the Rules, that is  not  the  same
      thing as being able to address concerns arising from the evidence  (in
      whatever form) provided in order to try and meet those  criteria  (see
      Balajigari at paragraph 48).  Further, I do not accept any  suggestion
      that  provided  questions  are  clear,  there  is  no  need  for   the
      interviewer to clarify and/probe  the  resulting  answers.   Again,  I
      emphasise the importance of the case-specific context.  What  fairness
      requires will depend on the particular case.  It may be,  for  example
      that a clear question is met with an  answer  that  should  raise  the
      possibility that the interviewee has simply misunderstood, or that the
      response specifically refers to supporting documentary  evidence  that
      may, potentially, need to be examined and clarification and/or probing
      undertaken by way of additional questions.

  49. Fifth, Mr Tabori's written and oral submissions  forcefully  made  the
      point that affording interviewees a second opportunity to  respond  to
      concerns from an interview would: (a) simply  allow  an  applicant  to
      fill in the gaps in their evidence; (b) would effectively  defeat  the
      point of holding  interview  in  the  first  place;  (c)  prevent  the
      respondent from properly testing the genuineness  of  an  application;
      and  (d)  would  represent  a  marked  departure  from  the   existing
      parameters of the requirements of fairness.

  50. There is merit in certain aspects  of  these  submissions.   Decision-
      making processes cannot go on forever: there  could  be  a  danger  of
      applicants seeking one further opportunity after another in  order  to
      put forward additional information.  Opportunities to address concerns
      arising from an interview could also be seen as defeating the  purpose
      of that  initial  step:  applicants  may  simply  supply  the  missing
      information or explain away any discrepancies.

  51. However, when seen through the context-specific prism of what fairness
      requires in any given case, I  conclude  that  the  objections  raised
      ultimately fall away.  The principal reason for this is that, in light
      of the more general contextual matters that I have set out previously,
      the  interview  itself  and  the  requirements  of  fairness  relating
      thereto, takes on an increased significance.  It is at this stage that
      particular care has to be taken in order to, for example:  ensure  the
      clarity of questions; potentially clarify and/or probe  answers  given
      (whether or not the question itself is clear); have regard to relevant
      documentary evidence when asking questions  and/or  clarifying  and/or
      probing answers.  Thus, it  may  be  that  longer  and  more  detailed
      interviews are,  depending  very  much  on  the  facts  of  the  case,
      necessary in order to ensure procedural fairness  without  potentially
      resorting to post-interview opportunities to address concerns before a
      decision  is  taken  on  the  application.   Alternatively,  if  post-
      interview information is provided, the  respondent  would  plainly  be
      entitled, when considering  this,  to  have  regard  to  any  apparent
      deficiencies in the evidence provided at  the  interview  itself  when
      determining  the  credibility,  viability,  and  genuineness   of   an
      application.  That, it seems to me, is consistent with what  was  said
      by Martin Spencer J in Khan (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5))
      [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC), which was relied on by Saini  J  in  Karagul.
      Paragraph (ii) of the judicial headnote to Khan states:


           "Where an Applicant has presented evidence to show that, despite
           the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but only
           careless, then the Secretary of State must  decide  whether  the
           explanation evidence is sufficient, in her view, to displace the
           prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty"


  52. The further evidence referred to by Martin Spencer  J  in  Khan  would
      have been provided following an assertion by the respondent  that  the
      individual had acted dishonestly (or at least that the respondent  was
      minded to draw that conclusion).  Thus, the gist of the  adverse  case
      against the individual had been put  and  an  opportunity  to  respond
      provided.


  53. Sixth, returning to the proposition set out by Saini  J,  the  limited
      nature of Administrative Review and the absence of an  appeal  on  the
      merits to a tribunal are also relevant factors not simply  in  respect
      of the need for fairness, but also in  terms  of  what  fairness  will
      require   in   cases   subject   to   restricted   remedial   avenues.
      Notwithstanding the distinguishability of Karagul on the facts, it  is
      the case that unsuccessful Tier 1 Entrepreneur applicants are  subject
      to the same limited remedial regime.

  54. The more fact-specific contextual matters  that  I  now  turn  to  are
      uncontroversial in the sense that  they  have  been  either  expressly
      accepted by the respondents or are at least undisputed.


  55. First, AT was already an established businessman  who  was  running  a
      profitable enterprise in the  field  of  educational  consultancy  for
      prospective students to pursue courses in the United Kingdom.

  56. Second, on the face of it, the proposed United Kingdom-based  business
      on which the applications were predicated was a logical  extension  of
      the existing business.

  57. Third, whilst plainly in no way decisive of  the  genuineness  of  the
      applications, the  respondents  were  satisfied  as  to  the  relevant
      attributes under Appendices A-C of the Rules, including access to  the
      requisite funds and the fact that these were disposable in the  United
      Kingdom.


  58. Fourth, and flowing from the above,  the  applicants  had  provided  a
      significant  amount  of  documentary  evidence  including  a  detailed
      business plan.

  59. With the contextual landscape in mind, I now turn to analyse the  four
      reasons given by the respondents for refusing the applications.

Reason 1: the deposit(s)


  60. Questions 7-10 of AT's interview read as follows  (I  have  italicised
      the answers for ease of reading):


           "7. How much money do you have to invest in the UK?
           We have �200,000 as per the Immigration Rules and  the  business
           plan we wrote


           8.  Whose account is this money (�200,000) in?
           I have �100,000 in my current account in the  UK  and  [MB]  has
           �100,000 in her personal account in Kuwait


           9.  How long has this money been held for in this account?
           Over �200,000 it was held in [MB's] account for 6 months


           10.  Where did this money originate from?
           This money is from some savings and she has another  company  in
           Germany and I have transferred �45,000 but we  did  not  mention
           this.
           Additional questions:-
           If deposited, was this in a single deposit or multiple deposits?
           It was multiple deposits as we were trying to prepare  for  this
           from last year and the exchange rate was different so we had  to
           do multiple deposits.
           What date was this deposited into the account?
           I am not sure as I didn't have access  to  deposit  but  I  have
           access to use the funds for investment.
           How much was deposited (try to obtain an exact amount)  on  each
           day?
           No answer recorded."

  61. Questions 7-10 of MB's interview record read as follows:


           "7.  How much money do you have to invest in the UK?
           �200k


           8.  Whose account is this money (�200,000) in?
           It was my bank account and I asked the solicitor and said that I
           should have �100k in my bank account and  another  �100k  in  my
           partner's bank account.
           Was the money originally yours?
           Yes it's all my money the �200k


           9.  How long has this money been held for in this account?
           Since I started thinking of investing in the UK and it's been in
           the bank for more than 9 months and I have bank  statement  that
           shows the money has been in the bank for more than 6 months.


           10.  Where did this money originate from?
           From my work money as I don't need it and save it straight  away
           and my husband pays for all my expenses etc and I save  it  plus
           my husband's company gave me the money.  Also we are partners in
           a company in Germany called Almasreyah  International  and  it's
           for importing and exporting  shisha  accessories.   And  I  have
           profits from...
           Additional questions:-
           If deposited, was this in a single deposit or multiple deposits?
           I sent the papers to the Home Office in the UK.
           What date was this deposited into the account?
           I don't remember the date it was around 9 months ago.
           How much was deposited (try to obtain an exact amount)  on  each
           day?
           The �200k was in my bank account and I transferred �100k  to  my
           partner on one deposit."


  62. It will be recalled that reason 1 was  based  on  the  assertion  that
      there was a material discrepancy in the applicants' interview evidence
      as to whether the �100,000 to be contributed by AT had been  deposited
      into his account in a single deposit or multiple deposits.   Reason  1
      did not relate to the �200,000 investment fund as a whole.


  63. Mr Knafler's basic submission is that, on  a  proper  reading  of  the
      interview answers, the phrase "this money" appearing repeatedly in the
      relevant questions related to the  �200,000  fund,  not  the  �100,000
      contribution by AT, and it was in relation to the former that  AT  was
      providing  information.   In  other  words,  the  "multiple  deposits"
      referred to the accumulation of the �200,000 fund, not the  manner  by
      which the �100,000 was transferred into AT's  account.   In  contrast,
      the respondents assert that there is a discrepancy in the evidence.

  64. I conclude that the proper analysis of reason 1 is that put forward by
      Mr Knafler.  That reason plainly does  not  relate  to  any  perceived
      discrepancy as to the �200,000 investment  fund,  but  solely  to  the
      issue of the �100,000 contribution.  Any apparent  vagueness  in  MB's
      evidence as to the accumulation of the �200,000 is  beside  the  point
      because it was not relied on by the  decision-maker.   In  any  event,
      given what MB did in fact say in response to  question  10  concerning
      what was clearly an assertion  that  the  money  came  from  different
      sources, fairness would have required specific questions on the  issue
      of how the funds from the sources were deposited into her account.

  65. Coming back to what reason 1 actually says, and given  the  contextual
      factors I have set out previously and the answers provided by  AT  and
      MB, I conclude that, for the following reasons,  this  aspect  of  the
      applicants' fairness challenge is made out.

  66. First, whilst as a whole the questions  put  in  the  interviews  were
      clear, it is  apparent  from  the  record  of  each,  and  indeed  the
      differing interpretations placed on the same material  by  Counsel  at
      the hearing (which, I am bound to say, also left me with a  degree  of
      judicial head-scratching, as it were), that the phrase "this money" as
      used in question 8 related specifically to the �200,000  (this  figure
      is stated  in  parenthesis  immediately  after  the  phrase).   Unlike
      question 8, question 10 does  not  include  a  specific  reference  to
      �200,000.  This, in my view, is unfortunate: it opened  up  scope  for
      misunderstanding by the interviewing officers  and/or  (which  is  the
      relevant point here) the applicants.

  67. Second, on what I consider to be a fair and reasonable reading of AT's
      answers, he was referring to the �200,000 when stating that there  had
      been "multiple deposits".  At no stage did he state in terms that such
      deposits related to the �100,000.  MB related the first  part  of  her
      answer to question  10  to  the  different  sources  of  the  �200,000
      investment fund, but in response to the third additional question,  MB
      then specifically stated  that  the  �100,000  contribution  had  been
      transferred to AT in a single deposit.

  68. Third, in light of the  above,  we  have  a  situation  in  which  the
      applicants  have  provided  answers  based   upon   their   particular
      understanding of questions put. AT's  interpretation  of  question  10
      was, on my reading of the phrase "this money" and in  the  absence  of
      any clarification from the interviewing officer, entirely  legitimate:
      his response related to the �200,000 and not to the  transfer  of  the
      �100,000.  On the face of the record, MB's responses to questions 8-10
      indicate that she had both the �200,000 and the  �100,000  figures  in
      mind.

  69.  What  this  cried  out  for  in  respect  of  both  interviews   were
      clarificatory questions on what was, in the event, a  material  issue.
      I have indicated my concern over the ambiguity in  the  usage  of  the
      phrase "this money" in the relevant questions.  Leaving  this  to  one
      side, however, the nature of the answers themselves required follow-up
      questions as a matter of fairness in order to ensure  that:  (a)  each
      applicant had in fact properly understood the question put; and/or (b)
      that the interviewing officer  had  properly  understood  the  answers
      provided; and/or (c) that any potential concern that either  applicant
      had deliberately  sought  to  avoid  answering  the  question  or  was
      displaying a distinct lack of reasonable knowledge,  could  have  been
      put to them at that  stage  in  the  decision-making  process  (it  is
      scenarios (b) and (c) that are material  in  these  proceedings).   My
      conclusion does not involve the introduction of any novel  or  onerous
      requirement on the respondent part: it is  simply  an  application  of
      established principles of fairness in the context of these cases.

  70. It is manifestly the case that no clarification was sought from either
      applicant at the interview (or indeed thereafter).

  71. Fourth, two consequences flow from the above.   The  failure  to  have
      sought any clarification of the applicants' answers to question 10  of
      their respective interviews was procedurally unfair, having regard  to
      all  contextual  factors  that  I  have  identified  earlier  in  this
      decision.   This  procedural   unfairness   has   then   resulted   in
      irrationality  in  respect  of  reason  1.   On  my  analysis  of  the
      applicants'  responses  to  questions  8-10  there   simply   was   no
      discrepancy in their respective answers.  AT provided  information  on
      the accumulation of the �200,000 and said nothing about the depositing
      of  �100,000  into  his  account,  whereas  MB  (after   having   made
      generalised reference to various sources of  that  fund)  specifically
      referred to a single deposit of the �100,000.  Reason 1 is  predicated
      on the false basis that both applicants provided specific  answers  in
      relation to the depositing of the �100,000.

  72. Reason 1 is therefore unsustainable.

Reason 2: the roles in the business


  73. Question 21 of AT's interview read as follows:


           "21. What will your role be in the UK business?
           I will be  managing  the  Daily  operations  and  providing  the
           marketing activities and Sales enquiries."


  74. MB's answer to the same question was as follows:


           "21.  I will be the director - my partner will be a director  to
           he will be for the financial side of the business."


  75. Reason 2 states that these answers indicated that the  applicants  had
      not agreed or known their intended roles, and that this undermined the
      viability and credibility of the business plan  and  market  research,
      which in turn went to the issue of genuineness.  The particular  focus
      was on the evidence relating to AT's role.


  76. The applicants submit that when this evidence is read in  the  context
      of the business  plan  in  particular,  there  was  no  inconsistency.
      Alternatively, there was at least ambiguity in the  interview  answers
      which  required  clarification  and/or  probing.   In   essence,   the
      respondents' position is that AT's response was entirely nebulous, and
      that MB was specific.   There  was  an  obvious  discrepancy  and  the
      respondents were entitled to take this into account.  Fairness did not
      require an opportunity for the applicants to rectify  their  interview
      answers: the interviews were the opportunity to put  forward  a  clear
      account of the proposed business venture.

  77. I accept that the term  "daily  operations"  is  wide-ranging  in  its
      potential scope.  As a matter of common sense,  it  could  incorporate
      the financial operations of a business and a question might be  raised
      as to why AT did not state in terms that he was to be in charge of the
      financial side of things.  Having said that, and at risk of  repeating
      myself,  context  is  all.   Here,  AT's  answer   was   not   clearly
      inconsistent with him being in charge of financial matters.   Nor  was
      MB's answer necessarily inconsistent with what her partner  had  said.
      Further, the respondent (in the person of  the  interviewing  officer)
      had reviewed the documentary evidence in advance of the interview  (it
      is not clear whether  this  evidence  was  present  at  the  interview
      itself).  An obviously important element  of  that  evidence  was  the
      business plan.  Page 22 of that plan (page 118 of the judicial  review
      bundle) describes AT as the "Operations Director".  On  the  following
      page, AT's "Key Responsibilities" are set out as follows:

           "[AT] as Operations Director will lead the commercial management
           of the business including:
            - Direction of all areas of revenues
            - Development of Sales and Marketing strategies
            - Managing the operations team (sales and admissions)"

  78. The significance of business plans was highlighted by McCloskey  J  in
      Anjum (see paragraphs 36 and 37, above).  If there  had  been  even  a
      relatively cursory consideration of the business plan in  the  present
      cases, it would have been apparent that what AT had said  in  response
      to question 21 was  entirely  consistent  with  the  plan.   The  same
      applies to MB's answer.


  79. There was no  attempt  to  correlate  the  interview  answers  to  the
      business plan either at interview, post-interview, or indeed when  the
      refusal decisions themselves were drafted.  In my view, this is not  a
      case in which the interviewing officers were  required  to  engage  in
      unduly speculative or disproportionate investigation of  the  body  of
      evidence as a whole.  Rather,  in  respect  of  what  the  respondents
      described as a "nebulous" answer from AT, fairness required a  follow-
      up question, whether with specific reference to the business  plan  or
      simply to clarify what was  meant  by  "daily  operations".   As  with
      reason  1,  my  conclusion  is  nothing  more  than   application   of
      established principles of fairness applied to  the  context  of  these
      cases.

  80. The failure of the respondent at any stage (but in particular  at  the
      interviews)  to  seek  clarification  and/or  probe  and/or  make  any
      reference  to  the  business  plan  in  respect  of  the   roles   was
      procedurally unfair.

  81. Reason 2 is also unsustainable.

Reason 3: net profit in year 1


  82. I shall deal with this point briefly.  Question 30 of  the  interviews
      and the answers provided thereto were entirely clear.  As regards AT :


           "Net profit for year 1?
           I think we will break even for the first year."

  83. In response to the same question, MB replied, "It's around �8k".


  84. In context, I conclude that whilst the issue  could  potentially  have
      been explored further, fairness  did  not  require  there  to  be  any
      clarification or probing in respect of the  answers  provided.   There
      was no  apparent  ambiguity.   Further,  the  business  plan  included
      projections that differed  from  the  answers  provided  by  both  the
      applicants.

  85. In respect of reason 3, the procedural unfairness challenge fails.

Reason 4: breakdown of expenditure


  86. In response to question  20  in  which  he  was  asked  to  provide  a
      breakdown of what the �200,000 would be used for, AT replied:


           "It will be used for overhead costs like  Office  Rent  �30,000-
           �34,000, Direct costs  like  wages  around  �40,000-�44,000  the
           monthly  costs  for  accounts  and  legal  fees  Around  �20,000
           including Marketing activities that will be  paid  twice  during
           the high season for the first year."


  87. In her answer to the same question, MB said:


           "As soon as we arrive I will start  the  business  with  �14,200
           including the �500 for  training,  �500  advertising,  �30k  for
           renting approximately I can't remember the rest of the numbers.
           Solicitor fees - around �2k I can't remember  exactly  as  there
           are many numbers.  But I know everything on papers now  I  can't
           remember the numbers written on the papers.
           I can't remember the numbers.  My partner will know more  as  he
           is more responsible into the financial side.   I  don't  have  a
           memory  to  remember  the  numbers.   We  agreed  he   will   be
           responsible for the financial side of the business."


  88. I remind myself of what reason 4 actually says.  Its first limb states
      that MB's evidence on what role AT was to take  in  the  business  was
      inconsistent with what he had said.  For reasons set out  above,  that
      aspect of the respondents' decision is flawed by virtue of  procedural
      unfairness.


  89. The remaining aspect of reason 4 is that it was not  "credible  for  a
      genuine entrepreneurial team  that  each  team  member  would  not  be
      familiar with how the funds would be invested in their business."   Mr
      Tabori's submission was that an applicant such as MB could not  simply
      avoid answering questions properly put to them,  and  that  procedural
      fairness did not require her to be given the  opportunity  to  provide
      further and better answers in any follow-up process.

  90. I conclude that there are two  problems  with  the  fairness  of  this
      aspect of the decision-making, each of which is sufficient  to  render
      what is  left  of  reason  4  unsustainable.   First,  as  highlighted
      previously, the business plan made it very clear that it  was  AT  who
      was to be in charge of the  commercial  management  of  the  business,
      including all areas of revenues.  The plan and its content  were  part
      and parcel of the case-specific context in which the interview  needed
      to be conducted and the subsequent decision-making had to have  regard
      to.  However, there was no correlation between the business  plan  and
      MB's interview answers.  Second, in my view an interview should not be
      considered a memory test.  They serve the "basic  twofold  purpose  of
      enabling   applications   to   be   probed   and   investigated   and,
      simultaneously, giving the applicant a fair opportunity to respond  to
      potentially adverse matters." (see Mushtaq).  In  the  present  cases,
      the interviewing officer knew, or should have known, that  it  was  AT
      who was to have responsibility for the revenues of the  business.   In
      this context, fairness required  either  follow-up  questions  at  the
      interview, or at least that MB be given an opportunity to  respond  to
      any concern arising from her answer that she could not remember all of
      the numbers.  In saying this, I note that the specific numbers she did
      in fact provide are consistent with what is said in the business  plan
      (see page 125 of the judicial review bundle).  This is another example
      of a failure to seemingly have any specific regard to that  plan  when
      questioning the  applicants,  or  indeed  when  drafting  the  refusal
      decisions.


  91. In conclusion, reason 4 is unsustainable.


Summary

  92. In light of my conclusions that three of the four reasons put  forward
      by the respondents' refusing the applicants' applications are  flawed,
      I am of the view that the decisions as a whole cannot stand.  This  is
      not a situation in which it can properly be said that  it  is  "highly
      likely" that the outcome  for  the  applicants  would  not  have  been
      substantially different if the procedural unfairness had not  occurred
      (see section 15(5A) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007
      and section 31(2A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981).  My  conclusion  on
      this would be the same even if it were the case that  only  reasons  1
      and 2 were flawed.  The genuineness test under paragraph 245DB(f)  and
      (h) of the Rules involves a global assessment of the evidence.  It  is
      of a different character to a straightforward consideration of whether
      an applicant satisfies narrow, mandatory criterion under the  relevant
      Rule (such as the awarding of points).  If a  significant  constituent
      part of the reasoning underpinning a refusal is  unsustainable,  there
      is a strong possibility that the overall assessment that an  applicant
      is not a genuine entrepreneur will have been infected by  the  errors.
      At the very least, it cannot be said  that,  absent  the  errors,  the
      outcome would be "highly likely" to be essentially the same.




CONCLUSIONS ON THE IRRATIONLITY CHALLENGE


  93. As set out  in  paragraph  71,  above,  one  specific  aspect  of  the
      rationality challenge has been made out in respect of reason 1.


  94.  In  respect  of  the  other  three  reasons,  absent  the  procedural
      unfairness which I have concluded occurred in respect of two of  them,
      the high threshold irrationality  challenge  has  not  been  made  out
      (although that failure is only by a narrow margin in respect of reason
      2).   The  adverse  points  taken  against  the  applicants  were  not
      Wednesbury unreasonable.

  95. The partial success of the rationality challenge further  supports  my
      conclusions on the procedural unfairness issue, but is  in  no  way  a
      necessary element of my ultimate decision that these applications  for
      judicial review must be granted.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

       Notification of appeal rights


      A decision by the Upper  Tribunal  on  an  application  for  judicial
      review is a decision that disposes of proceedings.


       A party may appeal against such a decision to the Court of Appeal on
      a question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply
      to the Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the
      decision is given. If no  application  is  made,  the  Tribunal  must
      nonetheless consider  at  the  hearing  whether  to  give  or  refuse
      permission to appeal (rule 44(4B) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008).


      If  the  Tribunal  refuses  permission,  either  in  response  to  an
      application or by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the  party  wishing  to
      appeal can apply for permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This
      must be done by filing an appellant's notice with the  Civil  Appeals
      Office of the Court  of  Appeal  within  28  days  of  the  date  the
      Tribunal's decision on permission to appeal was sent (Civil Procedure
      Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
