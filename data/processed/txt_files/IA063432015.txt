Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr C Jacobs, counsel, instructed by Kilby Jones
                    Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Albania, born on 15 April 1984.


      The background to the appeal


   2. The appellant claimed to have entered the UK on 1 December 2013.


   3. On 15 December 2014 he was prevented from holding a marriage  ceremony
      with Ms Pascaru. He was detained by  immigration  officers  during  an
      enforcement visit to the register office.


   4. On 22 December 2014 he applied for a residence card  as  an  unmarried
      partner. It was contended that he had been engaged in a  sham  wedding
      ceremony with Ms Pascaru.


   5. On 19 January 2015, the appellant again applied for a  residence  card
      as an unmarried partner of Ms Pascaru. That application was refused on
      5 February 2015. An appeal was lodged.  He  then  provided  a  British
      marriage certificate  claiming  to  be  married  to  Ms  Pascaru.  The
      respondent reconsidered his application.


   6. The appellant and  Ms  Pascaru  were  invited  to  attend  a  marriage
      interview which took place on 22 September 2015. It was contended that
      there were a number of  inconsistent  and  conflicting  answers  given
      during that interview.


   7. The respondent  accordingly  stated  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
      convenience in order to facilitate leave to remain in the UK.


   8. The First-tier Tribunal upheld the respondent's refusal in a  decision
      promulgated on 4 January 2016.


   9. On 22 October 2016 the Upper Tribunal held that the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of  law
      and was set aside:  The Judge did not take into account  corroborating
      documentary evidence tending to support the assertion that  there  had
      been cohabitation together.    His  finding  that  Ms  Pascaru's  bank
      statement showed that she probably used the account as would a  single
      person was not supported by any reasoning. The fact that they may  not
      have had a joint bank account did not in itself militate  against  the
      assertion that they had been cohabiting at the  same  premises.  There
      was also evidence that joint bills and notices were sent  to  them  at
      the address where they claimed they cohabited.


  10. It was directed that the appeal would be heard afresh.  The  appellant
      was permitted to file updating evidence for the resumed hearing.


      Re-making the Decision


  11. I have had regard to the bundles of evidence, A1, A2 and  A3  produced
      by the appellant at the hearing. The appellant also  produced  further
      documentary evidence including a rent book  showing  that  he  and  Ms
      Pascaru, his sponsor, have been paying ï¿½500 a month from October  2014
      until November 2016. The date of the tenancy is 10 October 2014.


  12. The appellant attended the hearing and  gave  evidence.  He  gave  his
      address as [~ Walk].


  13. He adopted his witness statement at A1 pages 8-14,  which  was  before
      the First-tier Tribunal. However, it was not signed. At the hearing on
      14 December 2016 he signed  his  statement  subject  to  amending  the
      statement at paragraph 14, stating that the relationship  between  him
      and Nicoletta  had  become  serious  and  "we"  decided  to  look  for
      somewhere to live. At paragraph 15 the correct date is towards the end
      of November 2014, which is the date that he proposed to Nicoletta.


  14. He also produced and signed at the hearing a second witness  statement
      at A2, pages 116-7. He amended paragraph  6  of  that  statement:  His
      wife's mother was diagnosed with chronic liver failure two  weeks  ago
      and not "lung cancer" as asserted.


  15. The appellant stated that he was born on 15  April  1984  in  Tropoja,
      Albania. He is the husband of Nicoletta Alexandra Pascaru.


  16. He came to the UK on 1 December 2013, having entered illegally. He has
      remained here since. He and Nicoletta first met at a weekend party  in
      June 2014. They could both speak Italian and both lived in Gloucester.
      They got on well with each other. He told her that he had been in  the
      UK since 1 December 2013. She told him that she  came  here  in  April
      2014.


  17. They met up again two days later in the centre  of  Gloucester.  There
      was a mutual attraction. After  that  meeting,  they  saw  each  other
      regularly. She found employment in a car wash service in Cwnbran.


  18. With the passing of time he got to know her a lot better. They  mostly
      spoke to each other in Italian. She knew he  was  Albanian.  She  knew
      little about that country.


  19. He explained to her that he had no leave to remain here. She had  such
      "an inkling". She loved him and wanted him  to  be  lawfully  resident
      here.


  20. The relationship progressed steadily. They fell in love in due course.




  21. In October 2014 they began living together in a two bedroomed house at
      [~ Walk]. The tenancy agreement was signed a few weeks later.


  22. Towards the end of November 2014 he proposed to her.


  23. They contacted the registry office and made arrangements to  marry  in
      Pontepool on 15 December 2014. He had booked a restaurant to celebrate
      in Bristol.


  24. He, Nicoletta and their witnesses attended the registry  office  where
      he was arrested  and  detained  by  immigration  officers.  They  were
      interviewed by the officers. They asked Nicoletta  for  permission  to
      visit their home; she gave them  permission  at  the  time.  She  then
      accompanied the immigration officers to their home.


  25. He contends that they found clear evidence of  cohabitation  including
      photographs. The officers saw their clothing and  personal  belongings
      there. They apologised for the disruption  and  upset  that  had  been
      caused but they advised that they were detaining the appellant because
      he had been in the country illegally.


  26. He  then  made  an  application  for  a  residence  card  and  he  was
      subsequently released on bail.


  27. They got married on 25 February 2015 at the Torfaen  Registry  Office.
      They invited five people on this occasion as they  were  reluctant  to
      invite many people on account of the past bad experience. There was  a
      celebratory lunch afterwards in Newport.


  28. He refers to various parties organised at home on his birthday.  There
      were 12 guests invited including Nicoletta's brothers.


  29. They subsequently got married on  25  February  2015  at  the  Torfaen
      Register Office. They invited five people on  this  occasion  as  they
      were reluctant to invite many  people  on  account  of  the  past  bad
      experience. There was a celebratory lunch afterwards  in  Newport.  He
      referred to various parties organised at home on his  birthday.  There
      were twelve guests invited including Nicoleta's brothers.


  30. His feelings for Nicoleta remain strong. She loves  him  as  well.  He
      wishes to remain in the UK and live with his wife. He has not lived in
      Albania since 2013.


  31. He stated that Nicoleta went to Romania at the end of  September  2014
      and stayed there for ten days. She returned to the  UK  on  7  October
      2014. On 6 October 2014, Nicoleta left her sister  with  authority  to
      collect her passport. Her sister brought her passport when she came to
      visit them in November 2014. Nicoleta used her ID to come to the UK.


  32. It was wrongly recorded that she Nicoleta started  her  employment  in
      October 2014 when in fact she started on 3 November 2014. Her payslips
      correspond with her start date of employment.


  33. He produced and identified various original photographs set  out  from
      pages 45-150.  Some show their bedroom at the property. The  appellant
      and his wife are photographed in some together in the garden in  2015.
      There is another photograph of her sister and son who were visiting.


  34. Pages 33-36 contain documents relating to the appellant and  his  wife
      on the date of their marriage. These include photographs of the couple
      with their friends. The description of each such  photograph  produced
      is contained on the reverse side.


  35. In his supplementary statement at pages 116-117, he stated that he and
      his wife continue to live at their address at [~  Walk].  He  produced
      tenancy agreements confirming  this.  There  is  also  the  rent  book
      confirming regular rent payment; council tax bills in joint names from
      2014 to date and receipts confirming payment. He produced water  bills
      in joint names confirming joint financial commitments. The bills  from
      EE are addressed to his wife and the TV licence is addressed  to  him.
      These documents were sent to them at [~ Walk].


  36. He contended that his wife has been exercising Treaty  rights  in  the
      UK. From April 2016, until the  present,  she  has  been  working  for
      Bluerock Healthcare Ltd as a carer.  He  referred  to  a  contract  of
      employment and payslips in confirmation.


  37. They tried to open a joint account but were  unable  to  do  so  as  a
      result of a lack of identity documents on his part.


  38. Her mother was diagnosed with chronic liver failure two weeks ago. His
      wife's sister intended to give evidence but she has  to  be  near  her
      mother at this difficult time.


  39. He identified the documents to which he referred.


  40. He was detained on the first occasion for 52 days.


  41. After that they set another date for the wedding. Except  for  the  52
      days whilst he was in detention they have been together for  over  two
      years. They have lived together during that period.


  42. In cross examination, he  said  that  they  speak  to  each  other  in
      Italian. He speaks Italian fluently, as does his wife.


  43. They are living in a house with two bedrooms. There is also  a  living
      room and kitchen. They pay ï¿½500 a month by way of rental. They do  not
      share the property with anyone.


  44. He said that they had to get up at 5am in order to get a train to come
      to the hearing. He travelled from his town to  Paddington,  i.e.  from
      Cwmbran. Both he and his wife came together.


  45. He did not have a return ticket. He used  the  ticket  that  "you  put
      through the machine."


  46. He and his wife have not had holidays in the UK for financial reasons.
      Only his wife works.


  47. She now works  in  the  care  department  for  the  elderly  at  "Blue
      Heather." She last worked on Monday between 7am and 4pm (he  gave  his
      evidence on 14 December 2016, which was a Wednesday).


  48. The appellant said that he has not worked in the UK. He did not have a
      stable job in Albania. He finished  university.  He  studied  "economy
      degree." He  received  a  maths  and  computer  degree.  This  was  an
      "economics degree".


  49. He does not have any family apart from his wife  in  the  UK.  He  has
      family in Albania, namely his mother and father who are on their  own.
      His brother is in Greece. He has a sister in Albania and a  sister  in
      Germany. Accordingly he has one brother and two  sisters.  His  mother
      and father live in Tirana.


  50. His wife does not have family in the UK at the  moment.  Her  brothers
      were in Wales. One of her brothers is a witness at the hearing.


  51. His wife's mother is unwell. She was diagnosed about three weeks  ago.
      She has had to be in hospital. She is at a hospital called  Vasilu  in
      Romania. The hospital is in Vasilu. That is where her  mother  resides
      as well. She lives in Vasilu but not in the centre.


  52. His wife plans to visit her  mother.  He  wishes  for  her  to  go  by
      Christmas. She has not booked any travel in that respect, however.


  53. In re-examination he stated that she  works  for  Bluerock  Healthcare
      Ltd. He referred to photograph no. 39 showing him, his  wife  and  her
      brother, Marco, taken in 2015. There are also photographs of his  wife
      and her brother, Sorin. He is married and has twins.  That  photo  was
      taken in 2015. He identified various other  photographs  showing  them
      talking to his mother on Skype. There is also a photograph showing his
      brother and his wife in 2016, also on Skype.


  54. Nicoleta Alexandra Pascaru attended the hearing and gave evidence. She
      adopted her witness statement, as amended, at pages 8-14 of A1, signed
      and dated 14 December 2016.  At  page  15  there  is  a  copy  of  her
      passport. She amended paragraph 14 of her statement.  It  was  towards
      the end of November "2014" that her husband proposed to her.


  55. She gave essentially the same evidence as that given by the appellant.
      She referred to the occasion when immigration  officers  arrested  the
      appellant at the register office. They asked  her  for  permission  to
      visit their home. She went with them to the home. They found  evidence
      of their cohabitation including photographs  of  them  together.  They
      also saw their clothes and personal belongings.


  56. She stated that the immigration officer asked her at the time why  she
      did not reply "quickly" to her questions. She said that she was scared
      at the time. She stayed about one and  a  half  hours  with  her.  She
      needed time to reply. She also  identified  the  photographs  and  the
      descriptions written on them.


  57. She produced her payslips for the period 2014-2016. She also  produced
      a P60. Her current contract of employment does not have  her  address.
      There is a certificate produced of her attending a course.


  58. She also produced a medical letter  from  the  Emergency  Hospital  of
      Vasilui County referring to her mother who was seen in the  department
      on 21 November 2016. The diagnosis set out is "chronic liver failure".




  59. At page 138 there is a statement from her sister indicating  that  she
      cannot travel to England on 14 December 2016 as a  witness,  as  their
      mother is seriously ill and she needs to stay with her to  take  care.
      This was signed and dated 6 December 2016.


  60. Ms Pascaru stated that she visited her  husband  in  detention,  going
      every two weeks.


  61. She denies that theirs was not a  genuine  marriage.  They  have  been
      living together since December 2014. She referred  to  her  employment
      agreement with Bluerock at page 137, dated 29 March 2016. The  address
      given in the letter is that of the agency of  Bluerock.  That  is  the
      agency's postcode, namely LS16 5PR.  She was present for  training  in
      September 2016.  She said that she has never lived at that address.


  62. In cross examination, she said that she and her husband speak  Italian
      at  home.  They  live  in  a  two  bedroomed  house  which  is  rented
      accommodation. The amount of rent is  ï¿½500.  They  do  not  share  the
      property.


  63. They left at 5am to come to Court. They stopped  at  Paddington.  They
      travelled together. She gave her ticket to her husband who used it  to
      get through the barriers.


  64. They have only been to Cardiff together.


  65. She does agency work. The last day she worked was  on  Monday  between
      7am and 4pm.


  66. The appellant does not work. He worked in Albania in the  construction
      industry. He went to university. He studied "economy".  She  does  not
      know the university.


  67. Her husband does not have family members in the UK. He has  a  brother
      in Greece. She identified their names  as  well  as  the  siblings  in
      Albania and Germany.


  68. She does not have any family in the UK  at  present.  Her  mother  was
      diagnosed two weeks ago with her illness. She is no longer in hospital
      but left last week. She was in Vasilu Hospital. She lives  in  Vasilu,
      outside the town. She wants to visit her soon.


Submissions


  69. Mr Staunton submitted that the appeal turns on credibility. He  stated
      that bearing in mind the answers given there was "little he could  add
      to the reasons for refusal." Apart  from  one  or  two  discrepancies,
      there was a 95% accuracy in their respective answers. He relies on the
      reasons "as far as I can."


  70. On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that the 95% success rate
      is good evidence that theirs is a genuine marriage.  The  relationship
      should be found to be genuine. They have lived together since 2014.


Assessment


  71. I have had regard to the Tribunal's decision and approach set  out  in
      Papajorgji (EEA Spouse - marriage of convenience) Greece  [2012]  UKUT
      00038 (IAC).


  72. There is no burden on the claimant in  an  application  for  a  family
      permit  to  establish  that  she  was  not  party  to  a  marriage  of
      convenience unless the circumstances known to the decision maker  give
      reasonable ground for suspecting that this was the case. Absent such a
      basis for suspicion, the application should be granted without more on
      production of the documents set out in Article 10  of  the  Directive.
      Where  there  is  such  suspicion,   the   matter   requires   further
      investigation and the claimant should be invited  to  respond  to  the
      basis of suspicion by producing evidential material to dispel it.


  73. A marriage of convenience in this context is a marriage contracted for
      the sole or decisive purpose of gaining admission to the host state. A
      durable marriage with children and cohabitation is quite  inconsistent
      with such a definition.


  74. I have also had regard to the decision of the Court of Appeal in  Rosa
      [2016] EWCA Civ 14 at [24]. Richards LJ gave  the  only  judgment  and
      stated that in his judgment, the legal burden lies on the Secretary of
      State to prove that an otherwise  valid  marriage  is  a  marriage  of
      convenience so as to justify the  refusal  of  an  application  for  a
      residence card under the EEA Regulations. He stated that the reasoning
      to that effect in Papajorgji, as endorsed in Agho v Secretary of State
      for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 1198, is compelling.


  75. In the course of the judgment in Agho, with which  Moore-Bick  LJ  and
      Vos LJ agreed, Underhill LJ said this about Papajorgji:


      "13. ... What it comes down to is that as  a  matter  of  principle  a
      spouse establishes a prima facie case that  he  or  she  is  a  family
      member of an EEA national by providing the  marriage  certificate  and
      the spouse's passport; that the legal burden is on  the  Secretary  of
      State to  show  that  any  marriage  thus  proved  is  a  marriage  of
      convenience; and that the burden is not discharged merely  by  showing
      'reasonable suspicion'. Of course in  the  usual  way  the  evidential
      burden  may shift to the applicant by proof of facts which justify the
      inference that the marriage is not genuine, and the facts giving  rise
      to the inference may  include  a  failure  to  answer  a  request  for
      documentary proof of the genuineness of the marriage where grounds  of
      suspicion have been raised. Although, as  I  say  the  point  was  not
      argued before us, that approach seems to me to be correct ...."


  76. I found the evidence  of  the  appellant  and  Ms  Ms  Pascaru  to  be
      essentially credible.  There has been no challenge to their assertions
      regarding their cohabitation for several years.


  77. In addition, I have also considered the abundant documentary  evidence
      that was produced to corroborate their assertions. This  evidence  has
      already been set out in detail.  In  his  supplementary  statement  at
      pages 116-117, he stated that he and his  wife  continue  to  live  at
      their address at [~ Walk], Cwmbran.  He  produced  tenancy  agreements
      confirming this. There is also the rent book confirming  regular  rent
      payment; council tax bills in  joint  names  from  2014  to  date  and
      receipts confirming payment. He produced water bills  in  joint  names
      confirming  joint  financial  commitments.  The  bills  from  EE   are
      addressed to his wife and the TV licence is addressed  to  him.  These
      documents were sent to them at [~ Walk].  I have also  had  regard  to
      the evidence of the photographs produced.


  78. From the evidence as a whole that has been produced, I find  that  the
      parties met at a party in June 2014. They met  up  again  and  started
      seeing each other regularly. They began to live together at  [~  Walk]
      before they got married. He proposed to her, and they subsequently got
      married on 25 February 2015.    They  have  since  continued  to  live
      together at the property as husband and wife.


  79. I am satisfied from the evidence as a whole that it has not been shown
      that the marriage is one of convenience. I find that the marriage  was
      not entered into for the sole reason of securing a right to reside  in
      the UK. I find that there has been continuous cohabitation both before
      and after the marriage which has endured up until the present.


  80.  I  accordingly  find  that  theirs  is  a  genuine   and   subsisting
      relationship. Although the marriage undoubtedly provides the appellant
      with  an  immigration  advantage,  this  does  not   result   in   its
      characterisation as a marriage of convenience.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error a point of law. Having set aside the  decision,  I  re-make  it,
      allowing the appellant's appeal under the 2006 Regulations.


      No anonymity direction is made.
