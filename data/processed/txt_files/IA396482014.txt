                       UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CLIVE LANE


                                   Between

                               SUKHWANT SINGH
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The first appellant is a citizen of India. I made directions in the
         following terms on 4 August 2015:

          1. It is arguable  that  the  exercise  of  discretion  to  grant
             indefinite leave to remain  in  this  instance  lay  with  the
             respondent and not the First-tier Tribunal judge.

         Directions

          2. I propose to set aside the First-tier  Tribunal  determination
             and to remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal  to
             the  limited  extent  that  the  matter  is  remitted  to  the
             Secretary of State for her to consider whether  to  grant  the
             appellant indefinite leave to remain. If either party  objects
             to that course of action, they must notify the Upper  Tribunal
             in writing no later than 1600 hours on 21 August 2015.

    2.     I have received no response from either party.

    NOTICE OF DECISION

    The First-tier Tribunal decision  is  set  aside.  I  have  remade  the
    decision. I allow the appellant's appeal to the limited extent that the
    matter is remitted to the  Secretary  of  State  for  her  to  consider
    whether to grant the appellant indefinite leave to remain.
