                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)


This  has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has   been   consented   to by
the parties. The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face to
face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing  I
reserved my decisions  and  reasons,  which  I  now  give.  The  order  made
is described at the end of these reasons.

 1. The appellant, a citizen of South Africa with date of  birth  given  as
    15.2.81, has appealed with permission to the Upper Tribunal against the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal  promulgated  23.10.19,  dismissing
    his appeal against the respondent's decision  of  3.7.19  refusing  his
    application for an EEA Residence Card  as  an  extended  family  member
    (unmarried partner) of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in  the
    UK, pursuant to Regulation 8(5) of the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2016.

 2. On 6.2.20, the First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, finding it arguable that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    misdirected himself in confusing the issue of durable relationship with
    that of a marriage of convenience, applying in error Papajorgji v Entry
    Clearance Officer Nicosia [2012] UKUT 38.

 3. Following the postponement of the error of law  hearing  listed  before
    the Upper Tribunal on 27.3.20, the Upper Tribunal issued directions  on
    24.4.20 proposing that the error of law  decision  be  made  without  a
    hearing and inviting further submissions from the parties.

 4. The tribunal  received  the  respondent's  written  submissions,  dated
    15.5.20. However, there was no response  to  the  directions  from  the
    appellant or his representatives.  The  deadline  for  response  having
    expired, and no party having opposed determination of the error of  law
    issue without a  hearing,  in  my  decision  promulgated  on  6.7.20  I
    concluded, for the reasons there set out, that it  was  appropriate  to
    decide the error of law issue on the papers pursuant to Rule 34.

 5. The respondent's written submissions on the error of law issue accepted
    as "the inescapable sequel" that the First-tier Tribunal Judge may have
    misdirected himself in law in addressing a relationship of  convenience
    and thereby fell into material error.

 6. For the reasons set out in my decision promulgated  on  6.7.20,  I  was
    satisfied that there is a error of law in the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal. It appeared from the two concluding  paragraphs  of  the
    impugned decision that the judge may well have confused the issue of  a
    durable relationship with that  of  a  marriage  of  convenience,  when
    concluding that the relationship was one of convenience. The respondent
    had not asserted a relationship of convenience,  only  that  there  was
    insufficient evidence of a durable relationship. Whilst in the end, the
    judge has referred to not being  satisfied  that  the  relationship  is
    durable, it appears the judge's focus was on  the  relationship  having
    been formed for the purpose of assisting the appellant to remain in the
    UK, and, therefore, as one of convenience.

 7. I identified a further error of law at [20] of the decision, where  the
    judge mistook the address of the  appellant's  representative  for  his
    home address and relied on that factor,  amongst  others,  as  evidence
    undermining the genuineness of the relationship. That error alone would
    be sufficient to establish a material error of law.

 8. In the circumstances, I concluded that the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal could not stand but had to be set aside to be  remade  in  the
    Upper Tribunal, issuing directions proposing that the remaking  of  the
    decision be done remotely, giving the opportunity for submissions as to
    that proposed course of action.

 9. No such objections having been received, the matter was  listed  before
    me on 11.9.20 for remaking of  the  decision  in  the  appeal.  Shortly
    before  that  hearing,  the  appellant's  representative,  Mr  Mustafa,
    forwarded his skeleton  argument,  a  copy  of  which  is  now  in  the
    Tribunal's  Case  File.  He  also  indicated  that  he  relied  on  the
    supplementary bundle sent under cover of letter dated 17.3.20 by way of
    an application under Rule 15 (2A).  Although  the  appellant  was  also
    present at the remote hearing, Mr Mustafa confirmed  that  he  did  not
    intend to call further oral evidence but was content  to  rely  on  the
    supplementary bundle, the original appellant's  bundle,  and  the  oral
    evidence as recorded in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  apart
    from those findings which I have found to be in error of law.

10. However, the respondent's Senior Presenting  Officer,  Mrs  Aboni,  had
    prepared for the hearing on the basis that this was  an  error  of  law
    hearing only. It transpires that she was unaware of  my  decision  made
    under Rule 34 finding an error of law in the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal   and   it   setting   aside,   to   be   remade    at    this
    continuation/resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal. Whilst Mr Mustafa's
    skeleton argument had been forwarded to her by email, Mrs Aboni had not
    received a copy of the appellant's supplementary bundle. Although  this
    was forwarded to her by Mr Mustafa shortly prior to the commencement of
    the hearing, understandably, she said she was entirely unprepared for a
    resumed hearing and sought an adjournment. Mr Mustafa did not  actively
    oppose the adjournment.

11. In these  unfortunate  circumstances,  I  acceded  to  the  adjournment
    request, accepting that the respondent was entirely unprepared for  the
    hearing and, therefore, could not actively participate in the hearing.

12. The appeal came back before me for the resumed hearing on 10.11.20.

13. As stated above, the appellant had applied for an EEA Residence Card as
    an extended family  member  (unmarried  partner)  of  an  EEA  national
    exercising Treaty rights in the UK, pursuant to Regulation 8(5) of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016, which provides that, "The condition
    in this paragraph is that the person is the partner (other than a civil
    partner) of, and in a durable relationship with, an EEA  national,  and
    is able to prove this to the decision maker."

14. 'Durable relationship' is not defined in the Regulations, and whether a
    person is in a durable relationship is a matter to be determined  on  a
    case-by-case basis. The Home Office guidance on  durable  relationships
    provides "A durable relationship is an unmarried partnership which  has
    normally continued for 2 years or more."  However,  it  also  instructs
    decision-makers  that,  "You  must  always  consider   the   individual
    circumstances of the application. For example there  may  be  instances
    when the couple have not been in a relationship for 2  years  or  more,
    but you are still satisfied that the  relationship  is  subsisting  and
    durable."

15. The application was refused because the respondent considered that  the
    appellant had failed to provide  adequate  evidence  that  he  was  the
    partner of an EEA national and that he had a durable relationship  with
    that person. Whilst the  respondent  did  not  raise  the  issue  of  a
    relationship of convenience, it is nevertheless implicit in the reasons
    for  refusal  that,  on  the  limited  information  provided  with  the
    application, the respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  there  was  any
    genuine relationship.

16. The appellant claimed to have been  residing  with  his  partner  since
    March  2019  and  provided  some  documentation  in  support  with  the
    application. However, the respondent  observed  that  the  evidence  of
    cohabitation was very recent. There was no evidence of  joint  finances
    or responsibilities and the  submitted  bank  statements  were  in  the
    sponsor's name  only.  Given  that  failure,  the  respondent  did  not
    consider the other requirements, including  whether  the  EEA  national
    partner was exercising Treaty rights in the UK.

17. The First-tier Tribunal found a number of clear  discrepancies  in  the
    evidence of the appellant and the sponsor at the appeal hearing. In the
    assessment of the judge, they could not provide a consistent account of
    their relationship, such as where and when they were together or living
    at separate addresses and when they  last  socialised  together.  Their
    knowledge of each other's background and family was evidently limited.

18. I have carefully considered the various submissions made to me  in  the
    remote hearing, together with the evidence adduced  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant, taken in the round, before reaching any findings of fact. No
    further documentary  evidence  has  been  adduced.  Although  both  the
    appellant and the sponsor  were  present  in  the  remote  hearing,  Mr
    Mustafa again confirmed that  he  did  not  intend  to  call  any  oral
    evidence but stated that, if  required,  any  clarification  about  the
    documentation could be confirmed with the appellant and the sponsor.

19. In remaking the decision in the appeal, I bear in mind that the  burden
    is on the appellant to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that
    he is in a durable relationship with the sponsor. The skeleton argument
    submits that the first question is whether the relationship is  durable
    and only then should consideration be given to whether it  is  genuine.
    It is argued that it is premature to determine whether the relationship
    is genuine and unless the relationship is durable it cannot be labelled
    as genuine or of convenience. I am not persuaded that can be  right  or
    that it is necessary to distinguish between durable and genuine. In any
    event, for the reasons set out below,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    relationship is durable.

20. The appellant claims to have been in a relationship  with  the  sponsor
    since 31.12.18 and to have resided together with her since March  2019.
    The Council Tax bill for 2019/2020 is in joint names  and  states  that
    the  single  person  discount  ended  on  4.5.19,  which  is   somewhat
    inconsistent with the claimed start of cohabitation. However, the point
    is a small one and I do not rely on it.

21. I accept that other documents produced, including utility  bills,  give
    the appellant's address as the same as that show  for  the  sponsor  in
    other  documents,  such  as  her  wage  slips  and  some  of  the  bank
    statements.  However,  all  the  documentary   evidence   pointing   to
    cohabitation is of very recent date and is, therefore, of limited value
    in assessing whether the relationship is durable.

22. The mere fact that some of bills are in joint names or individual bills
    are addressed to either the  appellant  or  the  sponsor  at  the  same
    address is supportive but of itself insufficient to prove that they are
    in a durable relationship. The same evidence could apply, for  example,
    to two persons not in a relationship but  sharing  accommodation  as  a
    flat-share.

23. I note that in the refusal decision, the respondent was concerned  that
    there  was   no   evidence   of   joint   finances,   commitments,   or
    responsibilities. There is some but limited evidence of that now before
    the Tribunal, which I have carefully considered. However, I  note  that
    at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing the sponsor initially  stated
    that the appellant paid a share of the bills but  it  later  transpired
    that he has no money or income of his own and she  provides  him  money
    with which he contributes to the bills.  That  remained  the  situation
    explained to me at the outset of the resumed  hearing.  Examination  of
    their respective bank statements reveals that their  finances  are  not
    shared and there are no funds passing between their accounts.

24. During the course of the hearing, I pointed out to Mr Mustafa that  the
    appellant's bank statements show large sums passing back  and  forwards
    between  his  account  and  another,  unexplained,  bank  account,  the
    ownership of which is not clear. The  documents  in  the  supplementary
    bundle include his Barclays Everyday Saver account and an Instant  Cash
    ISA account. Both of these show very healthy balances, even  though  Mr
    Mustafa confirmed to me that the appellant  is  not  working  and  that
    "anything he spends  is  support  from  the  sponsor."  Both  of  these
    accounts show large sums of money going into the accounts from  another
    unidentified account ending 3986, which does not match  either  of  the
    sponsor's two disclosed bank accounts.  Between  3.12.19  and  30.1.20,
    some �5,500 was  paid  into  these  accounts.  Asked  to  explain,  the
    appellant  first  stated  that  the  monies  coming  into  the  account
    represented earnings from occasional courier work. However, large  sums
    in round figures seems most improbable to  have  come  from  occasional
    employment as a courier, of which there no supporting evidence has been
    adduced. When pressed, the appellant changed his account to state  that
    the monies were repayments "from someone in the UK who  is  helping  me
    out. A friend." He went on to suggest this person was sometimes  asking
    him to transfer money. When cross-examined  by  Mr  Tan,  he  said  the
    monies came either from a friend or were  payments  for  courier  work.
    However, the appellant was unable to explain why �1,000 was transferred
    from his Barclays account to the 3986 account on  20.1.20,  which  fact
    undermined the claim that the monies represent  earnings  from  courier
    work.

25. When asked to confirm that the sponsor pays all  the  household  bills,
    the  appellant  confirmed  this,  adding  that  because  finances  were
    difficult he also had to step up, thereby  purporting  to  explain  his
    occasional courier work. However, the bank account do not show that the
    appellant  or  for  that  matter  the  sponsor  are  in  any  financial
    difficulties,  in  fact  to  the   contrary,   they   are   financially
    comfortable.

26. Mr Tan asked the appellant about the water utility bill which is in his
    name. This document shows that it is paid by direct debit from the same
    3986 bank account referred to above. The  appellant  claimed  that  the
    direct debit was paid from his bank account but that does not appear in
    the bank statements he has disclosed. If 3986 is his  account,  he  has
    failed to disclose that account. It would also be inconsistent with his
    varying account in evidence that the monies paid into his account  were
    either payment for his occasional courier  work  or  transfers  from  a
    friend.

27. Taking this  evidence  in  the  context  of  the  whole,  I  found  the
    appellant's evidence on this issue entirely incredible. I do not accept
    he was telling the truth and reject the claim that the monies paid into
    his Barclays Bank account represent either repayments from a friend  or
    payment for courier work. It  is  clear  that  there  is  another  bank
    account the ownership of which has not been disclosed and  the  purpose
    for the transfers of large sums has not been adequately  explained.  It
    follows that the financial  circumstances  of  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor have not been fully disclosed, all of which tends undermine the
    claim of a durable relationship.

28. Further difficulties for the appellant arise from the medical  document
    at page 4 of the supplementary bundle. This purports to  be  either  an
    appointment or referral for ultrasound scan arising from  the  clinical
    information: "3 months post miscarriage pain."  Mr  Mustafa  relied  on
    this as evidence of a physical relationship between the  appellant  and
    the sponsor. However, as Mr Tan pointed out, it  does  not  necessarily
    follow that the undated document has anything to do with the appellant,
    to put it delicately.

29. Of greater concern is that the sponsor's address given in  the  medical
    document, and to which it  was  evidently  sent,  is  [~],  Addlestone,
    Surrey, and not [~] in Reading, the address at which the appellant  and
    the sponsor claim to have resided together since March 2019,  and  some
    28 miles away.  I also note that the referring GP practice is  also  at
    an address in Addlestone. In this regard I note that in evidence at the
    First-tier Tribunal  appeal  hearing  the  appellant  stated  that  the
    sponsor spent 2-3 nights a week living in accommodation provided by her
    employer but her evidence was that she spent each night at  their  home
    in Reading, contradicting the appellant. The sponsor told me  that  she
    had kept that address as it was more convenient for her work, which  is
    in Addlestone. That may be possible, but the fact is the discrepancy in
    address detract from rather than assist  the  appellant's  claim  of  a
    durable relationship in which they reside together at  the  address  in
    Reading.

30. In this regard, I note that there has been no challenge to the findings
    of  the   First-tier   Tribunal   identifying   "clear   and   obvious"
    discrepancies between the appellant  and  the  sponsor  in  their  oral
    evidence at the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing in  September  2019,
    set out at [18] of that decision. They were discrepant  as  to  whether
    the sponsor always stayed at their joint address; what  they  had  each
    done the previous weekend; when they last socialised together; and what
    family the appellant had in South Africa.

31. As set out at [19] of the same decision, the sponsor was found to  have
    little and limited knowledge of the  appellant's  background.  She  had
    only met one of his friends, a person whose name she could not  recall.
    She did not know the name of the town in South Africa he came from,  or
    anything about it. She had never spoken to his family.  For  his  part,
    the appellant had never spoken with the sponsor's family, although  she
    claimed she was not herself engaged with her family.

32. Whilst they both make the simple assertion that they have  been  living
    together since March 2019 and enjoy a durable relationship, the witness
    statements of the appellant and the sponsor are very brief and  provide
    surprisingly little to no detail of any  joint  or  shared  lives.  For
    example, there is no reference to shared interests  or  activities,  or
    indeed any aspect of a shared relationship. I find force  in  Mr  Tan's
    submission that if they had been in a durable relationship since  March
    2019 it would be reasonable to expect to see by  now  more  and  better
    evidence of their shared lives. The absence of such evidence  tends  to
    undermine the appellant's case.

33. Considering the evidence overall, in the round and in  the  context  of
    the whole, and for the reasons set out above, I find that the appellant
    has failed to demonstrate that he is in a durable relationship with the
    sponsor.  The  limited  evidence  adduced  is  woefully  inadequate  to
    demonstrate anything more than some form of cohabitation, and begs  far
    more questions than it answers. It follows  that  the  appeal  must  be
    dismissed.



Decision

    The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal was allowed to the  extent
    that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside to be remade
    afresh.

    I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

    I make no order for costs.

    I make no anonymity direction.
