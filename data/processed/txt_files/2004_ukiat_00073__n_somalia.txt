Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. Z. Jafferji (Counsel - instructed by Johar &
Co.)
For the Respondent:    Mr. J. Jones (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant was born on 15 March 1977.  He claimed to be a national
    of Somalia and to be a Brava and a  member  of  a  minority  clan.   He
    appeals to the Tribunal, with permission, from the determination of Mr.
    R. J. Pooler, Adjudicator,  promulgated  on  4  July  2003  whereby  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal on asylum  grounds  and  human  rights
    grounds against the Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  asylum  to  the
    Appellant and against his decision to refuse him  leave  to  enter  the
    United Kingdom and to give directions for his removal to Somalia.

2.    The Respondent in his Reasons for Refusal  Letter  dated  29  October
    2002 made clear  that  he  did  not  believe  that  the  Appellant  was
    Bravanese or that he was even a national of Somalia.   Paragraph  5  of
    the Reasons for Refusal Letter is in the following terms:

            "5.  The Secretary of State is not  satisfied  that  you  are  a
             Somali and has refused your claim for asylum  and  your  human
             rights claim on the basis that you are not Somali.  Directions
             will be given for your removal  to  Somalia  as  this  is  the
             country of which you claim to be a national.   This  is  being
             done solely in order to enable you to appeal to an adjudicator
             and enable the decision to refuse your claim for asylum to  be
             reviewed.  If you appeal against the refusal of your claim for
             asylum and the special adjudicator also concludes that you are
             not Somali, we will seek to establish your true nationality."

3.    The Adjudicator in his determination agreed with  the  Respondent  on
    his contention regarding nationality.  The Adjudicator expressly  found
    in paragraph 46 that the Appellant had not satisfied him, even  to  the
    lower standard of proof, that he is a national of Somalia or that he is
    Bravanese.   Accordingly  the  Adjudicator  dismissed  the  asylum  and
    Article 3 appeal.

4.    The grounds of appeal to the Tribunal did not seek to  challenge  the
    Adjudicator's decision on this aspect, nor  was  permission  to  do  so
    granted nor was any attempt made to challenge this finding  before  the
    Tribunal.  Accordingly it  is  common  ground  that  the  Adjudicator's
    conclusion on this aspect stands and that the Appellant has been  found
    not to be a citizen of Somalia.

5.    Having made this finding, the Adjudicator  went  on  to  consider  an
    Article 8 argument.  This  argument  was  based  upon  various  matters
    including the following:

      (i)   The Appellant on 26 May 2000 married a British citizen, Dilshad
         Noor.

      (ii)  The Appellant's wife is partially  sighted  and  registered  as
         disabled.

      (iii) The Appellant and his wife have two children, Sulaik  Noor  who
         was born on 9 July 2001 and Mohammed Sadeem Noor who was  born  on
         19 December  2002.   Immediately  after  the  hearing  before  the
         Tribunal, the Tribunal  was  handed  a  fax  indicating  that  the
         Appellant's wife is expecting a third child in August.

      (iv)  The younger child has medical  problems  as  described  in  the
         Adjudicator's determination and in the medical reports referred to
         therein.  It is not necessary  to  examine  the  details  of  this
         problem for the purpose of the present determination.

      (v)   Evidence was given regarding the mutual  reliance  between  the
         Appellant and his wife and the difficulties that would  be  caused
         if the Appellant were removed from the United Kingdom.

6.    The Adjudicator considered and dismissed the  Appellant's  Article  8
    appeal.  In introducing his analysis in paragraph 49,  the  Adjudicator
    shows that he is considering the case:

            "If the Appellant is removed to Somalia ..."

7.    At the hearing before the Tribunal there was discussion  between  the
    Tribunal and the representatives as to whether in fact there could have
    been any Article 8 appeal for the Adjudicator to consider,  bearing  in
    mind that he had concluded that the Appellant  was  not  a  citizen  of
    Somalia.  The point which troubled the Tribunal was  as  follows.   The
    appeal to the Adjudicator was  (as  the  Adjudicator  pointed  out)  an
    appeal under Sections 69(1) and 65 of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    1999.  So far as human rights is concerned  therefore,  the  Article  8
    argument would need to involve an allegation that  the  Respondent,  in
    taking  any  decision  under  the  Immigration  Act  relating  to   the
    Appellant's entitlement to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, acted
    in breach of his human rights, see Section 65(1) and (3).  However  the
    decision which the Respondent  took  was  a  decision  as  recorded  in
    paragraph 5 of the Reasons for  Refusal  Letter,  set  out  above.   In
    summary it was a decision to remove the Appellant to  Somalia  if,  but
    only if, the Appellant truly  was  a  citizen  of  Somalia  (which  the
    Respondent did not believe).  The effect of the Respondent's  decision,
    in the light of the Adjudicator's conclusion that the Appellant is  not
    a citizen of Somalia, is that the Appellant faces no immediate prospect
    of being removed from the United Kingdom.  As Mr.  Jones  put  it,  the
    Appellant faces no prospect of being removed to Somalia and no prospect
    of being removed anywhere unless and until the Respondent  has  made  a
    decision as to where the Appellant can properly be removed to  and  has
    made a decision that it would be appropriate to remove him there.

8.    In these circumstances both Mr. Jones and Mr. Jafferji accepted  that
    there could not be a live Article 8 appeal before  the  Tribunal.   Mr.
    Jafferji pointed out, correctly, that any proper  consideration  of  an
    Article 8 appeal in relation to prospective removal of a claimant  from
    the United Kingdom necessarily requires knowledge of where the claimant
    is to be removed - without such knowledge an analysis  of  whether  any
    insurmountable obstacles exist to the rest of the family going with him
    to the destination country cannot be made. Nor in a case (such as this)
    where one or more members of the family have medical difficulties,  can
    any consideration be given, so far as relevant to the Article 8  claim,
    to the difficulties which these medical conditions would place  members
    of the family if they are returned with the claimant.  It is  necessary
    to know which country the claimant is being removed to before any  such
    analysis can properly be made.  Accordingly  for  both  those  reasons,
    namely no imminence of removal and separately no ability to analyse  an
    Article 8 claim without  knowing  the  destination  country,  both  Mr.
    Jafferji and Mr. Jones agreed that the appropriate course of action was
    as follows.  It was agreed, and the Tribunal also agrees, that once the
    Adjudicator had concluded that the  Appellant  was  not  a  citizen  of
    Somalia, the  Appellant could have no present valid  Article  8  appeal
    under Section 65 for the reasons already mentioned.  Accordingly rather
    than examine the merits of an  Article  8  appeal  against  a  notional
    removal to Somalia (which everyone knows is not going  to  happen)  the
    Adjudicator should merely have noted that no  Article  8  argument  was
    presently available to the Appellant.  This is because the Secretary of
    State's decision as set out in paragraph 5 of the Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter is not a decision which can be  in  breach  of  the  Appellant's
    human rights.  In the circumstances which have arisen the  Respondent's
    decision is a decision not to  remove  the  Appellant  to  Somalia  but
    instead to seek to establish the Appellant's true nationality and  then
    to decide what course to take in  respect  of  him.   Such  a  decision
    cannot be in breach of the Appellant's Article 8 rights -  it  involves
    no interference with the Appellant's family life or private life.

9.    The Appellant's appeal must therefore be dismissed.  If and when  the
    Respondent decides to make any further removal directions in respect of
    the Appellant, to some other country, the Appellant will have  all  his
    potential arguments available to him, including arguments under Article
    8 so far as appropriate.  The Tribunal indicated that in dismissing the
    Appellant's appeal it would record that, while agreeing with the result
    that the Article 8 appeal must be dismissed, it took this view for  the
    reasons mentioned in this determination (namely that there could not be
    a live Article 8 point before  the  Adjudicator  bearing  in  mind  his
    finding that the claimant was not a Somali citizen), rather than  by  a
    reason of an examination of the alleged merits of an  Article  8  claim
    against the background of a proposed removal to Somalia.  The fact that
    this appeal is being dismissed is not intended as  any  endorsement  by
    the Tribunal of the Adjudicator's reasoning in relation to  the  merits
    of the perceived Article 8 claim.  This consideration of the merits was
    irrelevant and the Tribunal neither expresses agreement or disagreement
    with it.

10.   In the result therefore the Appellant's appeal is dismissed.
