For the Appellant:     Mr M Harris, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellants are citizens of India. The First Appellant was born  on
    20th May 1972 and claims to have  arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    October 1995.  He claimed asylum on 12th April 1998 which  was  refused
    on 19th May 1998.   His appeal was dismissed  on  24th  November  1998.
    He states that his correct name is Mr Hardip Singh and that his  actual
    date of birth is not as quoted by the Secretary of State but  1st  July
    1970.  He has remained in the United Kingdom since arriving in  October
    1995 and therefore has been in the country in excess of 17ï¿½ years.  His
    partner is the Second Appellant born on 24th March 1981, and their  son
    the Third Appellant born on 22nd May 2004.  The  Second  Appellant  Mrs
    Tilakpal Kaur first arrived in the United Kingdom in June 2003  through
    an agent as a visitor.  Whilst  in  the  United  Kingdom  she  met  the
    Appellant and they decided to get married following  a  Sikh  religious
    ceremony.  Mrs Kaur returned to India  and  gave  birth  to  the  Third
    Appellant then she arrived back in the United Kingdom  along  with  the
    Third Appellant and since  then  has  lived  together  with  the  First
    Appellant as a family.

2.    On 22nd October 2010 the First Appellant wrote  to  the  Secretary  of
    State and his letter was treated as  a  fresh  application  for  asylum
    and/or a fresh human rights claim.  It was confirmed in a  reasons  for
    refusal letter dated 22nd February 2013 at  paragraph  x.   Within  the
    same Notice of Refusal  the  Appellants  claims  were  refused  by  the
    Secretary of State.

3.    The Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First
    Tier Tribunal De Garro sitting at Hatton Cross on 17th  December  2013.
    In a determination promulgated on 22nd January  2014,  the  Appellants'
    appeal was dismissed.

4.    On 31st January 2014 grounds  of  appeal  were  lodged  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  On 10th February 2014, Judge  of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    Astle granted permission to appeal.  Judge Astle noted that there  were
    predominantly three grounds of appeal

      (i)     That the Judge had made no express finding on the  credibility
    of the First Appellant's own evidence and that it was submitted on  the
    First Appellant's behalf that the Judge  had  failed  to  explain  what
    weight she attached to the evidence and why, and had not  given  proper
    consideration to the evidence.

      (ii)       That a central part of the case of the First Appellant  was
    his reliance upon witnesses to support his claim of continual residence
    in the United Kingdom since October 199 5 and that  the  Judge  it  was
    submitted, had erred in law in paragraph 29 of her  determination  when
    deciding to place no evidential weight on that evidence.

      (iii)      In paragraph 30 of the determination the Judge  found  that
    there was a possibility  that  the  First  Appellant  left  the  United
    Kingdom between 1998 and 2007 and that on that basis she had found that
    the First Appellant failed to prove his claim of  continual  residence.
    It was contended that the Judge had failed  to  consider  that  a  mere
    possibility was not sufficient by itself to prevent  the  discharge  of
    the burden of proof when it is on the balance of probabilities and that
    a claim can be proved  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  even  if  a
    possibility to the contrary exists.  It was  therefore  submitted  that
    the Judge had not correctly applied  the  standard  of  proof  in  this
    matter.

5.    Judge Astle considered that it was  arguable  that  in  "attaching  no
    evidential weight" to the evidence of the witnesses, just because  they
    were friends of the Appellant, the Judge erred  in  law,  and  on  that
    basis granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

6.    On 24th February  2014,  the  Secretary  of  State  responded  to  the
    grounds of appeal under Rule 24.  The Respondent submitted inter  alia,
    that  the  Judge  of  the  First   Tier   Tribunal   directed   herself
    appropriately and that she was entitled to find that the Appellant  had
    not discharged the burden of proof and to reject the  evidence  of  the
    witnesses on the basis that it was self serving and  insufficient  with
    the gaps in the documentary evidence to discharge the burden  of  proof
    to the requisite standard.

7.    It is on that basis that the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First Tier Tribunal.  The Appellants appear by their instructed Counsel
    Mr Harris.   Mr Harris has experience of this matter in that he is  the
    author of the grounds of appeal in the Upper Tribunal.   The  Secretary
    of State appears by her Home Office Presenting Officer Mr Avery.

Submissions

8.    Mr  Harris  submits  that  the  grounds  identify  the  three  errors.
    Firstly, he points out that this is fundamentally a long residence case
    and that there is no documentary evidence available to cover the  whole
    period that the First Appellant claims that  ever  since  he  made  the
    application  for  asylum  he  has  resided  in   the   United   Kingdom
    continually.  He acknowledges that his wife has been in and out of  the
    United Kingdom but that she has in fact been here since 2006 with their
    son, the Third Appellant.

9.    Secondly, he submits there has been no express  finding  made  on  the
    credibility of the Appellant's own evidence, and points  out  that  the
    Appellant relies on the evidence of other people to confirm his  period
    of long residence and that this is addressed at  paragraph  29  of  the
    First Tier Tribunal Judge's determination.  He submits that the Judge's
    finding in rejecting that evidence on the basis that the witnesses were
    close friends and self serving is entirely wrong and not  a  reason  in
    itself, and just because people are close friends that  does  not  mean
    that they cannot be trusted.  He considers on that basis  the  decision
    is unsafe.  He points out that that the Judge has identified no problem
    with regard to the plausibility  of  the  witnesses,  and  consequently
    without having provided a well reasoned explanation for  rejecting  the
    evidence, she was wrong to do so.

10.   Thirdly he submits that an error in the determination at paragraph  30
    is of a more technical nature, pointing out that  the  existence  of  a
    possibility does not prevent  the  Appellant  proving  his  case  on  a
    balance of probabilities and therefore there is an illegal flaw in  the
    approach that has been adopted by the First Tier  Tribunal  Judge.   He
    submits that all grounds show that the Judge has  materially  erred  in
    law in her approach, and  that  the  correct  approach  for  the  Upper
    Tribunal is to find a material error of law and to remit the case to be
    reheard before the First Tier Tribunal.

11.   Mr Avery acknowledges that the approach  is  to  whether  or  not  the
    Appellant was or was not in the United Kingdom as set out at paragraphs
    27 and 28 is to use his words "rather odd".  He submits that the burden
    is not a high one.  However, he submits that the principle argument  is
    to acknowledge that the determination is by no means  perfect,  but  to
    point out that the Judge has looked at everything  in  the  round,  and
    provided that there is no documentary evidence available to  show  that
    the Appellant was not in the United Kingdom, has led  to  a  course  of
    findings to be made at  paragraphs  29  and  30  which  the  Judge  was
    entitled to reach.  He seeks to advance  no  further  arguments  beyond
    this, but to maintain the position as set out in the Rule 24  Response.



The Law

12.   Errors of legislative interpretation,  failure  to  following  binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account   immaterial   consideration,
    reaching irrational conclusions on  fact  or  evaluation  give  legally
    inadequate  reasons  for  the  decision  and   procedural   unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

13.   It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration  Judge  to  give
    too little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality
    is alleged. Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to  fail
    to deal with every factual issue of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story told is untrue.  If a  point
    of evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is
    a failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings on Error of Law

14.   The principle challenge to this determination is that  the  Judge  has
    made no express findings on the  credibility  of  the  Appellant's  own
    evidence.  The Appellant relied on witnesses to support  his  claim  of
    continual residence in the  United  Kingdom  since  October  1995.   At
    paragraph 29  of  her  determination  the  Judge  fails  to  place  any
    evidential weight on that evidence and I am satisfied that that  is  an
    error of law and that is material.  It is a leap of faith by the  Judge
    to merely find that as witnesses are close friends, their  evidence  is
    self serving and thereupon  to  place  no  evidential  weight  on  that
    evidence.  This is particularly true because as is pointed  out  by  Mr
    Harris and seemingly conceded by Mr Avery, the Judge has not identified
    any inconsistency or implausibility  per  se  in  any  of  the  witness
    evidence, and that that is after cross examination by the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer.  Consequently having carried out such  an  analysis
    to reject that evidence simply as being self serving is wrong, and  the
    Judge needed to provide adequate reasoning for  rejecting  the  central
    part of the Appellant's case.

15.   In the light of such circumstances, the  technical  challenges  become
    of substantially less importance.   For  all  the  above  reasons,  the
    determination discloses material errors of law and is unsafe and in the
    interests of justice the correct approach in this matter  is  to  remit
    the matter back to the First Tier Tribunal to be heard  afresh  by  any
    Judge other than Immigration Judge De Garro.

Directions

16.   It was agreed by both legal representatives that  this  was  a  matter
    that I would need to retire to consider as to whether or not there  was
    a material error of law and I consequently reserved my decision so that
    it was not immediately possible for this matter to be relisted  in  the
    usual manner and assigned to  a  Judge  back  at  Hatton  Cross.   What
    however was agreed, was that if the matter were remitted the  following
    directions would apply.

      i)   That the decision of the First Tier Tribunal  Judge  contained  a
    material error of law and that the decision be set aside and the matter
    is remitted to the First  Tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard  on  the  first
    available date 28 days hence at Hatton Cross with an  estimated  length
    of hearing of 3 hours.

      ii)    None of the findings of fact of the  First  Tier  determination
    are to stand.

      iii)  The matter to be listed before any salaried or  fee  paid  Judge
    of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  other  than
    Immigration Judge De Garro.

      iv) That a record of proceedings from the  original  hearing  be  made
    available for the rehearing before the First Tier Tribunal.

      v)   That in the event of the  Appellant's  representatives  requiring
    an interpreter, they do notify the Tribunal immediately upon receipt of
    this determination.


Decision

17.   The decision of the First Tier Tribunal contains a material  error  of
    law and is set aside.

18.   The Appellant's appeal against the refusal by the Secretary  of  State
    is remitted to the First Tier Tribunal for rehearing at Hatton Cross on
    the first available date 28 days hence  before  any  Immigration  Judge
    other than Immigration Judge De Garro.  Directions for the rehearing of
    this matter are set out above.

30.   The First Tier Tribunal Judge did not make an Order pursuant  to  Rule
    45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
     No application is made to vary that Order and none is made.
