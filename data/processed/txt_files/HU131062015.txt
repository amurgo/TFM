Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity order was made by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I  find  that  no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case  that  give  rise  to  the
need for a direction. For this reason, no anonymity direction is made.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

   1. The Appellant appeals the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  J
      Austin promulgated on 7  November  2016  ("the  Decision").   By  the
      Decision, the  Judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  a
      decision dated 26 November 2015 refusing the Appellant's human rights
      claim. As this  appeal  post-dates  the  coming  into  force  of  the
      amendments to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  the
      Appellant's appeal is limited to human rights and protection grounds.
      There is no protection claim in this case.


   2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan.  He initially came to the UK
      on 9 March 2006 with entry clearance as a Tier 4 student  with  leave
      to remain.  His leave to remain was extended  in  various  categories
      until 15 April 2015.  Prior to expiry of his leave on that  occasion,
      the Appellant applied for indefinite leave to  remain  ("ILR")  as  a
      Tier 1 migrant ("the April 2015 application").  Prior  to  the  April
      2015 application, the Appellant had leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
      (General) Migrant dating back to 2010 and extended in 2013. The April
      2015 application was refused on 4 August 2015  for  reasons  which  I
      deal with at [3] and [4] below.  The  refusal  was  maintained  on  2
      September 2015 following an administrative review.  There is no right
      of appeal against either of those decisions.  However, on 7 September
      2015, the Appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain  based  on
      ten years' lawful residence  ("the  ILR  application").   It  is  the
      refusal of that application which is under appeal.


   3.  Although the Appellant has no right of appeal against the refusal of
      the April 2015  application,  the  refusal  of  that  application  is
      relevant to the  refusal  of  the  ILR  application.  The  Respondent
      refused the April 2015  application  due  to  a  discrepancy  between
      figures provided to the Respondent in an  application  in  2013  when
      compared with figures declared to HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC"). In
      short summary, the Applicant failed  to  disclose  to  HMRC  dividend
      payments made to him by his company, Naveed Ltd, in his self-employed
      capacity.  Those related to the tax year  2012-13  and  were  in  the
      gross  sum  of  �9,111.   The  Appellant  has  since  rectified  that
      omission.  There is no tax consequence of the failure to declare  due
      to the taxation treatment  of  dividends  and  tax  credits  in  that
      regard.


   4. The Respondent refused the April 2015 application as a result of  the
      discrepancy on two  bases.   First,  she  did  not  accept  that  the
      Appellant's earnings as declared to her on the previous occasion were
      genuine. If the Appellant's self-employed earnings reflected  in  the
      dividends were left out of account,  the  Appellant  would  not  have
      scored sufficient points for earnings in the  2013  application.  The
      Appellant did not therefore score points  for  his  earnings  in  the
      April 2015 application as the Respondent  did  not  accept  that  the
      earnings relied upon were genuine. Second, because of the discrepancy
      between the figures declared to the Respondent and those declared  to
      HMRC, the Respondent refused the application under  paragraph  322(5)
      of the  Immigration  Rules  ("the  Rules")  on  the  basis  that  the
      Appellant's character and conduct was such as to render his  presence
      in the UK undesirable.


   5. When refusing the Appellant's ILR application, the Respondent decided
      that it would be undesirable for the  Appellant  to  be  granted  ILR
      (relying on paragraph 276B(ii) of the Rules) and that the application
      fell to be refused on general grounds (applying  paragraph  276B(iii)
      and due to the rejection of the April 2015  application).    The  ILR
      application was also considered under paragraph 276ADE  but  rejected
      on the basis that the Appellant had not resided in  the  UK  for  the
      requisite period and there are no very significant obstacles  to  his
      integration in Pakistan.


   6. The Judge in the Decision upheld the Respondent's  finding  that  the
      Appellant had exercised deception previously and therefore  that  the
      Respondent had correctly refused the April 2015 application  applying
      paragraph 322(5) of the Rules. In consequence  of  that  finding,  he
      dismissed the appeal, finding that ILR should be refused  because  of
      the Appellant's previous conduct and because paragraph 322(5) of  the
      Rules applied.


   7. The Appellant appeals the Decision on four grounds.  Grounds  one  to
      three focus on the  Judge's  finding  that  the  Appellant  exercised
      deception in the April 2015 application. First, the Appellant submits
      that the Judge failed to consider that the Appellant  had  no  reason
      not to declare the correct income to HMRC as there were  minimal  tax
      consequences arising from  the  error  (in  fact  there  were  none).
      Second, it is said that the Judge failed to consider  that  paragraph
      322(5) is a discretionary ground for refusal and to consider  whether
      discretion should have been  exercised  in  the  Appellant's  favour,
      particularly since the Appellant secured no financial advantage  from
      his failure to declare the dividend income.  Third, the Judge  failed
      to consider whether the alleged deception was aimed  at  securing  an
      immigration advantage  (relying  on  the  headnote  in  Ozhogina  and
      Tarasova (deception within para 320(7B) - nannies) Russia [2011] UKUT
      00197 (IAC)).  In short summary, the Appellant submits that the Judge
      should not have found that the Appellant exercised deception  in  the
      April 2015 application and  should  not  therefore  have  found  that
      paragraph 322(5) applied and that it would be  undesirable  to  grant
      the Appellant ILR.


   8. The fourth ground is that the  Judge  misunderstood  the  Appellant's
      evidence in his finding that one of the answers  the  Appellant  gave
      when interviewed by the Respondent about the April  2015  application
      contradicted an answer he gave later in the same interview.


   9. Permission was granted on all grounds by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Gibb on 20 March 2017 on the basis that  all  grounds  are  arguable.
      The matter comes before me to determine whether the Decision involved
      the making of an error of law and if so either to re-make it or remit
      the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for re-making.


   Discussion and conclusions

  10. As I indicate at [2] above, the Respondent's decision to  refuse  the
      April 2015 application was not one  which  could  be  appealed.   The
      Appellant could have challenged that  decision  by  way  of  judicial
      review but chose not to  do  so.   The  reason  why  the  April  2015
      application was refused though is central to the reason why  the  ILR
      application failed and for that reason, the Judge was right to  focus
      on that issue.


  11. I  can  deal  briefly  with  the  Appellant's  fourth  ground.   When
      interviewed  by  the  Respondent's  officer  about  the  April   2015
      application, the Appellant was asked the following question:-


            "[12]      You mentioned your own business - Naveed  Limited  -
           are you claiming earnings from this company for your  settlement
           application?"


      The Appellant replied that  he  was  not.   He  was  then  asked  the
      following question:-


            "[17]      What dividends did you receive from Naveed Limited -
      do you recall?"


      The Appellant said that it was "Around �8,000"


  12. The Judge dealt with what he said was an inconsistency at [20] of the
      Decision as follows:-


           "...At question 12 he said that he  was  not  claiming  earnings
           from his own business in support of his settlement  application.
           He said again that he was not claiming any self-employed  income
           in support of his application.  He said that the limited company
           had started in September or October 2012  and  had  been  closed
           down in August 2013 because of the  overwhelming  workload  from
           his employment.  It was then at question  17  of  the  interview
           that the appellant reversed his earlier position  and  disclosed
           that he had in fact received a dividend of  approximately  �8000
           from Naveed Limited."


  13. The Appellant is right to point out that there  is  no  inconsistency
      between the answers given as the former question was dealing with the
      April 2015 application whereas the latter  question  was  a  response
      about the earnings declared in the 2013 application.   I  agree  with
      Mr Kotas' submission, though, that this error is not a material  one.
      In fact, as appears from [23] of the Decision (cited at [17]  below),
      the Judge understood that the discrepancy in relation to the dividend
      payments arose from the 2013  application  and  not  the  April  2015
      application.  There is no finding that the Appellant is not  credible
      on the basis of the inconsistency in the Appellant's  answers  or  at
      the very least it is not the sole reason for finding his evidence not
      to be credible.


  14. I turn then to deal with the remaining three grounds.  The  focus  of
      those is on reasons given by the Judge for finding that the Appellant
      exercised deception by failing to declare the dividend to HMRC.


  15. The Appellant's explanation for the failure to disclose the dividends
      to HMRC is that he left his tax affairs to  accountants  and  trusted
      that they would provide the correct information.   He  says  that  he
      gave his accountants the right information  and  therefore  that  the
      failure to  disclose  the  dividends  was  their  fault.   The  Judge
      recounts that explanation at [5] of the  Decision.   The  Judge  then
      deals with the reason why the  Respondent  rejected  the  April  2015
      application at [6] and [7] as follows:-


            "[6] The respondent considered (and  it  is  agreed)  that  the
           application would have failed without the declared income of the
           dividends from Naveed Ltd, as the  declared  income  would  have
           been too low to meet the requirements.


            [7]  The respondent considered that it was not clear  that  the
           appellant had in fact received the dividends claimed,  as  there
           was no evidence of the same other than  the  appellant's  claim.
           It was therefore unclear whether the dividends were  earned  but
           not declared, or not  earned  in  the  first  place  and  merely
           created to create a false impression of a level of  income  that
           would support the application for indefinite leave to remain."


  16. The crux of the Appellant's case is set out at [17] of  the  Decision
      as follows:-


           "The tribunal was asked to consider paragraphs 8 and  9  of  the
           appellant's statement at  pages  6  and  7  of  the  appellant's
           bundle.  This was the crux of the appellant's appeal.  He  never
           had any intention to mislead any government authority, be it the
           Revenue or the Home Office.  His argument that the  only  reason
           that anyone would have failed to make a return in the way he had
           done so would be to evade tax, and it was clear that no tax  was
           being avoided other than  a  very  small  amount;  it  was  more
           probable that the omission arose because  of  a  mistake  rather
           than by an attempt at financial gain arising out of  an  attempt
           at  tax  evasion.   The  allegation  of  the  appellant   having
           intentionally misled is not supported by cogent  evidence.   The
           appellant was shocked at the time  of  his  interview  that  the
           dividend had not been accounted  for.   He  had  given  all  his
           documents to  the  accountants  and  had  paid  them  for  their
           services.  His spontaneous response when he  discovered  it  was
           shock that his tax return had not been filed  with  the  Revenue
           and there was no intention  to  mislead  either  agency  of  the
           government.  He submits that the dividend was a real one and his
           bank account show that it was paid.  The  respondent  has  found
           him to be a person of unsuitable character for the  purposes  of
           his application for indefinite leave to  remain  over  the  non-
           payment of �1.60 tax, whilst ignoring the  �14,074.70  that  the
           appellant has paid over the last few years to the Exchequer."


  17. The Judge rejected the Appellant's evidence in relation to the reason
      for the non-declaration of income at [19] to  [22]  of  the  Decision
      before making the following findings:-


            "[23]      I find from the evidence that  the  appellant  is  a
           highly educated information technology  analyst  and  consultant
           who has worked for a number of highly reputable  and  well-known
           organisations.  In 2012  he  chose  to  start  his  own  limited
           company which he closed down in 2013.  In 2013 he was making  an
           application for indefinite leave to remain.   One  of  the  most
           significant  aspects  of  his  application  as  far  as  he  was
           concerned was in demonstrating a level  of  income  which  would
           score points  sufficiently  to  support  his  application.   The
           appellant must have been keenly aware of the significance of the
           income requirements for his application.  He said that  he  was.
           It is agreed that without the additional income from his claimed
           dividend from the limited company  his  application  would  have
           failed on the points system that applied to income.


            [24] I find that the appellant was familiar  with  the  revenue
           system in United Kingdom.  During his interview when he  claimed
           to have been surprised to be told that he had not  accounted  to
           the Revenue for his dividend he  demonstrated  that  he  had  an
           intimate knowledge of the tax  that  he  had  paid  both  as  an
           individual and through the limited company and  the  corporation
           tax.  In fact, he  sought  to  explain  that  he  had  not  been
           concerned about the lack of any documentation or tax demand from
           the Revenue by the fact that he considered that he  had  already
           paid sufficient corporation tax.  I find that the appellant  did
           have an awareness of  the  requirements  of  him  as  a  company
           director and as an individual to account for tax.  He  had  been
           employed as an IT analyst by several highly  regarded  firms  of
           solicitors where the highest standards  of  propriety  would  be
           expected from all employees.  I  disagree  with  the  submission
           that allowance should be made for the appellant not  being  good
           with figures and dates.  The circumstances of his education  and
           employment suggest the complete opposite.  I  find  that  it  is
           more likely than not that he was aware that  he  had  failed  to
           account to the Revenue for his dividend.  I also find  that  the
           appellant did fall into the category of  person  whose  previous
           character and conduct in making his application  for  indefinite
           leave to remain and claiming to have received a  dividend  which
           he had not accounted for in a tax return, meant that he fell  to
           be refused under paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
           Although the applicant later  submitted  a  tax  return  to  the
           Revenue on 4 August 2015 to rectify their records, I  find  that
           the previous deception which is  a  finding  in  regard  to  the
           appellant's  character  and  conduct  in  misleading  government
           departments in relation to his previous income  means  that  the
           decision to refuse  his  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
           remain under the immigration rules was correct.


      Based on those findings, the Judge found that the Appellant failed to
      qualify for ILR.


  18. The Appellant's first three grounds and Mr Eaton's submissions  focus
      on the allegation of deception on the basis that this  deception  was
      practised against HMRC.  As Mr Kotas pointed out,  though,  this  was
      not the Respondent's case nor was it the way in which the Judge found
      against the Appellant.   The  essence  of  the  finding  against  the
      Appellant (particularly in light of what  is  said  at  [23]  of  the
      Decision) is that the deception was practised against the  Respondent
      by inflating the earnings in the  2013  application.   As  such,  the
      grounds which argue that there was no tax  advantage  resulting  from
      the non-declaration and that discretion should have been exercised in
      the  Appellant's  favour  because  of  the  minimal  tax  effect  are
      misconceived.  Similarly, ground three which suggests that the  Judge
      did not find that the Appellant was seeking to mislead the Respondent
      is misplaced.  Although I accept that the  finding  at  [24]  of  the
      Decision is not as clear as it might be, when [23] and  [24]  of  the
      Decision are read together, it becomes clear  that  the  Judge  found
      that the Appellant stood to  benefit  from  the  dividend  income  in
      support of his 2013 application as, without it, he would not have met
      the earnings threshold.  The fact that the Appellant did not  declare
      this dividend to HMRC cast doubt on whether the dividend was  genuine
      income  and  therefore  the  Appellant  had  exercised  deception  in
      relation to his income.


  19. However, as it became  clear  in  submissions  that  the  Appellant's
      grounds focussed on  the  wrong  target,  Mr  Eaton  made  a  further
      submission which leads me to the conclusion that  the  Decision  does
      contain a material error of law.  This relates to the other  evidence
      which was before the Judge as to  the  genuineness  of  the  dividend
      income.  As Mr Eaton pointed out, there are in the Appellant's bundle
      bank  statements  from  the  Appellant's  personal  account  and  the
      business accounts of Naveed Ltd.   Those  accounts  show  withdrawals
      from the business accounts on dates between January  and  March  2013
      and corresponding credits to the Appellant's personal account.    The
      total of those debits and credits equate  to  �8,200.   Although  the
      amount of the dividends which the Appellant should have  declared  to
      HMRC is �9,111, as the accountant's letter dated 2 April  2013  makes
      clear that is the gross dividend and the net amount is �8,200.


  20. Although the Judge did refer at [17] of the Decision to  there  being
      evidence of the payments of dividends into the  Appellant's  account,
      the Judge did not consider this evidence when reaching his  findings.
      That is a material error.  A Judge  might  be  entitled  to  reach  a
      finding that the Appellant inflated his income in order to secure the
      necessary points even taking  into  account  that  evidence  (if  for
      example there  was  a  finding  that  the  money  transfers  did  not
      represent  genuine  earnings).   However,  on  the  face   of   those
      documents, and the coincidence of amounts claimed, another Judge  may
      well reach the view that those earnings  were  genuine.   Bearing  in
      mind that the Appellant does not derive  any  benefit  (financial  or
      otherwise) by failing to declare that income to HMRC, that  may  well
      impact on the finding that the Appellant did  exercise  deception  in
      the 2013 application (and therefore the April 2015  application).   A
      finding that the  Appellant  did  not  exercise  deception  would  be
      central to the outcome of the appeal against the refusal of  the  ILR
      application.


  21. Mr Eaton and Mr Kotas agreed that if I found an  error  of  law,  the
      appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  The  focus  of
      the appeal is the deception alleged against the  Appellant.   I  have
      found that the  Judge  materially  erred  in  his  finding  that  the
      Appellant exercised deception. Since the Appellant's  credibility  is
      in issue, it is appropriate for the appeal  to  be  remitted  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal for re-making of  the  decision  by  a  different
      Judge.


      DECISION


    I am satisfied that the Decision contains a material error of law for
    the reasons given above. The decision of Judge J Austin promulgated on
    7 November 2016 is set aside. I remit the appeal to the First-tier
    Tribunal for re-hearing before a Judge other than Judge Austin.  I do
    not preserve any findings.
