For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Tipping) dismissing her appeal  against  the
    decision by the Secretary of State  to  refuse  to  issue  her  with  a
    permanent residence card as the family member of  Ms  Laura  Ebby  (the
    sponsor)  pursuant  to  Regulation  15  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area)  Regulations  2006.   Judge  Tipping  did  not  make  an
    anonymity order, as there was no evidence that the appellant  would  be
    at risk of harm by reason of  publication  of  her  name  and  personal
    details, and he did  not  consider  that  the  appeal  involved  highly
    personal evidence which  should  remain  confidential.   By  parity  of
    reasoning, I do not consider that an anonymity order is  warranted  for
    these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Ivory Coast, whose date of  birth  is  5
    July 1945.  Her sponsor was  her  daughter,  a  French  national.   The
    application made on 20 April 2013 was refused on 6 November 2013 on the
    grounds that she had not provided satisfactory evidence  to  show  that
    her EEA sponsor was exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom from
    April 2008 to December 2012 by way of P60s, wage slips, bank statements
    and other documents.  As a result, the Home Office had been  unable  to
    establish that her EEA sponsor had been exercising treaty rights in the
    United Kingdom for a continuous period of five years as a worker.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision, of the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Tipping sitting in the  First-
    tier Tribunal at Taylor House on 25  March  2014.   The  appellant  was
    represented by Mr Eteko, and Mr Lenanton of Counsel appeared on  behalf
    of the respondent.  The appellant adopted as  her  evidence-in-chief  a
    witness statement in which she said she had last arrived in the  UK  on
    30 August 2008 as the family  member  of  an  EEA  national  exercising
    treaty  rights.   She  subsequently  submitted  an  application  for  a
    residence card on that basis, and she was issued with a residence  card
    which was valid from 25 September 2009 until 25 September 2013.  As her
    daughter applied successfully for an internal position at Barclays Bank
    in London, they relocated in 2010.  The accommodation she first  rented
    was a one bedroom flat.  As the accommodation was overcrowded  (as  her
    daughter's son also lived there) she had to move  to  another  property
    not that far away.  The situation had been the same to  date.   Despite
    not living at her daughter's  place,  she  spent  all  her  time  there
    cooking for all the family,  doing  the  laundry  and  other  household
    chores, and doing the school run as her daughter worked full-time.

 4. Although she was in receipt of a pension, she got additional  financial
    support from her daughter.  She did not spend any money on food as  she
    ate at her place.  Without  her  daughter's  financial  assistance,  it
    could have been difficult for her to pay her fuel bills in the  winter.



 5. The appellant's bundle also contained  a  witness  statement  from  Mrs
    Laura Ebby signed on 17 March 2014.  She says she  was  married  to  Mr
    Kouassi, and they had two children.  She had been working for  Barclays
    Bank since 2008, and she was currently on maternity leave.  Her  mother
    moved to her own place in February 2011, but she still  spent  all  her
    time at her place.  Her mother helped her with the cooking, laundry and
    other household chores.  Despite her mother receiving  a  pension,  she
    still assisted her mother financially  considering  the  high  cost  of
    living in London.

 6. Judge Tipping's determination was subsequently promulgated on 18  April
    2014.  He found that the appellant had discharged the burden of proving
    that the sponsor had been continuously employed by Barclays as claimed,
    first in Glasgow and then to date in Plumstead, and that therefore  she
    had been exercising treaty rights (for a continuous period of at  least
    five years) as required by the Regulations.  However, the judge went on
    to find  that  the  appellant  did  not  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    Regulation 7, as she was not dependent on the sponsor.   His  reasoning
    was as follows:

         10.  Furthermore, to meet Regulation 7, as a direct relative of the
             sponsor's ascending line, the appellant must be  dependent  on
             the sponsor.  The appellant said that the sponsor used to send
             her occasional gifts of money in the hands of visiting friends
             when she was in the Ivory  Coast,  but  the  sponsor  couldn't
             often do so as she was a student.  I note that since not later
             than August 2009 the appellant has been in receipt of  pension
             credit, cold weather payments and other benefits.  It does not
             therefore appear to be the case that she is dependent  on  the
             sponsor.  The appellant states that the sponsor gives her  �50
             to �100 per month, but there is no evidence to  support  this,
             including  any  evidence  from  the  sponsor,  whose   written
             statement  does  not  mention  any  gifts  of  money  to   the
             appellant.  It is submitted the statements of the  appellant's
             bank account show it to be continuously overdrawn,  and  there
             is no other evidence of the family finances  of  the  sponsor,
             such as to establish her ability to maintain the appellant.

         11.  Regrettably, the sponsor did not attend the hearing,  so  that
             there has been no opportunity to put  these  matters  to  her.
             Her written statement is  brief  and  lacking  in  detail.   I
             recognise that the sponsor has recently  given  birth  to  her
             second child, and this may have made it difficult for  her  to
             be present at the hearing.  No application for an  adjournment
             on this ground was made.  The appellant said in evidence  that
             moving to her own accommodation was a matter  of  convenience,
             as there was insufficient space in the sponsor's flat for  her
             to live there comfortably with the sponsor's immediate family.
              She said that she spends much of her time  at  the  sponsor's
             home,  helping  with  her  grandchildren  and  with  household
             chores, and that the sponsor gives her food when she is there.



         12.  This evidence does not to my mind alter the  plain  fact  that
             the appellant does not live with the sponsor, and has not done
             so for three years.  At the date in 2008  when  the  appellant
             was granted a residence card, the position was different:  she
             was living in the sponsor's household in Glasgow, and she  was
             not then  in  receipt  of  benefits.   Given  the  appellant's
             reliance on benefits, there is  also  inadequate  evidence  to
             show that the appellant is dependent on the sponsor.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 7. The appellant applied for permission to appeal, arguing that the  judge
    had erred in law by not taking into account all relevant matters on the
    issue of dependency, and applying the wrong legal  test  vis-�-vis  the
    issue of dependency.  The judge had applied the equivalent of a "wholly
    or mainly" dependency test appropriate to the Immigration Rules, but in
    EU law the  test  was  not  whether  a  person  was  wholly  or  mainly
    dependent, but whether he was reliant on others  for  essential  living
    needs.

 8. The evidence of the appellant that she spent more of her  time  at  the
    sponsor's house where she ate,  that  the  sponsor  provided  her  with
    financial assistance of �50 to �100  a  month,  and  that  without  the
    sponsor's assistance life would have been difficult for her, was  never
    challenged by the respondent and no adverse comments were made  by  the
    judge regarding this evidence.



The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 9. On 22 May 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson granted permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

         The judge found the appellant  who  did  not  reside  with  an  EEA
         national had not done so for three years.  In Dauhoo [2012] UKHL 79
         (IAC) it was held that a person applying as an OFM must show either
         current residence with the sponsor or  current  dependency  on  the
         sponsor.  As for dependency, the judge found the appellant had been
         in receipt of pension  credit,  cold  weather  payments  and  other
         benefits since August 2009.  Moreover, he did not consider the case
         of SM (India) and Others v ECO (Mumbai) [2009]  EWCA  Civ  1426  in
         which the Court of Appeal concluded that 'Dependency did  not  have
         to be of necessity.  The  Lebon  test  still  applied  and  it  was
         sufficient  if  in  fact  the  sponsor  supplied  support  for  the
         essential needs in the country of origin whether he had the ability
         to supply his needs from his own labour or not'.  Consequently, the
         test of dependency applied by the judge was incorrect.

The Rule 24 Response

10. On 11 June 2014 Mr Tufan of the Specialist Appeals Team settled a  Rule
    24 response on the part of the respondent, opposing the appeal.   In  a
    comprehensive determination the judge had considered the evidence,  the
    terms of the Regulations and had given adequate reasons  to  find  that
    the appellant was not a dependant of the  sponsor,  who  chose  not  to
    attend the hearing.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

11. At the hearing before me, Mr Eteko developed the  arguments  raised  in
    the grounds of appeal, and drew my attention to  the  passages  in  the
    witness statements of the appellant and the sponsor on which he relied.



Discussion

12. The judge did not direct himself that the relevant test was whether the
    sponsor had been supplying support for the appellant's essential  needs
    for a continuous five-year period.   But  equally  the  judge  did  not
    specially state that the test was whether the appellant was  wholly  or
    mainly financially dependent on  the  sponsor,  and  thus  he  did  not
    specifically misdirect himself  to  the  contrary.   The  judge  simply
    stated that the appellant had to be dependent on the sponsor, and  this
    proposition encompasses de facto dependency as well as a dependency  of
    necessity.  It is also capable  of  encompassing  the  concept  of  the
    sponsor providing support for the appellant's essential  living  needs,
    while not being the main source of such support.

13. If the findings of fact made by the judge disclosed that the test in EU
    law was satisfied, there would plainly be an error  in  his  conclusion
    that the appellant had not discharged the burden of proving dependency.
     But, as submitted by Mr Deller, the judge rejected a crucial aspect of
    the appellant's evidence, which was that the sponsor was giving her �50
    to �100 each month.  The  judge  had  the  benefit  of  receiving  oral
    evidence from the appellant, and he was entitled to reject this  aspect
    of her evidence for the reasons which he gave.  It  is  true  that  the
    sponsor corroborated the appellant's evidence to the  extent  that  she
    said that she continued to provide her  with  financial  support,  even
    after the appellant had  moved  to  her  own  accommodation.   But  the
    sponsor did not give any details.  Moreover, as explained by the judge,
    the documentary evidence before him did  not  establish  the  sponsor's
    ability to "maintain" the appellant.  As the submitted bank  statements
    showed the sponsor's bank account to  be  continuously  overdrawn,  and
    there was no other evidence of her family finances, it  was  reasonable
    for the judge to hold that the sponsor's alleged provision  of  �50  to
    �100 a month in cash to  the  appellant  by  way  of  support  for  her
    essential living needs in London was not credibly demonstrated.

14. Although the thrust of the appellant's witness statement was  that  she
    never had to buy her own food, as she always ate with her daughter, the
    finding by the judge at paragraph 11 of his determination was that  the
    appellant spent much of her time at the sponsor's home -  not  all  the
    time - and that the sponsor gave her food when she  was  there.  So  by
    implication there would be times when the appellant would be buying her
    own food and eating at her own  home.   It  is  not  suggested  in  the
    grounds of appeal that the judge has misrepresented the  oral  evidence
    that was elicited from the appellant on this topic, and  so  there  has
    not been a failure by the judge to take relevant evidence into account.
    Furthermore, when the appellant was at  the  sponsor's  house  she  was
    providing the services of a cook, housekeeper and carer in exchange for
    a benefit in kind (joining in the family meals), and so it was open  to
    the judge not to treat the provision of food to the  appellant  at  the
    sponsor's house as constituting evidence of dependency.

15. Finally, there is nothing wrong in the judge placing weight on the fact
    that the appellant was  in  receipt  of  a  pension  and  other  public
    benefits.  While the receipt of public funds does  not  mean  that  the
    appellant could not also be dependent on the sponsor for  the  purposes
    of the Regulations 2006, the fact that her essential living needs  were
    prima facia being met by the state was and is a relevant  consideration
    in determining the question of whether the sponsor has  been  providing
    support for her essential living needs,  as  opposed  to  providing  no
    support  at  all;  or  merely  providing  support   for   non-essential
    expenditure.

16. There is a  paradox  inherent  in  the  Regulations  that  the  act  of
    recognising a dependent family member under Regulation 7 or 8 is liable
    to create the conditions by which  such  a  right  is  destroyed.   The
    appellant obtained a residence card as the dependent family  member  of
    her daughter, and it is reasonable to infer that  this  residence  card
    enabled her to obtain the pension  credit  and  other  public  benefits
    which she has since enjoyed.   But  at  the  same  time  there  was  in
    consequence at least a partial transfer of responsibility to the  state
    for meeting the appellant's essential living  needs,  thus  potentially
    undermining her status as an EEA family member who is dependent  on  an
    EEA national exercising treaty rights here.  The conundrum  is  touched
    upon in Dauhoo, where it is pointed out that an extended family  member
    (OFM) can  retain  his  status  under  the  Regulations  by  virtue  of
    remaining in the same household as the  sponsor,  even  if  he  or  she
    ceases to be financially dependent on the  sponsor.   A  fortiori,  the
    same  considerations  must  apply  to  a  direct  family  member  under
    Regulation 7.

17. The judge thus rightly considered whether the appellant could  continue
    to qualify as a family member on an  alternative  basis,  namely  as  a
    member of the sponsor's household.  It was open to the  judge  to  find
    that the  appellant  was  not  currently  a  member  of  the  sponsor's
    household, and that she had previously been a member of  the  sponsor's
    household for a continuous period of five years, for the reasons  which
    he gave.

18. There is no challenge by way of appeal to the judge's  finding  on  the
    appellant's alternative claim under Article 8 ECHR.  The judge observed
    that there was no decision to remove  the  appellant  from  the  United
    Kingdom, and accordingly the decision did not interfere with her  right
    to respect for family life.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.
