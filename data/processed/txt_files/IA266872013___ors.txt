Representation:

For the claimants:     Mr  A Vaughan, instructed by AK Solicitors LLP
For the respondent:    Ms H Rackstraw, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Abdul Basher Mohammed Shamim, date of birth 3.1.70,  his
    wife Hosen Ara Begum, date of birth 15.1.68, and their children,  Anika
    Mubashsira Bushra, date of birth 9.11.01, and Kaba Al Shamim,  date  of
    birth 22.1.07, are citizens of Bangladesh.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Duff, who allowed the appeals against  the
    decisions of the respondent to refuse to vary leave to remain in the UK
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and  dependants.  The  appeals  were
    allowed on the basis that the decisions were not in accordance with the
    law and breached the appellants' rights  under  article  8  ECHR.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 28.10.13.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Frances  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    26.11.13.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 31.1.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  I heard submissions and reserved my  decision  on  error  of
    law, which was promulgated to the parties on 18.2.14.

 5. The remaking of the decision was then listed before me on 19.5.14.

 6. At the outset of the hearing before me on 19.5.14, Mr Vaughan sought to
    reopen the error of  law  decision.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal having already been set aside, I declined to reopen the  error
    of law decision.

 7. The matter was heard as linked claimants. Unless  otherwise  stated  or
    clear from the context, all references below to the claimant  refer  to
    the first claimant, Mr Shamim, the Tier 1 (entrepreneur) applicant.

 8. The appeal was also heard together with the Secretary of State's appeal
    against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of  Mr
    Shamim's  entrepreneur   team   partner,   Hari   Krishnan,   reference
    IA/26749/2013. There were two  separate  decisions  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and I  am  asked  to  draft  separate  decisions,  though  the
    reasoning will largely be the same, as they were in the  determinations
    of Judge Duff.

 9. The relevant background can be  summarised  as  follows.  The  claimant
    first entered the UK on 4.9.05 with leave as  a  student  and  extended
    thereafter at a Tier 1 Post Study migrant until 15.12.12.  On  18.12.12
    he made an application  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur), with Mr Hari Krishnan. The application was  refused  on
    the basis of failure of the appellant to  comply  with  the  evidential
    requirements under Appendix A paragraphs 41-SD and  46-SD.  It  is  the
    appeal against that decision which came before Judge Duff.

10. The particular failures relied on by the respondent are as follows:

      a) Insufficient evidence that the  entrepreneurial  team  had  already
         invested �30,000 into the business 'Fairway Business  International
         Ltd;'

      b) The bank letter does not state the claimant's name or that  of  his
         entrepreurial  team  partner,  or  that  the  monies  held  can  be
         transferred to the UK;

      c) The legal representative's letter related to a previous declaration
         and not the one made with the current application. Further, it  did
         not clearly confirm the third  party's  identification  details  or
         their  signature.  The  letter  does  not   come   from   a   legal
         representative who is authorised to practice in the country of  the
         third party;

      d) Insufficient evidence that the  claimant  is  engaged  in  business
         activity. None of the advertisements give the partners names.  None
         of the contracts include a contact telephone number of the  clients
         or original signatures from both parties, or  have  signatures  but
         pages missing from the contracts;

      e) No evidence was submitted to demonstrate that that the business  is
         subject to UK taxation.

11. For the reasons set out herein, I found that there  were  a  number  of
    errors of law in the making of Judge Duff's  decision,  such  that  the
    determination should be set aside and remade. I attach as an  annex  to
    this determination my error of law decision.

12. In summary, I found that:

      a) The First-tier Tribunal wrongly  took  into  account  evidence  not
         submitted with the application;

      b) The First-tier Tribunal wrongly dispensed with the requirements  of
         paragraph 41-SD in relation to PBS specified evidence; and,

      c)  Was in error to find that there was an obligation on the Secretary
         of State to seek missing  information  as  part  of  an  evidential
         flexibility policy (or under paragraph 245AA);

      d)  Was in error in the article 8  assessment  to  consider  that  the
         interference with family life was not necessary for the enforcement
         of  immigration  policy  and  misunderstood  and   misapplied   the
         proportionality balancing exercise;

      e) Wrongly applied a near-miss approach to  the  requirements  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

13. I heard submissions  from  the  representatives  of  both  parties  and
    received Mr Vaughan's skeleton argument and reserved  my  determination
    on the remaking of the decision in the appeal, which I now give.

14. For the reasons given at �12 to �17 of my error of law decision, I  can
    only consider evidence in relation to the  PBS  application  which  was
    submitted with and at the date of application, which  was  18.12.12.  I
    can consider further evidence in relation to article 8 up to  the  date
    of my determination.

15. Since the hearing before me,  there  have  been  a  number  of  further
    relevant decisions of the Upper Tribunal in relation to PBS cases.

16. In Durrani (Entrepreneurs: bank letters; evidential flexibility) [2014]
    UKUT 00295 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

             (1)   The requirements listed in paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) of  the
             Rules are to be construed reasonably and  sensibly,  in  their
             full context.  Approached in this way,  the  letters  required
             from banks or other financial institutions are not designed to
             provide, and do not commit them to, any form of  guarantee  or
             assurance  to  any  party.   Rather,  the  function   of   the
             prescribed letters is to attest to the state of  the  relevant
             bank account on the date when they are written and to  provide
             certain other items of information  designed  to  confirm  the
             authenticity of the application  for  entrepreneurial  migrant
             status and its economic viability.  There is no difficulty  in
             the third party bank, with its customer's consent,  expressing
             its understanding, based on the customer's instructions,  that
             the use of specified funds in the customer's bank account/s is
             contemplated or proposed by the customer for  the  purpose  of
             financing   the   applicant's   proposed   business   venture.
             Accordingly, there is no substance in the  argument  that  the
             relevant  requirements  contained  in  paragraph   41-SD(a)(i)
             produce an absurd result and must, therefore,  be  interpreted
             in some other manner.

              (2)    The question of whether a  policy  exists  is  one  of
             fact.  There is no evidence that  some  policy  on  evidential
             flexibility, independent and freestanding of paragraph  245AA,
             survived the introduction of that paragraph in the immigration
             rules.

17. In Akhter and another (paragraph 245AA: wrong format) [2014] UKUT 00297
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal Tribunal held that a bank letter, which  does
    not specify the postal address, landline  telephone  number  and  email
    address of the account holders is not thereby "in the wrong format" for
    the purposes of paragraph 245AA of the immigration rules (documents not
    submitted with applications).

18. In relation to  the  issues  in  this  appeal,  it  is  clear  that  no
    flexibility policy survived the introduction  of  paragraph  245AA  and
    that that limitations of that paragraph cannot be expanded  to  include
    defective documents as being  in  the  wrong  format.  The  above  case
    authorities entirely support my decision in relation to the application
    of evidential flexibility set out between �19 and �31 of that decision.



19. For the reasons set out in the error of law decision,  without  needing
    to repeat them here, it is clear that the claimants  do  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for leave to  remain  as  Tier  1
    entrepreneur and dependents and their appeals in that regard must fail.
    Mr Vaughan made no submissions to the contrary.

20. Developing  his  skeleton  argument,  Mr  Vaughan  submitted  that  the
    appellants should succeed under the Immigration  Rules,  on  the  basis
    that one or both children qualify under private  life  under  paragraph
    276ADE (1)(iv) and thus the parents (and the  other  child)  should  be
    entitled to remain under article 8 to care for those  children.  It  is
    submitted that the best interests of the children are to remain in  the
    UK and for the children to be raised by the parents.

21. I have a duty to have  regard  as  a  primary  consideration  the  best
    interests of the child claimants. In Azimi-Moayed &  others  (decisions
    affecting children; onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197 (IAC), the  Upper
    Tribunal Tribunal held that as a starting  point  it  is  in  the  best
    interests of the children to  be  with  both  their  parents,  "Lengthy
    residence in a country other than the  state  of  origin  can  lead  to
    development of social cultural and educational ties that  it  would  be
    inappropriate to disrupt, in the absence of compelling reasons  to  the
    contrary. What amounts to lengthy residence is not clear but  past  and
    present policies have identified seven years as a relevant period."

22. The Tribunal also noted that seven years from age four is likely to  be
    more significant to a child than the first seven years  of  life.  Very
    young children are focussed on their parents rather  than  their  peers
    and are adaptable.

23. The claimant Anika Bushra has spent her life in the UK since age 4  and
    will be 13 years of age in November 2014. She has thus spent  something
    over  8  years  in  the  UK.  Under  276ADE(iv)  she  has  thus   lived
    continuously in the UK for at least 7 years.

24. Mr Vaughan submitted that Bushra would experience a real  detriment  to
    her life to have to return to Bangladesh and that it was  in  her  best
    interests to continue with her course of education in the UK.  In  that
    regard I take into account the evidence of her integration with life in
    the UK, including the letters of Bushra, Kaba, and  their  father,  and
    the school reports and teacher comments,  set  out  in  the  claimants'
    bundle. Bushra started secondary school in September 2013. All  of  the
    evidence is positive in support of the children, though perhaps no more
    than one might expect from being  enrolled  in  school  and  taking  an
    active part in school life. I also take into account  that  the  family
    can be  adequately  accommodated  and  maintained  in  the  UK  without
    reliance on public funds.

25. The second child, Kaba is now 7 years of age and was born  in  the  UK.
    Thus both children have been in the UK for 7 or  more  years  and  will
    have by now integrated well into  their  school  communities,  more  so
    Bushra than Kaba. Bushra will  have  little  recollection  of  life  in
    Bangladesh and Kaba has known nothing but  life  in  UK,  although  the
    majority of that will have been within the family.

26. In Azimi the Tribunal said that, "it is generally in the  interests  of
    children  to  have  both  stability  and  continuity  of   social   and
    educational provision and the benefit of growing  up  in  the  cultural
    norms of the society to which they belong." Whilst  the  children  will
    have had the advantage of education to date in  the  UK,  children  can
    adapt quickly to new  environments  and  the  challenges  of  that  are
    mitigated by having the whole family together and  the  familiarity  of
    the parents of the culture and society to which they are returning. The
    cultural norms and background to which the children belong is  that  of
    their parents which must be the  society  and  culture  of  their  home
    country  of  Bangladesh.  I  accept  that  that  could  potentially  be
    outweighed by particular circumstances, as anticipated in Azimi.

27. Obviously, the family must  remain  together,  whether  in  the  UK  or
    Bangladesh and there is no basis  for  splitting  children  or  parents
    apart. It would be unreasonable to require one child to return  without
    the other. It follows that if one of the children is entitled to remain
    in the UK, then the other child and both  parents  should  remain  with
    that child.

28. I have to bear in mind the context of the application at the  heart  of
    this appeal was to remain as a Tier 1 entrepreneur and  dependents  and
    that application has failed. The only basis for the wife  and  children
    to remain stood or fell with that of the husband and first claimant. As
    neither he nor his wife have  independent  grounds  to  remain,  having
    failed to comply with the Immigration Rules, one would expect the first
    claimant to leave and for his dependents to follow.

29. Further, seven years residence in the UK is not the sole test  for  the
    children. The crucial issue on the facts of this appeal is  whether  it
    would be reasonable to expect the children to leave the UK  with  their
    parents.

30. In Azimi the Tribunal held that, "if both  parents  are  being  removed
    from the UK then the starting point suggests that so  should  dependent
    children who form part of their household unless there are  reasons  to
    the contrary." That starting point has to be considered alongside  that
    part of 276ADE which provides that for leave to remain it must  not  be
    reasonable to expect the applicant under the age of 18 to leave the UK.
    Obviously, if  the  7  years  residence  of  a  period  under  18  were
    sufficient, there would be no need for the reasonableness test.

31. Thus the question in  this  appeal,  taking  an  overall  view  of  the
    evidence of the integration of the children through  schooling  in  the
    UK, is whether it would be reasonable to expect children  of  a  failed
    Tier 1 entrepreneur to accompany  their  parents  back  to  Bangladesh,
    taking account of not only the length of residence  but  those  factors
    set out above and urged upon me by Mr Vaughan. Despite  the  degree  of
    integration as evidenced and the family's  personal  desire  to  remain
    indefinitely in the UK, I find that it would be reasonable on the facts
    of this case to expect the children to accompany their parents back  to
    Bangladesh. Their presence in the UK was only temporary and the  family
    would have known throughout that it depended entirely  on  whether  the
    father qualified for leave to remain as a Tier 1 entrepreneur or in any
    other  route  for  which  he  may  qualify.  There  was  no  legitimate
    expectation to remain outside the Immigration Rules. In many ways  this
    would be akin  to  the  situation  of  a  parent  on  a  government  or
    commercial overseas posting for a number of years before  returning  to
    their home country. The cultural background would have persisted in the
    family home, including native language.

32. I find in all the circumstances it not reasonable to suggest  that  the
    entire family should be entitled to remain because  whilst  the  family
    was in the UK one (if not both)  of  the  children  has  coincidentally
    developed a private life by being educated in the British school system
    and done well at school, developed friendships, and in the process lost
    all recollection of life in their home  country.  Broken  down  to  the
    individual child, I reach the  conclusion,  for  the  reasons  set  out
    herein, that it would be reasonable to expect each of the  children  to
    leave the UK and by doing  so  accompany  their  parents  who  have  no
    individual right to remain.

33. Mr  Vaughan  accepted  that  the  parents  do  not  qualify  under  the
    relationship requirements of Appendix FM for leave to remain either  as
    partners or as parents of a child in the UK. It is of no assistance  to
    the  claimants  to  suggest  that  they  would  have  met   the   other
    requirements, as there is no near miss principle in immigration law.  I
    reject the submission that their closeness to meeting the  requirements
    is relevant to proportionality, as that is simply putting a  near  miss
    argument in a different way. I dealt with the  near-miss  point  in  my
    decision on error of law, at �44 to �49 and do not need  to  repeat  it
    here. The claimants' article 8 claim  cannot  be  strengthened  by  the
    degree to which they fail to meet the Immigration Rules, or as  it  was
    put in Miah, "the requirements of immigration control is  not  weakened
    by the degree of non-compliance with the Immigration Rules."

34. Mr Vaughan's remaining argument is that the Tribunal should  go  on  to
    consider article 8 ECHR  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  because  the
    claimants have shown an arguable case to do so. I referred in the error
    of law decision to Gulshan in the Upper Tribunal and MF(Nigeria) in the
    Court of Appeal. In essence, after applying the Rules,  only  if  there
    may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  them
    is it necessary for article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider  whether
    there are compelling  circumstances  not  sufficient  recognised  under
    them.

35. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

    (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to identify  in  her
         decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does not
         prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis  of
         the materials before it.

     (ii)  "Maintenance of effective immigration  control"  whilst  not  as
         such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR  can  normally
         be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of  disorder  or
         crime" or an aspect of "economic  well-being  of  the  country"  or
         both.

     (iii)  "[P]revention of disorder or crime" is  normally  a  legitimate
         aim both in expulsion cases where there has been  criminal  conduct
         on the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases where there have
         only been breaches of immigration law.

     (iv)  MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 held that the new  immigration
         rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal  are  a  complete
         code. This was because  of  the  express  requirement  in  them  at
         paragraph 398 to have regard to exceptional circumstances and other
         factors.

     (v)    It follows from this that any other rule which  has  a  similar
         provision will also constitute a complete code;

     (vi)  Where an area of  the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

36. Having applied the Immigration Rules and found that  the  claimants  do
    not meet the requirements of the Rules, I have considered whether  they
    can be regarded as a complete code. In respect of the  child  claimants
    the requirement under 276ADE to consider reasonableness is in essence a
    proportionality assessment. I have to bear in mind that the Immigration
    Rules including Appendix FM is the Secretary  of  State's  response  to
    private and family life rights and the best interests of  children  and
    are intended to be a complete code. However, because the parents do not
    meet the requirements of either 276ADE or the relationship requirements
    of  Appendix  FM,  there  has  been  no  separate  assessment  of   the
    proportionality of  their  removal.  Thus  following  Shahzad,  I  must
    consider, at least in  relation  to  the  parents,  whether  there  are
    arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the  Rules,
    so that it is  necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider
    whether,  exceptionally,  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
    sufficiently recognised under the Rules, on the basis that the decision
    of the Secretary of State produces  a  result  which  is  unjustifiably
    harsh (Nagre).

37. However, taking full account of all the  matters  urged  on  me  and/or
    disclosed in the appellant's bundle or other documents before me, I  am
    not satisfied that there are good grounds for granting leave to  remain
    outside  the  Rules.   I   do   not   find   compelling   circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the Rules which render the decision of the
    Secretary of State unjustifiably harsh.

38. In reaching that view, I take into account  all  the  matters  set  out
    herein and urged upon me by Mr Vaughan, especially in relation  to  the
    schooling and degree of integration of the children  and  the  family's
    length of residence in the  UK.  I  bear  in  mind  that  there  is  no
    consideration of proportionality but in effect  the  requirement  under
    the caselaw  to  demonstrate  compelling  circumstances  rendering  the
    decision unjustifiably harsh is a proportionality  test  and  can  take
    into account the best interest of the children, which I do. However,  I
    have found that the children do not meet the requirements of 276ADE  in
    respect of their private life and any  compelling  circumstances  would
    have to relate to  their  private  life,  as  their  family  life  will
    continue with their parents, as the family will be removed together. In
    the circumstances, the failure of the children to meet 276ADE does  not
    assist the claim of the parents to remain under article 8 family life.

39. In considering whether  the  family's  circumstances  are  insufficient
    recognised in the Immigration Rules, I have to bear in mind that  there
    is a route for leave to  remain  for  the  children  under  276ADE,  as
    discussed above, and that the Rules specifically do not provide  for  a
    right to remain for parents of children where both parents are together
    caring for children who are neither British nor settled in the UK. That
    is itself in part a proportionality assessment of what can be  regarded
    as giving potential rise to a right to remain. If parents do  not  meet
    those requirements  of  Appendix  FM  then  the  Secretary  of  State's
    position is that they have no right to remain. That does  not  prevent,
    however, consideration of their private and family  life  rights  under
    article 8 ECHR outside the Rules, but only if their  circumstances  are
    both compelling and so insufficiently recognised under the  Rules  that
    the decision to remove can be regarded as unjustifiably harsh. For  the
    reasons set out herein, I find that the claimants' circumstances do not
    meet either the requirements of the Immigration Rules or of the  recent
    caselaw providing protection where the circumstances are insufficiently
    recognised in the Rules.

40. I am required to take into account the fact that the  family  does  not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  for  leave  to  remain,
    even though there is a route for leave to remain for those  in  similar
    circumstances, provided that they can meet all the requirements of  the
    Rules. I bear in mind the nature and purpose of the application made by
    the first claimant and the rest of the family as his dependants,  which
    was as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur. The family had no legitimate  expectation
    to remain in the UK beyond qualifying to do so under  those  provisions
    of the Immigration Rules. They have no right to remain  simply  because
    they prefer to settle in the UK or simply  because  of  the  elapse  of
    time. I also have to take account of the fact that the  Rules  and  the
    2002 Act are  designed  to  require  applicants  to  provide  specified
    evidence with the application and  that  evidence  or  other  documents
    submitted after the application cannot be taken into account except and
    insofar as paragraph 245AA applies. The Rules for leave  to  remain  in
    this category are intentionally quite strict and thus the effect of non-
    compliance is stark.

41. In Gulshan the Upper Tribunal considered that it was not  unduly  harsh
    for a husband who originated  from  Pakistan  but  was  now  a  British
    national, to return to Bangladesh with his wife who was  seeking  leave
    to remain as his spouse. The panel acknowledged that the  couple  would
    suffer some hardship, as he had been in  the  UK  since  2002,  he  had
    worked here and was receiving a pension, and housing benefit and  other
    state benefits, some of which could not  be  transferred  to  Pakistan.
    Whilst this family's circumstances are different, the Upper  Tribunal's
    decision on what was not unjustifiably harsh is  illustrative  of  that
    test.

42. Mr Vaughan asked me to consider  that  the  claimants  were  running  a
    business, employing two staff members and contribution to the  economy.
    However, the evidence showed that the business was making  a  loss  and
    there was very little reliable evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal
    to show that the business was or would be successful. I also note  that
    a qualified chartered accountant did not audit  the  accounts.  I  also
    have to bear in mind that the entrepreneurial team partner  has  failed
    to demonstrate that he can meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and has failed to make out  any  valid  claim  on  the  basis  of
    article 8; it is difficult to  see  how  the  business  could  continue
    without that partner's contribution. The evidence demonstrated that the
    business was fragile. It if failed  the  claimants  would  then  become
    dependent on the public purse.

43. In the circumstances, taken at best, the running of the business  is  a
    neutral factor in the assessment of compelling  circumstances.  At  the
    First-tier Tribunal the claimants asserted that they could  not  return
    to Bangladesh because  they  had  put  everything  into  the  business.
    However, that is neither compelling circumstances nor  a  valid  reason
    not to remove.

44. In essence, the only circumstances in this case  which  could  ever  be
    considered compelling are those  outlined  above  in  relation  to  the
    children; summarised as their length of residence  and  integration  in
    schooling and friendships revolving around their private  lives.  I  am
    satisfied that the claimed likely disruption to their lives is  not  as
    great as claimed, bearing in mind that they will have  the  support  of
    their parents and the whole family as a unit returning  together.  They
    will have no linguistic difficulties and the culture will  be  familiar
    to them. Children are young enough  to  quickly  adjust  and  make  new
    friendships. There is no  evidence  that  they  will  not  be  able  to
    continue schooling. Their family circumstances are  of  a  middle-class
    Bangladeshi family with good education and the advantage of English  as
    a second language. Their education to date in the UK will be a positive
    benefit to their future advantage. Taken as a  whole,  I  am  satisfied
    that the best interests of the children will be to  remain  with  their
    parents as a complete family unit. I do not accept  the  argument  that
    their best interests are to remain in the  UK.  Obviously,  they  would
    prefer to remain in the UK indefinitely and to continue to be  educated
    in the UK. Whilst that lifestyle is inevitably going to be superior  to
    that available to the family in Bangladesh, that is not the same  thing
    as saying their best interests are to remain in the UK.  Otherwise  the
    best interests of every child would be to have the best of  everything.
    It is an assessment that has to be made in the context of the case as a
    whole and in this case in the light of the fact that the  parents  have
    no right to remain, then it is in  the  children's  best  interests  to
    return with their parents. That is why it is not unreasonable to expect
    them to do so.

45. In all the circumstances, taking the evidence as a whole, in the round,
    I  find  that  there  are  no  sufficiently  compelling   circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules so  as  to  justify,
    exceptionally, granting leave to remain outside the  Immigration  Rules
    under article 8 ECHR on the basis that the decision of the Secretary of
    State is unjustifiably harsh. For those reasons the appeals must fail.

Decision:

The appeal of each appellant is dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in

Representation:

For the claimants:     Mr  R  Reynolds, instructed by AK Solicitors LLP
For the respondent:    Mr Mangion, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

46. The claimants, Abdul Basher Mohammed Shamim, date of birth 3.1.70,  his
    wife Hosen Ara Begum, date of birth 15.1.68, and their children,  Anika
    Mubashsira Bushra, date of birth 9.11.01, and Kaba Al Shamim,  date  of
    birth 22.1.07, are citizens of Bangladesh.

47. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Duff, who allowed the appeals against  the
    decisions of the respondent to refuse to vary leave to remain in the UK
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and  dependants.  The  appeals  were
    allowed on the basis that the decisions were not in accordance with the
    law and breached the appellants' rights  under  article  8  ECHR.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 28.10.13.

48. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Frances  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    26.11.13.

49. Thus the matter came before me on 31.1.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

50. The matter was heard as linked claimants. Unless  otherwise  stated  or
    clear from the context, all references below to the claimant  refer  to
    the first claimant, Mr Shamim, the Tier 1 (entrepreneur) applicant.

51. The appeal was also heard together with the Secretary of State's appeal
    against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of  Mr
    Shamim's  entrepreneur   team   partner,   Hari   Krishnan,   reference
    IA/26749/2013. There were two  separate  decisions  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and I  am  asked  to  draft  separate  decisions,  though  the
    reasoning will largely be the same, as they were in the  determinations
    of Judge Duff.

Error of Law

52. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Duff should be set aside.

53. Following the submissions of the representatives on the issue of  error
    of law, I reserved my decision, which I now give.

54. The relevant background can be  summarised  as  follows.  The  claimant
    first entered the UK on 4.9.05 with leave as  a  student  and  extended
    thereafter at a Tier 1 Post Study migrant until 15.12.12.  On  18.12.12
    he made an application  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur), with Mr Hari Krishnan. The application was  refused  on
    the basis of failure of the appellant to  comply  with  the  evidential
    requirements under Appendix A paragraphs 41-SD and  46-SD.  It  is  the
    appeal against that decision which came before Judge Duff.

55. The particular failures relied on by the respondent are as follows:

      a) Insufficient evidence that the  entrepreneurial  team  had  already
         invested �30,000 into the business 'Fairway Business  International
         Ltd;'

      b) The bank letter does not state the claimant's name or that  of  his
         entrepreurial  team  partner,  or  that  the  monies  held  can  be
         transferred to the UK;

      c) The legal representative's letter related to a previous declaration
         and not the one made with the current application. Further, it  did
         not clearly confirm the third party's  identificateion  details  or
         their  signature.  The  letter  does  not   come   from   a   legal
         representative who is authorised to practice in the country of  the
         third party;

      d) Insufficient evidence that the  claimant  is  engaged  in  business
         activity. None of the advertisements give the partners names.  None
         of the contracts include a contact telephone number of the  clients
         or original signatures from both parties, or  have  signatures  but
         pages missing from the contracts;

      e) No evidence was submitted to demonstrate that that the business  is
         subject to UK taxation.

56. For the reasons set out herein, I find that  there  were  a  number  of
    errors of law in the making of Judge Duff's  decision,  such  that  the
    determination should be set aside and remade.

57. Judge Duff noted the evidential failures at �7 of the determination. At
    �2  the  judge  recognised  that  by  reason  of  section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  only  evidence  submitted
    with the application could be considered in a PBS case. The application
    was made on 18.12.12 and the refusal decisions followed on 14.6.13.  At
    �11 Judge Duff noted the claimant's reliance on  further  documentation
    submitted after the date of application and concluded at  �12  and  �14
    that the Secretary of State had failed  to  take  account  of  all  the
    evidence submitted, "as it ought to have been." For the reasons set out
    below, I find that to be an error of law.

58. As drafted, section 85A provides that when considering a PBS appeal the
    Tribunal may consider evidence adduced by the appellant only if it  was
    submitted in support of, and at the time of making, the application  to
    which the immigration decision related. Immigration Rule  34G  provides
    that an application is made on  the  date  it  is  sent  or  submitted,
    depending on how it is submitted.


59. Previous authority suggesting that an application  remains  open  until
    the date of decision has been overturned. In Raju, Khatel and Others  v
    SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 754 the Court of Appeal  made  it  clear  that  AQ
    (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2011] EWCA Civ 833 was,  "not  authority  for  the
    proposition... that applications  were  "made"  throughout  the  period
    starting with the date of their submission and finishing with the  date
    of the decisions".  Rule 37 of the Immigration Rules governs  the  date
    of  the  application.  Paragraph  34G  precludes  the  concept   of   a
    'continuing application' which started when it was first submitted  and
    concluded at the date of the decision either of the Secretary of  State
    or, on appeal, of a Tribunal.


60. Despite the apparent effect of section 85A, in Nasim and others  (Raju:
    reasons not to follow?) [2013]  UKUT  00610(IAC),  the  Upper  Tribunal
    stated, inter alia,

         " As  held  in  Khatel  and  others  (s85A;  effect  of  continuing
         application)  [2013]  UKUT  00044  (IAC),  section   85A   of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 precludes a  tribunal,
         in  a  points-based  appeal,  from  considering  evidence   as   to
         compliance with points-based Rules, where  that  evidence  was  not
         before the Secretary of State when she took her decision;  but  the
         section does not prevent a tribunal from considering evidence  that
         was before the Secretary of  State  when  she  took  the  decision,
         whether or not that evidence reached her only  after  the  date  of
         application for the purposes of paragraph 34F  of  the  Immigration
         Rules."

61. At �76 of Nasim, it is clear that this view was obiter and not part  of
    the rationale for the decision.  However, it appears from �73 that  the
    respondent's position before the Upper Tribunal was that an application
    is to be treated as continuing for  evidential  purposes  after  it  is
    initially submitted to the  SSHD,  enabling  an  applicant  to  provide
    further evidence in addition to that  initially  submitted.  There  may
    have been a particular reason for such a concession in that appeal  and
    it may be a matter entirely restricted to that  case.  However,  whilst
    the respondent could consider evidence  submitted  after  the  date  of
    application, the Tribunal cannot as it is clearly prohibited from doing
    so by 85A(4); I can find no authority to the contrary.


62. Paragraph 245AA was not considered in Nasim, as that case dealt with  a
    different set of criteria for the now-closed post study work route at a
    time before paragraph 245AA was introduced into the Rules in  September
    2012.


63. In the circumstances, I find that there was an error of  law  in  Judge
    Duff taking into account evidence that  was  before  the  Secretary  of
    State before she made her decision, and not taken into account by  her,
    as such evidence had not been submitted with the application.

64. Further, at �15 of the determination Judge Duff  purports  to  dispense
    with the requirements  of  41-SD  in  relation  to  the  advertisements
    submitted as evidence of engagement in business activity, finding that,
    "the material taken together satisfied the  requirement."  The  judge's
    opinion  that  it  would  make  no  commercial  sense   for   published
    advertisements to have  the  claimant's  name,  or  that  of  his  team
    partner, as opposed to the name of the  business  is  irrelevant.   The
    specific requirement in 41-SD (c)(iii) is that the  advertisement  must
    contain, "the applicant's  name  (and  the  name  of  the  business  if
    applicable) together with the business activity." It is not open to the
    First-tier Tribunal to dispense with the stated requirements; to do  so
    is a clear error  of  law.  I  will  deal  below  with  the  evidential
    flexibility point made in the alternative in �15.

65. At �16 the judge accepted that none of the contracts had the  telephone
    numbers of the clients on  them.  At  �17  the  judge  notes  that  the
    claimant accepts failing  to  provide  the  required  evidence  of  tax
    registration. At �19  Judge  Duff  finds  that  because  of  these  two
    evidential failures, described as "minor aspects  of  the  rules,"  the
    appeal cannot be allowed on the basis that the application was  not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules. However, he proceeded  to  allow
    the appeal on the basis that the decisions were not in accordance  with
    the law on the following basis set out in the determination at �17  and
    �19:

66. That the evidential failures, "ought to have prompted the Secretary  of
    State to make an enquiry of the claimant  pursuant  to  the  evidential
    flexibility  policy  in  existence  at  that   time...   A   caseworker
    considering the case clearly ought to have  had  sufficient  reason  to
    believe that the missing piece of evidence existed or at the  least  to
    have been uncertain as to whether it existed  and  to  have  given  the
    benefit of the doubt  to  the  (claimant)  and  requested  the  missing
    material."

67. For the reasons set out below, I find that Judge Duff made an error  of
    law in reliance on evidential flexibility to allow the appeals.

68. In relation to the evidential flexibility policy, in  Alam  and  others
    [2012] EWCA Civ 960 the Court of Appeal held that the exclusion of  new
    evidence introduced by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    s.85A applied to all appeals made after the date that s.85A was brought
    into force. The Court accepted the  Respondent's  contention  that  the
    check as to the validity of applications was a very  preliminary  check
    to see whether there were obvious  omissions:  e.g.  no  fee  paid,  no
    photograph supplied, no signature on the Student Declaration at the end
    of the form. The Court of Appeal accepted the  distinction  between  an
    invalid application, which would not be considered unless  the  obvious
    defect was cured, and an application that was a valid application,  but
    nevertheless fell to be rejected because, on examination, the applicant
    had failed to score that required number of points, e.g. because he had
    failed  to  supply  a  specified  document.   In   the   circumstances,
    irrespective of any argument as to whether submitted documents were  in
    the  wrong  format,  the  failure  to  provide  a  specified  document,
    including  in  this  case  the  contracts,   advertisements   and   tax
    registration, were omissions fatal to the application.


69. Judge Duff relied on Rodriquez (Flexibility Policy) [2013]  UKUT  00042
    (IAC). However, Rodriquez  was  further  considered  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal, Rodriquez [2014] EWCA Civ 2, where the  court  almost  entirely
    disagreed with  the  conclusions  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  as  to  the
    applicability of an evidential flexibility  policy  to  PBS  cases.  Ms
    Rodriguez had failed to demonstrate by  her  submitted  bank  statement
    that she had the necessary funds over the required  28-day  period  and
    her application for further leave to remain as a student  was  refused.
    The First-tier Tribunal decided that pursuant to section 85A  it  could
    not take account of further bank statements showing  additional  funds.
    She then appealed to the  Upper  Tribunal,  relying  on  an  evidential
    flexibility policy in a letter dated 19.5.11.

70. It should be pointed out that in Rodriguez, the incorporation  of  what
    was the evidential flexibility policy into  the  Immigration  Rules  at
    paragraph 245AA was not directly material to the three  appeals  before
    the Court of Appeal, as it came about after  the  relevant  dates.  The
    Court of Appeal was  considering  the  contention  that  an  evidential
    flexibility  policy,  referred  to  as  the  PBS  Process  Instruction,
    published in June 2011, was the version  potentially  relevant  to  the
    three appeals before the court. The document appears as Appendix  B  to
    the Upper Tribunal Rodriguez decision.

71. The Court of Appeal found that the letter of 19.5.11 was  not  intended
    to herald an unequivocal relaxation of the Immigration Rules  over  and
    above the process instruction; it was merely  referential  to  existing
    policy and mooting a temporary trial. At �92, it was  held  that  taken
    overall, the process instruction,  "is  demonstrably  not  designed  to
    given an applicant the  opportunity  first  to  remedy  any  defect  or
    inadequacy in the application or supporting documentation so as to save
    the application from refusal after substantive  consideration."  In  Ms
    Rodriguez case there was no reason to believe that she had other  funds
    available to her and she had not met the requirements of the  Rules  in
    that she failed to  submit  the  specified  documentation  showing  the
    required minimum amount over the 28 day period required.  Consideration
    of the policy did not and would not have  assisted  Ms  Rodriguez.  The
    court found that the conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal in her  case
    was correct.

72. The PBS Process Instruction policy, predating paragraph 245AA, purports
    to deal with missing evidence or a minor error. It states, inter  alia,
    that there is no limit  on  the  amount  of  information  that  can  be
    requested from the applicant; that multiple pieces of evidence  can  be
    requested; and that where there is uncertainty as to  whether  evidence
    exists, benefit should be given to the  applicant.  At  section  3,  it
    provides  that  before  seeking  additional  information,  it  must  be
    established that the evidence exists, or sufficient reason  to  believe
    that it exists.

73. In any event, by the time of the facts in the present appeal,  the  PBS
    Process Instruction had been incorporated into the Immigration Rules on
    6.9.12 in paragraph 245AA, setting out that  only  documents  submitted
    with the application will be considered and  that  documents  submitted
    after the application will only be considered in certain  circumstances
    where 245AA(b) applies.  This  relates  to  a  missing  document  in  a
    sequence, or a document in the wrong format, or the supply  of  a  copy
    instead of the  original.  "The  UK  Border  Agency  will  not  request
    documents where a specified document has not been submitted,  or  where
    the UK Border Agency does not anticipate that addressing  the  omission
    or error ... will lead to a  grant  because  the  application  will  be
    refused for other reasons."

74. The examples set out at step 3 of the process instruction are virtually
    identical to paragraph 245AA as it stood  in  September  2012.  In  the
    circumstances, I find no significant difference in the  application  of
    the policy between this document and paragraph 245AA of the Immigration
    Rules. In any event, neither the application of the process instruction
    nor paragraph 245AA could rescue the several evidential failures in the
    present case. In the circumstances, it is not  necessary  to  determine
    whether paragraph 245AA displaces the process instructions.

75. It is obvious that an error in a contract document cannot be  cured  in
    the same way as a missing document in a series or failure to provide an
    original document rather than a copy, as that would mean  the  creation
    of an entirely new contract document. Similarly, an advertisement  that
    does not contain the correct information  cannot  be  cured  without  a
    completely new advertisement. There was thus no basis  for  considering
    there might be evidence in existence in relation to  these  two  issues
    that met the requirements of the Rules. Further, the failure to provide
    the correct document to evidence that the business  is  subject  to  UK
    taxation does not falls within  the  types  of  documents  set  out  in
    245AA(b) or the process instruction. This  was  not  an  error  in  the
    documentation supplied but a complete failure to provide  the  required
    documentation  to  meet  this  part  of  the   requirements.   In   the
    circumstances, there was no requirement for the Secretary of  State  to
    make further enquiries  of  the  claimant  in  relation  any  of  these
    evidential failures.

76. In summary, the claimant's case is not assisted  by  considerations  of
    evidential flexibility. If follows that Judge  Duff  erred  in  law  in
    concluding that the appeal should be allowed on that basis.

77. Judge Duff went on  to  consider  the  claimant's  circumstances  under
    article 8. However, as Mr Reynolds accepts, if the Secretary of State's
    decision were not in accordance with the law,  Judge  Duff  should  not
    have gone on to consider article 8 but should have allowed the  appeals
    to the limited extent that it remained for the Secretary  of  State  to
    make decisions that were in accordance with the law. Thus, even on  the
    claimant's there was an error of law in the decision of Judge Duff such
    that the determination cannot stand.

78. I turn now to article 8 considerations. The First-tier Tribunal allowed
    the appeals on the basis of article 8 family and private life.

79. Article 8 provides that:

           "Everyone has the right to respect for his  private  and  family
           life, his home and his correspondence.


           "There shall be no interference by a public authority  with  the
           exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with  the
           law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
           national security, public safety or the economic  well-being  of
           the country, for the prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others."


80. At paragraph 17 of Razgar v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2004] UKHL 27, Lord Bingham of Cornhill stated:


           "In considering whether a challenge to the Secretary of  State's
           decision to remove a person must  clearly  fail,  the  reviewing
           court must, as it seems to me, consider how an appeal  would  be
           likely  to  fare  before  an  adjudicator,   as   the   Tribunal
           responsible for deciding the appeal if  there  were  an  appeal.
           This means that the reviewing court must ask itself  essentially
           the questions which would have to be answered by an adjudicator.
           In a case where removal is resisted in reliance  on  Article  8,
           these questions are likely to be:

                  (1) Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a
                 public body with the exercise of the applicant's  right  to
                 respect for his private or (as  the  case  may  be)  family
                 life?
                 (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such
                 gravity as potentially to engage the operation  of  Article
                 8?
                  (3) If so, is such interference  in  accordance  with  the
                 law?

                  (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic
                 society in  the  interests  of  national  security,  public
                 safety or the economic well-being of the country,  for  the
                 prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
                 health or morals, or for the protection of the  rights  and
                 freedoms of others?


                  (5) If so,  is  such  interference  proportionate  to  the
                 legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"


81. Following Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules  -  correct  approach)  [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC)  it  is  clear  that  on  the  current  state  of  the
    authorities:

         "After applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may be
         arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside them  is
         it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to  consider  whether
         there are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised
         under them: R (on the application of) Nagre v  Secretary  of  State
         for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);"

82. Broadly speaking MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and Nagre make clear
    that the  Immigration  Rules  as  now  in  force  are  to  be  read  as
    incorporating Article 8 of  the  ECHR  but,  of  course,  the  existing
    jurisprudence continues to bind the decision maker and  the  courts  in
    its interpretation of those  Immigration  Rules.  Put  another  way,  a
    decision purporting to be made in compliance with the Rules  will  only
    be sustainable if it is reconcilable with  those  legal  principles  as
    well as the structure of the Rules itself. Otherwise the decision maker
    will have failed to apply the respondent's policy that refusal  of  the
    application must not result in unjustifiably harsh consequences such as
    to be disproportionate under Article 8. Only  if  there  were  arguably
    good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the rules would it be
    necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to  consider  whether  there
    were compelling circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
    Rules.

83. Judge Duff considered  at  �20  the  circumstances  of  the  claimants,
    pointing out that the family is settled  in  the  UK  with  substantial
    roots including the business. The  two  children  are  well-settled  in
    school and making good progress. The judge concluded that the  claimant
    was running a genuine business and there was nothing at all  about  the
    claimants that was detrimental to the UK. The judge concluded  that  to
    uproot them all and force them to return to  Bangladesh  because  of  a
    minimal failure to comply with aspects of  the  Immigration  Rules  was
    wholly disproportionate.

84. It is to be noted that the claimant has been  in  the  UK  since  2005,
    first as a student and then a post study work migrant.

85. Taking full account of those matters recited by Judge  Duff  and  other
    matters evident in the case papers before  me,  I  find  no  compelling
    circumstances, for granting leave to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules on  the  facts  of  this  appeal.  Neither  do  I  find  evidence
    sufficient  to  render  the   decision   either   disproportionate   or
    unjustifiably harsh; whichever test  is  applied.  There  were  clearly
    stated rules for leave to remain,  with  which  the  claimant  has  not
    complied. The claimants must be taken to understand that they  have  no
    inherent right to remain in the UK unless and  until  they  can  comply
    with the Immigration Rules for doing so.

86. In his article 8 considerations, Judge  Duff  referred  to  the  Razgar
    steps in considering article 8, but found that the interference was not
    necessary for the enforcement of immigration policy. With respect, that
    was a misunderstanding and misconstruction  of  the  Razgar  steps.  In
    essence, the judge conflated the necessity of protecting  the  economic
    well-being of the country with the proportionality  balancing  exercise
    and in doing so made a material error of law.

87. The judge then went on to  consider  at  �20  that  he  had,  "not  the
    slightest doubt that the  decision  was  entirely  disproportionate  in
    relation to the trivial failures in respect of the immigration  rules,"
    and purported to additionally allow the appeal on that basis. The judge
    entirely failed to take into account in the balancing exercise the very
    significant factors weighing in favour  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision,  including  that  the  claimant  had  failed  to   meet   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for leave to remain  in  the  UK.
    The judge erred in concluding which provisions of  the  Rules  had  not
    been complied with. The judge, also  wrongly,  took  into  account  his
    conclusion that the claimant should have been given the opportunity  to
    correct what he described as a  minimal  failure  to  comply  with  two
    trivial aspects of the Immigration Rules.

88. Once one  strips  out  the  errors  of  law  from  the  proportionality
    assessment, there remains little in favour of permitting  the  claimant
    leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules.  In  the  circumstances,
    without needing to elaborate further, it is clear that  the  article  8
    proportionality assessment, if such was required at  all,  was  fatally
    flawed.

89. Further, on  the  present  case,  whilst  the  evidence  that  did  not
    accompany the  application  and  was  excluded  from  consideration  in
    respect of the  Rules,  could  potentially  be  brought  into  play  in
    relation to article 8, it does little to strengthen such an  article  8
    claim, as the claimant is not entitled  to  succeed  on  the  basis  of
    article 8 simply  by  the  degree  to  which  he  failed  to  meet  the
    Immigration Rules.


90. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Frances  also  noted  that  the
    grounds submitted that, following Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261, the  First-
    tier Tribunal wrongly applied the Near-miss principle in the assessment
    of proportionality.

91. "It is arguable that the  judge  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
    Evidential Flexibility Policy applied and it was unfair not to give the
    First (claimant) an opportunity to correct the omission, given that the
    first (claimant) had failed to  supply  specified  documents.  Further,
    contrary to Miah, the judge  appears  to  have  applied  the  near-miss
    principle  in  his  assessment  of  proportionality.  The  grounds  are
    arguable."

92. In Miah, Burnton LJ stated at �26, "In my judgement, there is no  Near-
    Miss principle applicable in the Immigration Rules.  The  Secretary  of
    State, and on appeal the Tribunal,  must  assess  the  strength  of  an
    article 8 claim, but the requirements of  immigration  control  is  not
    weakened by the degree of non-compliance with the  Immigration  Rules."
    It follows that it is not open to the Tribunal to allow the  appeal  on
    the basis of a near miss, as held in MM and SA (Pankina: near-miss).

93. Further, in Patel [2013] UKSC 72 Lord Carnwath said:

          "55.    Thus the balance drawn by the rules may be relevant to the
         consideration of proportionality......

         56.  Although the context of the  rules  may  be  relevant  to  the
         consideration of proportionality....this cannot be equated  with  a
         formalised "near-miss" or "sliding scale" principle.....Mrs Huang's
         case for favourable treatment outside the rules did not turn on how
         close she had  come  to  compliance  with  rule  317,  but  on  the
         application of the family values which underlie that rule  and  are
         at the heart of article 8. conversely, a near-miss under the  rules
         cannot provide substance to a human rights case which is  otherwise
         lacking in merit.

         57.  It is important to remember that Article 8 is  not  a  general
         dispensing power. It is to be distinguished from the  Secretary  of
         States' discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right...."

94.  The  facts  of  Patel  &  others  are  worth  summarising.  Mr  Alam's
    application for leave to remain as a  Tier  4  student  under  the  PBS
    system  was  refused  as  he  had  failed  to  provide   the   relevant
    documentation with his application.  By  the  time  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal he had produced  qualifying  bank  statements  but  the
    Tribunal held that they were excluded  from  consideration  by  section
    85A, but went on to regard the evidence as relevant to  article  8  and
    found the decision disproportionate on the basis that the appellant now
    met the requirements of the Rules.  The  Upper  Tribunal  reversed  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, finding that the judge  had  erred
    in treating the new evidence as effective compliance with the Rules for
    the purpose of article 8. The Supreme Court  considered  that  the  new
    evidence could be excluded  insofar  as  it  related  to  human  rights
    grounds and article 8  considerations,  and  could  take  the  evidence
    outside the scope of exception 2 in section 85A. However, on the  facts
    of the case, the Supreme Court found no error in the  approach  of  the
    Upper Tribunal, as there was little merit in the article 8 claim,  even
    if some weight was given to the unusual circumstances in which he  lost
    his ability to rely on the new evidence, because of  when  section  85A
    came into force. The evidence did not significantly improve  the  human
    rights case and there is no near miss or sliding scale principle to  be
    applied.


95. For the reasons set out herein, I  find  that  Judge  Duff  made  clear
    errors in respect of his consideration of the appeals in application of
    the Immigration Rules, even though he  ultimately  concluded  that  the
    appeals could not succeed under the Rules, the  degree  to  which  they
    failed to meet the Rules was in fact greater than the judge  concluded,
    which would also have a significant bearing on the  proportionality  of
    the decision under article 8.

96. As far as the near-miss argument is  concerned,  I  am  satisfied  that
    Judge Duff was not consciously seeking to apply a  near-miss  principle
    to the appeal, but the effect of  �19,  referring  to  the  failure  to
    satisfy, "two minor aspects of  the  rules,"  and  �20,  referring  to,
    "trivial  failures  in  respect   of   the   immigration   rules,"   as
    justification for the decision to allow the appeal  was  to  apply  the
    purported near-miss principle to the case either  independently  or  as
    part of the article 8 proportionality  assessment.  That  was  also  an
    error of law.

97. At the conclusion of the hearing before me, I reserved my  decision  on
    error of law. Mr Reynolds submitted that if I found only  an  error  of
    law in relation to Judge Duff going on to consider article  8  when  he
    found the decision was not in accordance with the law, I  could  remake
    the decision without any further hearing. However, if I found errors of
    law as contended for by the Secretary of State, he  submitted  that  it
    should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

98. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. However, the facts of this case are
    clear; it is the conclusions from and the application  of  the  law  to
    those facts which is in issue. In the circumstances, I see  no  purpose
    in remitting the appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  propose  to
    remake it in the Upper Tribunal.

99. Before doing so, given that I adjourned before reaching a  decision  on
    error of law, I consider  it  appropriate  to  allow  the  parties  the
    opportunity to make further representations  in  writing,  should  they
    choose to do so.

Conclusions:

100. For the reasons set out herein I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I reserve the remaking of the decision to the Upper Tribunal.

     I issue directions.

Consequential Directions

101. The representatives of the Secretary of State  and  the  claimants  may
    submit further representations in writing within 14 days of the receipt
    of this error of law decision.

102. The appeal should be relisted before myself at the  earliest  available
    date thereafter convenient to the parties.

103. Failing written  response,  I  will  proceed  to  remake  the  decision
    consistent with the conclusions made herein.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been set aside to be remade.
