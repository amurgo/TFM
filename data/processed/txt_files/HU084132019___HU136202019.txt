Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Muquit, instructed by Deccan Prime Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are husband and wife.  Both are Indian  citizens.   They
    were born on 7 January 1984 and 8 June 1988 respectively.  They appeal,
    with leave granted by the First-tier Tribunal, against a decision which
    was issued by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ian Howard ("the judge")  on  5
    December  2019,  dismissing  their  appeals  against  the  respondent's
    refusal of their human rights claims.

 2. This is an earnings discrepancy case, as such matters have come  to  be
    called following Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673; [2019] 1 WLR 4647.   I
    need not set out a great deal of the background, which was set out with
    clarity and concision in the decision of the judge.   It  suffices  for
    present purposes to state as follows.  The first appellant has been  in
    the UK for a number of years  and  has  made  a  number  of  successful
    applications for leave to remain.  He made one such  application  on  5
    June 2013.  He relied on an assertion that his combined  earnings  from
    employment and self-employment were at a certain level.  He was granted
    leave to remain in response to that application.  When he  subsequently
    applied for  ILR,  the  respondent  made  enquiries  with  HMRC,  which
    confirmed that the combined earnings disclosed for  tax  purposes  were
    significantly lower.

 3. The discrepancy between the two sums caused the respondent to  conclude
    that the first appellant had practised  deception  in  the  past.   She
    considered that he had either deceived the Home  Officer  by  inflating
    his income artificially, so  as  to  ensure  that  he  met  the  income
    requirements under the Points Based System, or that he had reduced  the
    income declared to HMRC, so as to reduce  his  tax  liability.   Either
    way, the respondent concluded that  such  conduct  meant  that  it  was
    undesirable for the first appellant to remain in the UK,  resulting  in
    the  refusal  of  his  application  under  paragraph  322(5)   of   the
    Immigration Rules.

 4. The second appellant has been in the  UK  for  a  considerably  shorter
    period.  She is not eligible for ILR and she made  no  application  for
    it.  Her application was for limited leave to remain as the spouse of a
    settled person.   The  first  appellant's  application  for  settlement
    having been refused for the reasons I have set out  above,  the  second
    appellant's application was also refused.

 5. It is important to  understand  precisely  the  basis  upon  which  the
    respondent concluded that the first appellant had sought to deceive her
    or HMRC in the past.  There were discrepancies between the incomes from
    employment and self-employment which were declared to the  Home  Office
    and HMRC for the tax year in question (2012/2013) but it  was  only  in
    respect of the self-employment that the respondent concluded  that  the
    first appellant had sought to deceive.  It is not clear to me  why  she
    came to that conclusion when there were discrepancies in both  sets  of
    figures.  It might be because the first appellant made  two  amendments
    to his 2012/2013 tax return and the respondent was satisfied  that  the
    amendment concerning his employed earnings was not simply the result of
    a desire to address the difficulty before an application was  made  for
    ILR.  Whilst it is unclear why the respondent expressed no concern over
    the discrepancy in the income from employment, it  is  clear  that  she
    concluded that he had only sought to amend his  self-employment  income
    with HMRC because he was concerned about the effect a discrepancy might
    have on the ILR application which he made shortly thereafter.

 6. As the appeal presented itself  to  the  judge,  therefore,  the  issue
    before him was whether the respondent had established  that  the  first
    appellant had sought to deceive the Home Office or HMRC in  respect  of
    his earnings from self-employment in the 2012/2013 tax year.   That was
    the conduct upon which the respondent relied in the letter  of  refusal
    to justify the ground of refusal under paragraph 322(5).  That was  the
    conduct upon which the first  appellant  had  focused  in  his  witness
    statement for the hearing before the FtT, and upon which Mr Muquit  had
    focused in his skeleton argument for that hearing.

 7. The appellants were represented by Mr Muquit  before  the  judge.   The
    respondent was unrepresented.  Despite what  is  said  at  [6]  of  the
    judge's decision ("He was cross-examined,  there  being  no  presenting
    officer."), it is apparent  from  the  judge's  Record  of  Proceedings
    ("RoP") that Mr Muquit had him adopt his statement and the judge  asked
    a  single  question.   Mr  Muquit  adopted  his  skeleton  argument  in
    submissions.  Nothing more was said, according  to  the  RoP,  and  the
    judge reserved his decision.  In these circumstances, the judge's focus
    should have remained on the self-employed earnings in 2012/2013.

 8. In his decision, the judge reviewed the figures with demonstrable care.
     He noted at [26] that the respondent had focused 'on the self-employed
    income claimed to have been earned by the appellant' and, at [27], that
    'no  complaint   is   made   about   the   employed   income   figure'.
    Notwithstanding the respondent's clear focus, the judge noted  at  [28]
    of his decision that 'both figures provided  to  HMRC  are  lower  than
    those to the respondent' and that the 'employment  figure  provided  to
    HMRC is demonstrably wrong'.  The  judge  then  analysed  the  figures,
    again with care, before noting, at [33], that 'there is �24,434 between
    the two figures', by which he referred to the  difference  between  the
    combined (self-employed and employed) income declared to HMRC  and  the
    Home Office in the 2012/2013 tax year.

 9. At [34], the judge reminded himself of what had been said in R (Khan) v
    SSHD [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC); [2019] Imm AR 384 and Balajigari  (although
    he stated erroneously that the former  decision  endorsed  the  latter)
    before rejecting the first appellant's suggestion that the  discrepancy
    was the result of an error on the part of his accountant.  At [35],  he
    gave the following reasons for that conclusion:

         "I do not accept this explanation.  The figure equates to more than
         �2000 a month.  I cannot conceive that the appellant  believed  his
         income for 2012/2013 was as low as  the  declared  �11,489.   I  am
         satisfied to the requisite standard that the reason for  submitting
         the lower figure in the tax return was to avoid paying the  correct
         amount of income tax at that time.  This is an intentional  act  of
         dishonesty.   I  make  this  finding  notwithstanding  it  was  the
         appellant who approached HMRC to  rectify  the  position  as  I  am
         satisfied  that  this  was  in  anticipation   of   a   forthcoming
         application for leave to the respondent."

10. A number of grounds of appeal  were  advanced  by  Mr  Muquit  but  the
    principal submission, made orally as in writing, may be summarised very
    briefly.  It was said  that  the  judge  had  improperly  brought  into
    consideration the discrepancy between the appellant's employed earnings
    as disclosed to HMRC and the Home Office in 2012/2013.  The sole  focus
    of the refusal letter had  been  the  self-employed  earnings  and  the
    appellant had not had an opportunity, in the circumstances  to  address
    the difficulty with the employed earnings.  He  had  been  entitled  to
    conclude, in light of the way that the refusal letter had been  framed,
    to consider that  this  particular  point  was  not  a  factor  in  the
    assessment under paragraph 322(5).

11. In response to this point, Mr Clarke readily accepted  that  the  judge
    had erred in taking  into  account  the  discrepancy  in  the  employed
    earnings.  The respondent had plainly been aware  of  this  discrepancy
    but it had been  only  on  the  self-employed  earnings  that  she  had
    focused.  Mr Clarke submitted that this error was immaterial,  however,
    because the fact remained that the  total  discrepancy  was  more  than
    �24,434 of which a significant  proportion  was  under-declared  income
    from self-employment.  Even if the judge had only focused on the  self-
    employed income, therefore, he would have reached the same conclusion.

12. I am unable to accept Mr Clarke's submission in this  respect.   It  is
    plain from [35] of  the  judge's  decision  that  he  was  particularly
    concerned by the extent of the discrepancy between the combined  income
    figures.  His reasoning is very clear; because the discrepancy  between
    the combined figures was so substantial, amounting to �2000  per  month
    or thereabouts, no such error could have come  about.   Had  the  judge
    adopted the correct focus, and considered only the discrepancy  between
    the self-employed figures, it is far from  clear  that  he  would  have
    reached the same conclusion.

13. I consider other points made  by  Mr  Muquit  to  be  less  compelling.
    Whilst it is apparent that the judge  gave  himself  no  express  self-
    direction on  the  burden  and  standard  of  proof  in  such  earnings
    discrepancy  cases,  I  accept  Mr  Clarke's  submission  that  he  was
    obviously aware of the correct approach.  So much  is  clear  from  the
    reference to the respondent having established a prima  facie  case  of
    deception and to the judge being satisfied 'to the requisite  standard'
    that the appellant had sought to  avoid  his  tax  liabilities.   These
    findings are clearly expressed in the language of the authorities which
    the judge cited at [34] and there is no indication in the decision that
    he failed to apply the correct approach.

14. Nor was I persuaded by Mr Muquit's submission that the judge had  erred
    in his application of Khan and Balajigari.  The judge certainly slipped
    when he suggested that Martin Spencer  J  had  endorsed  the  Court  of
    Appeal's decision.  Not only would that be impossible as  a  matter  of
    precedent, it would also overlook the fact that  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    decision was issued in 2018 and was considered in the 2019 decision  of
    the Court of Appeal.  Notwithstanding that 'slip', it is quite apparent
    that the judge applied the law correctly;  his  fundamental  error  was
    instead in taking into account a point which had not been raised by the
    respondent in the notice of decision.

15. The consequence of the judge's error is that the decision must  be  set
    aside.  I cannot, as I have stated above, conclude  that  the  decision
    would have been the same were it not for the error.

16. I considered with the advocates at the hearing the relief which  should
    follow in the event that I concluded, as I have, that the decision fell
    to be set aside.  They both submitted that the appeal should  in  those
    circumstances be remitted to the FtT.  Ordinarily, that  would  be  the
    proper course when the error into which the FtT had fallen was of  this
    nature.  It was at this point, however,  that  a  further  complication
    arose.

17. Mr Clarke had very properly brought a matter to  my  attention  at  the
    outset of the hearing.  He noted that  the  appellants'  son  had  been
    registered as a British citizen in November 2019 (and  therefore  after
    the decision of the FtT).  In light of that decision, he indicated that
    the respondent  would  be  unable  to  resist  a  submission  that  the
    appellants' appeals fell to  be  allowed  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds
    because he accepted that they had a  qualifying  child  who  could  not
    reasonably be expected to leave the United  Kingdom  (s117B(6)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 refers).  In light of that
    indication, Mr Muquit had invited Mr Clarke to adopt a position at  the
    outset of the hearing.  Mr Clarke indicated, quite properly in my view,
    that he was unable simply to concede the appeal because the  judge  had
    made a finding which the respondent sought to retain,  which  was  that
    the first appellant had used deception in the past.  For his  part,  Mr
    Muquit considered that it was in the appellants' interests to  seek  to
    expunge that finding, given the potential consequences it might have in
    the future.  It was in those circumstances that I heard argument on the
    appeal despite Mr  Clarke's  acceptance  that  the  s117B(6)  would  be
    determinative of the appeal in the appellant's favour  were  it  to  be
    reconsidered on the merits.

18. Given these events at the start of the hearing, I considered  with  the
    advocates whether it was in the interests  of  the  appellants  or  the
    public purse to remit an appeal for rehearing when it was  accepted  on
    all sides that it  fell  to  be  allowed  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds
    regardless of  the  way  in  which  the  allegation  of  deception  was
    resolved.  (As Mr Muquit correctly  observed,  a  finding  against  the
    first appellant under paragraph 322(5) would be of  no  consequence  in
    relation to s117B(6), since the  latter  is  a  'standalone'  provision
    which compels a positive Article 8 ECHR decision where  its  terms  are
    met.)  On reflection, both advocates  submitted  that  the  appropriate
    course - in the event that I accepted that the decision of the FtT fell
    to be set aside - was simply to allow the  appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds without requiring there to be a further hearing before the  FtT
    or the UT to consider the allegation  of  deception.  On  reserving  my
    decision, that was the way in which I had intended to proceed.

19. On further consideration, I consider that it would be  improper  simply
    to allow the appeal without lawful resolution of the  deception  point.
    It does not suffice, as I had initially suggested to Mr Muquit, for the
    first appellant to leave the  IAC  without  a  finding  on  whether  he
    deceived  the  respondent  or  HMRC  in  the  past.   That  is  because
    resolution of that point is critical to the status that  he  is  to  be
    granted at the end of these proceedings.  In the event that his  appeal
    is merely allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds outwith the  Rules,  as  Mr
    Clarke concedes is inevitable, he will  be  granted  limited  leave  to
    remain.  In the event, however, that his appeal is allowed on Article 8
    ECHR grounds  on  the  basis  explained  by  the  Senior  President  of
    Tribunals in TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 - that he satisfies the
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  for  ILR  -  then   he   can
    legitimately expect the respondent to grant ILR.  I was wrong, frankly,
    when I suggested at the hearing that there would be no prejudice to the
    appellants if the allegation of deception remains  unresolved;  without
    resolution of that issue in their favour, the first appellant will  not
    be entitled to ILR, with all the benefits that brings.

20. In the circumstances, and notwithstanding the  respondent's  acceptance
    that the appeals will ultimately be allowed on Article 8  ECHR  grounds
    as a result of s117B(6), I do order that the appeals be remitted to the
    FtT(IAC) for consideration afresh.  It will be for the  next  judge  to
    decide whether the appeal is to be allowed on Article  8  ECHR  grounds
    'outside the Rules' or, as Mr Muquit will wish to contend, whether they
    fall to be allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds because the respondent has
    failed to establish the sole ground of  refusal  under  the  Rules  and
    paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules is accordingly met.
