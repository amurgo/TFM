                            DECISION AND REASONS
                             EXTEMPORE JUDGMENT

 1. It has previously been found appropriate, given  this  appeal  involves
    asylum issues, that the Appellant be granted anonymity unless and until
    the  Tribunal  directs  otherwise.   As  such,  no  report   of   these
    proceedings shall directly, or indirectly, identify  the  Appellant  or
    any members her family.  Failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    lead to a contempt of court.

 2. The Appellant appeals with permission  a  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, Judge Fowell, promulgated  on  13th  April  2015.  The  judge
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's  refusal  of
    her claim for international protection finding:

      i) not at any risk in her home area from her own family

     ii) she was at risk from the family of her spurned fianc� in  her  home
         area but that the risk from the fianc�'s family did not  extend  to
         the country as a whole so that internal relocation was available to
         the Appellant

    iii) that it was not unduly harsh for her to so relocate  to  where  she
         would  not  be  at  risk  in  the  context  of  her  own   personal
         circumstances including:

          a) her education and work opportunities

          b) the support of  her  family  and  others,  both  here  and  in
             Pakistan.

 3. The Grounds of Appeal before me take issue with  the  decision  on  the
    basis that the judge failed to reason adequately the finding  that  her
    own family would  not  subject  her  to  persecutory  or  ill-treatment
    deserving of protection.  I find no merit in that ground because as the
    judge identifies the Appellant's own  characterisation  of  her  claim,
    right from the start in the screening interview, is that her fear is of
    her fianc�'s family.  In that context I  reject  Mr  Webb's  submission
    that the omission of the fear of her own family in  Pakistan  does  not
    undermine her subsequent claim to her fear of her family.  However  the
    judge did not predicate his conclusion  simply  on  the  basis  of  the
    response in the screening interview.  The judge found very  significant
    that the Appellant's own evidence as to the position of her  family  in
    Pakistan was indicative of an open channel of communication  with  them
    at paragraph 55 of the judge's  decision.   Further  at  58  the  judge
    explains that the Appellant has produced documentation which could only
    have been obtained from her family in Pakistan, namely personal medical
    records in respect of her father. The judge finds the Appellant and  Mr
    C expedient in denying the provenance of the  same.   The  judge  finds
    that as this open channel of  communication  with  her  own  family  in
    Pakistan having provided her with  actual  support  indicates  that  on
    return some level of support would be available for her.   In  addition
    at paragraph 60 the judge notes that the Appellant has  family  members
    in Manchester who have helped her following her  detention,  and  makes
    specific reference to her reliance on her cousin Mr A. In addition Mr C
    who has supported her here is known to her family in Pakistan.  In  the
    context  of  those  interrelations  there  have  been  no  threats   or
    difficulties  occasioned  by  her  family  in  Pakistan   towards   the
    Appellant, Mr A or Mr C, during the  Appellant's  stay  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 4.  The  grounds  additionally  assert  that  even  accepting   that   the
    Appellant's family are providing support to her whilst she  is  in  the
    United Kingdom the fact of her return to Pakistan would give rise to  a
    different  set  of  circumstances  where  that  support  would  not  be
    available because, it is said, it is one thing to support the Appellant
    in the United Kingdom and quite another to support  her  on  return  to
    Pakistan.  That was not an argument which was significantly advanced by
    Mr Webb before me today but in any event it is an argument which I find
    most unattractive, based as it is upon assumption  and  speculation  as
    opposed to the findings of the judge, properly rooted in  the  evidence
    that the family has provided her with support in  the  United  Kingdom.
    That  of  course  takes  into  account  the  provision  of  documentary
    evidence, assistance of the family friend Mr C, as well as the help  of
    the family here with the Appellant's bogus  EEA  application.   I  also
    reiterate that the judge found that the evidence he was provided by the
    Appellant and also Mr C was expediently designed to provide  a  picture
    of difficulty in Pakistan which he found not established, even  to  the
    lower standard of proof.

 5. A further ground  of  challenge  is  to  the  decision  in  respect  of
    relocation in terms of avoiding the risk from the  fianc�'s  family  in
    Pakistan.  The challenge is that it runs counter to the evidence.

 6. The judge found that the Appellant  would  be  safe  elsewhere  because
    there was no evidence that the fianc�'s family would know of her return
    or location. The judge found that  the  Appellant  does  not  have  any
    profile, so  that  there  was  no  risk  her  return  coming  to  their
    knowledge, and even if her parents  felt she would  not  be  safe  with
    them they would help her, and  she had other family  living  elsewhere,
    all of which would help her in her relocation.  There is no evidence of
    the fianc�'s family having the sort of power or reach that  would  lead
    to them being able to find out about her return  or  whereabouts.   The
    practical evidence in additional help in terms  of  relocation  was  of
    availability of assistance by NGOs, in Pakistan and here, both  by  way
    of services  provided  through  financial  packages  and  of  practical
    support in Pakistan. The judge brought forward the findings in  respect
    of the Appellant having friends and relatives in the United Kingdom who
    had supported her, and found that there was  no  basis  upon  which  to
    assume that that support would not  similarly  be  available,  to  some
    extent at  least,  in  Pakistan.  Further  the  judge  found  that  the
    involvement of the family in  Pakistan  in  terms  of  the  Appellant's
    position here was further evidence that they would be unlikely to leave
    her entirely to her own devices.  In that context the  difficulties  of
    the reliability of the Appellant's contrary evidence remained apparent.
     The judge took account of  the  Appellant's  education  and  her  work
    experience in the United Kingdom, and found that this was not a case of
    an Appellant who would not be able to make her way in Pakistan.

 7. Looking at the decision in  the  round  I  find  that  the  judge  made
    sustainable  findings  rooted  in  the  evidence,  and  has  adequately
    reasoned all the issues that had to be determined in the context of the
    framing of the case as it was on the day.  I find that the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal reveals no material error requiring  it  to  be
    set aside, and accordingly the decision dismissing the Appeal stands.
