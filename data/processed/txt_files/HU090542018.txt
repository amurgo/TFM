                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  applicant's  appeal  against   the
    decision of 9 April 2018 refusing him indefinite  leave  to  remain  on
    long residence grounds under para 276B of the Rules on the  basis  that
    he fell within the provisions of para 322(5).  In this decision I  will
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    applicant  as  the  appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as   the
    respondent.

Background

2.    The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 16 June 1968.  He  first
    came to the UK on 7 October 2007 with valid leave to enter as a student
    until 31 January 2009.  On 5 January 2009 he applied for further  leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 General Migrant but his application  was  refused
    on 11 February 2009. His appeal against that decision was dismissed and
    he left the UK on 27 May 2009.  He returned on 3 August 2009 with valid
    entry clearance until 16 June 2011 and was granted  further  extensions
    as a Tier 1 General Migrant following applications made in  April  2011
    and June 2013 until 6 June 2016.  On 3 June 2016 he made another Tier 1
    application but on 8 September 2017 he varied it to apply  for  further
    leave on the basis of 10 years lawful residence.  His  application  was
    refused under the provisions of para 322(5) as it was the  respondent's
    view that it was undesirable to permit him to remain in the UK  in  the
    light of his conduct, character or associations.   In  consequence,  he
    could not meet the requirements of para 276B (ii) and (iii).

3.    In reaching this decision  the  respondent  relied  on  the  following
    facts. In his Tier 1 application in June 2013, the  appellant  declared
    that between 1 May 2012 and 30 April 2013 he had earned  �20,899.13  as
    an employee of ISS Ltd and that he had self-employment with his company
    Kelvino Infotech Consulting Ltd and between 1 May  2012  and  30  April
    2013 he had earned �46,319, verified with invoices, accounts and  other
    documents, giving him total earnings of �67,218.13.

4.    However, when checks were made with HMRC for the tax  year  2012-2013,
    the appellant had declared that he earned �20,405 with ISS and  �15,000
    in  the  form  of  dividends  from  his  self-employment.    This   was
    considerably less than the �46,319 stated to the  respondent.   As  the
    figures provided covered a period over two tax  years,  the  respondent
    also looked at the figures for tax year 2013-2014, where the  appellant
    again had declared �15,000 in the form of dividends.  Even if these two
    figures were taken together at �30,000, they  were  still  considerably
    less than the figure of �46,319.  The appellant's actions in  declaring
    different income figures to HMRC and in his application  in  June  2013
    satisfied the respondent that  the  appellant  had  been  deceitful  or
    dishonest and that because of such conduct it would be  undesirable  to
    allow him to remain in the UK.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.    At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the respondent  was  not
    represented. The appellant and his accountant gave oral  evidence.  The
    appellant also relied on documentary evidence set out in his bundle  of
    documents (A1-152).  The judge summarised the evidence at [11]-[13]  of
    his  decision.   The  appellant  said  that  the  respondent  had  made
    accounting errors as income from his company of �46,319 was  his  share
    of the profit before tax but dividends were paid from profit after tax.
     The amount of the dividends shown in the accounts submitted with  this
    application was �36,500 and the tax return show  dividends  of  �16,666
    for each of the years ending 6 April 2013 and 6 April  2014.   He  said
    that he had not used deception but had followed the respondent's policy
    guidance (see [9] of the appellant's statement at A2).   The  appellant
    then dealt with the subsequent  tax  amendments  which  were  submitted
    after the company had resolved a dispute  with  its  representative  in
    Nigeria who appeared to have claimed excessive expenses.  It  was  only
    after that matter was resolved and his representative issued  a  credit
    note on 31 March 2016 that amended returns were filed and  accepted  by
    HMRC.

6.    The appellant's accountant, Mr Akinjirin, gave evidence  adopting  his
    letter  of  20  August  2018  (A6-7).   He  confirmed  the  appellant's
    explanation of his tax affairs and said that the respondent  had  erred
    in regarding the profit before tax as a dividend.  The dividend  figure
    been payable over two years and there was no discrepancy.

7.    The judge summarised his findings at [18]-[19]:

         "I  have  given  careful  consideration  to  the  evidence  of  the
         appellant and his accountant.  I found them both to be credible and
         I found Mr Akinjirin to be particularly  persuasive.   I  note  his
         qualifications and that he has been the appellant's accountant  for
         a number of years.  I accept their explanation and I  am  satisfied
         that  there  was  no  dishonesty  or  even  carelessness   on   the
         appellant's part.  I note that there was  documentary  evidence  of
         the trade dispute in Nigeria.

         Against that background I find found that the respondent was  wrong
         to refuse the application under the provisions of paragraphs 322(5)
         and 276B(ii)(c).  The appellant therefore met the  requirements  of
         the rules and there is no public interest in the decision."

    The appeal was allowed accordingly.

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

8.    In the grounds of appeal the respondent argued that the  judge  failed
    to give adequate reasons for his findings on a material matter.  It was
    not clear why the Tribunal found that the appellant was  credible  when
    he had claimed an income source of �46,319 as part of his 2012/13  Tier
    1 application whereas for the same period the HMRC  tax  return  showed
    income from this source of �15,000 as a dividend.   It  was  not  clear
    from the decision what this income was: if the �46,319 was not paid  as
    a dividend, it should be clear what  it  was  paid  as  and  why.   The
    Tribunal had said nothing on this and there  was  still  a  failure  to
    explain the discrepancy in the accounts identified by the respondent.

9.     Further,  it  was  not  clear  what  the  �46,319  covered.   In  the
    application for further leave under Tier 1, it was for the period 1 May
    2012 to 30 April 2013 which constituted 11 months in one tax  year  and
    one month in the following tax year but on  that  basis  the  appellant
    appeared to be claiming that nothing  remained  for  the  remaining  11
    months of the second tax year.

10.   Mr Lindsay adopted his grounds.   He  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    failed to give adequate reasons for his findings,  and  this  indicated
    that he had not given anxious scrutiny to the respondent's  claim  that
    the appellant had been guilty of dishonesty.  There were further issues
    which should have been explored.  These related to whether the  sum  of
    �46,319 was a gross or net figure and whether it should all be regarded
    as profit.  The evidence from the accountant failed  to  explain  these
    issues.  There had been no  clear  findings  on  what  the  appellant's
    actual as opposed  his  declared  earnings  were.   There  was,  so  he
    submitted, a clear basis in the evidence for  the  respondent  to  find
    that the appellant had been manipulating his income and  had  not  been
    acted honestly.

11.   Mr Turner submitted that the judge had properly  directed  himself  at
    [17] on the guidance set out in the judgment of Martin Spencer J  in  R
    (o.a.o. Shahbaz Khan) v Secretary of State Upper Tribunal  JR/3097/2017
    and had been entitled  to  find  that  the  respondent  had  failed  to
    discharge the onus of proving dishonesty.  When the explanation set out
    in the appellant's  witness  statement  and  in  the  letter  from  the
    accountant of 20 August 2018 (A6-7) was  taken  into  account,  it  was
    clear, so he submitted, that the judge had reached a decision  properly
    open to him.

Consideration of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

12.   The issue I must consider is whether the judge erred  in  law  in  his
    assessment of this appeal such that the decision should be  set  aside.
    Having considered the guidance given in Shahbaz Khan, the judge rightly
    said at [17] that the respondent was entitled to draw an  inference  of
    dishonesty where there was a  significant  difference  in  figures  for
    annual income put by an appellant to the respondent and to  HMRC.   But
    if the appellant was able to present evidence that he was not dishonest
    but merely careless, there must be a fact-finding exercise to establish
    whether that was sufficient to displace the prima  facie  inference  of
    dishonesty.  In a statutory appeal as  opposed  to  a  judicial  review
    application, it is of course for the judge to carry out that assessment
    and to decide whether  the  evidence  is  sufficient  to  displace  the
    inference of dishonesty.

13.   The  judge  found  that  the  appellant  was  credible  and  that  his
    accountant was both credible and persuasive.   The  respondent  in  the
    grounds argues that the judge failed to give adequate reasons  for  his
    decision as it was not clear what the �46,319 was paid as if it was not
    a dividend.  If it was a dividend, why did it later appear as two  sums
    of �15,000?  The explanation given  by  the  appellant,  summarised  at
    [11], was that the figure of �46,319  was  his  share  of  the  profits
    before tax and that the dividends were paid from profit after tax  (see
    [9] and [11] of his statement at A2).  The total  amount  of  dividends
    declared in his accounts was �36,500 from 4 May 2012 to 26 April  2013.
    The two  tax  returns  referred  to  by  the  respondent  showed  gross
    dividends of �16,666 for tax years ending April 2013  and  April  2014,
    totalling �33,332 (see [12] of his statement also at A2). These returns
    were accepted by HMRC.

14.   The appellant explained that there had been a dispute with  his  agent
    in Nigeria about whether excessive expenses had been claimed  and  that
    it was only when that issue was resolved that his accountant  submitted
    amended accounts for the period 28 February 2011 to 28  February  2015.
    Those amendments were agreed with HMRC.  His accountant confirmed  that
    the respondent was informed about the amended accounts, but no  reasons
    had been given why that explanation was not accepted.

15.   The  appellant's  explanation  for  the  discrepancy  in  the  figures
    submitted is confirmed in the letter dated  20  August  2018  from  his
    accountant, in essence, repeating that dividends were  only  paid  from
    profits after tax,  that  the  amount  of  dividends  declared  in  the
    accounts submitted was �36,500 and  that  the  respondent  had  wrongly
    referred to the appellant's income as derived from self-employment when
    in fact he operated through a  limited  company  and  the  earnings  he
    received were as a director and shareholder.

16.   I am satisfied that  the  explanations  given  by  the  appellant  and
    confirmed by his accountant set out a proper basis on which it was open
    to the judge to find that there was an  explanation  for  the  apparent
    discrepancy  in  the  figures  submitted  in  support  of  his  Tier  1
    application in June 2013 and his tax returns.  It was for the judge  to
    decide on a balance of probabilities whether  the  evidence  given  was
    true and what inferences could properly be drawn  from  it.   He  found
    that the appellant and his accountant were honest and that there was no
    dishonesty or even carelessness on their part.   I  am  satisfied  that
    this finding was properly open to him on the evidence, bearing in  mind
    that he did not have the benefit of hearing the witnesses  being  cross
    examined on their evidence in a case  in  which  dishonesty  was  being
    alleged against the appellant.

17.   In summary, there were grounds on which the respondent could  properly
    infer that the  appellant  had  been  dishonest,  but  he  provided  an
    explanation, supported by his accountant, which the judge was  entitled
    to accept. His findings were properly open to him for  the  reasons  he
    gave. I am not satisfied that the judge erred in law.

Decision

18.   The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law and the decision stands.
