Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr Bajwa counsel instructed by A J Bajwa solicitors
For the Appellant:     Mr Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio  promulgated  on
    the 12th February 2015  whereby  the  judge  allowed  the  Respondent's
    appeal against the decision of the SSHD  to  refuse  the  Respondent  a
    residence card under Regulation  10  of  the  EEA  Regulations.  Having
    considered all the circumstances I do not make an anonymity  direction.



 2. The Respondent applied for a residence card on the  basis  that  he  is
    entitled to a retained right of residence under Regulation  10  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 as amended.  The relevant provisions
    of Regulation 10 provide:-

       Family member who has a retained right of residence

       10 (1) In these regulations, family  member  who  has  retained  the
       right of residence means, subject to paragraph  (8),  a  person  who
       satisfies the conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5)....

       (5) a person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if

       (a) he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person or  of  an
       EEA national with a permanent right of residence on the  termination
       of the marriage or civil partnership of that person;

       (b) he was residing in the United Kingdom in  accordance  with  each
       regulation at the date of termination;

       (c) he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and

       (d) either-

              i)  prior  to  the  initiation  of  the  proceedings  for  the
       termination of the marriage or civil  partnership  the  marriage  or
       civil partnership had lasted  for  at  least  three  years  and  the
       parties to the marriage or civil  partnership  had  resided  in  the
       United Kingdom for at least one year during its duration;....

         (6) The condition in this paragraph is that the person-

         (a) is not an EEA national but would, if he were an  EEA  national,
       be a worker, a self-employed  person  or  a  self-sufficient  person
       under regulation 6; or

         (b) is a family member of a person who falls within paragraph (a).

 3. It was accepted that the only issues related to  Regulation  10(5)  and
    (6) in that it is asserted by the SSHD in the grounds  of  appeal  that
    Judge Adio had failed to make a finding as to  whether  the  Respondent
    was a  worker,  self  employed  person  or  self-sufficient  person  in
    accordance with regulation 6 (a) at the time that  the  Respondent  and
    his EEA spouse divorced.

 4. It was accepted by the Respondent's representative that the  judge  had
    failed to make a finding on the issue raised. It was accepted that  the
    decision would have to be remade.

 5. In remaking the decision  the  Respondent's  representative  sought  to
    submit further documents. The documents had been served  on  the  Upper
    Tribunal and the SSHD on the  27th  May  2015.  Materials  amongst  the
    documents were documents confirming that the appellant was  working  at
    the time that he divorced his wife. There were documents from HMRC  and
    other documents confirming the Respondent's employment at the  time  of
    the divorce. I  gave  leave  for  the  documents  to  be  submitted  in
    evidence.

 6. It was accepted that if the documents were authenticated by  HMRC  that
    the appellant met the  requirements  of  the  Regulations.  The  SSHD's
    representative requested  an  opportunity  to  be  able  to  check  the
    documents with HMRC. I therefore allowed the SSHD 7 days to  check  the
    documents on the understanding that  if  the  documents  proved  to  be
    genuine I would be able to remake the  decision  provided  I  gave  the
    Respondent leave to produce the documents.   I  note  that  the  SSHD's
    representative indicated that, as it was the start of  the  month,  the
    checks should be capable of being done quite quickly.

 7. If the documents proved not to be genuine that the SSHD was to ask  for
    the case to be relisted for evidence to be called. It is now  the  30th
    June and no request has been made for the case to be relisted.

 8. In the bundle of documents are the following:_

         a) A letter from an employer stating that the Respondent  has  been
            in employment since arriving in the UK.

         b) Payslips

         c) P60 for Tax Year to 5th April 2015

         d)  Tax Calculation from HMRC for tax year 2013-2014

         e) Bank Statements

 9. It was accepted that if the documents were genuine and  the  Respondent
    had been working at the relevant  time  then  the  appellant  would  be
    entitled under the Regulations to a residence card on the  basis  of  a
    retained right of residence under Regulation  10.  The  Respondent  had
    divorced his wife on the 6th December 2013. The  Tax  Calculations  for
    2013-2014 show that the Respondent earned ï¿½9550  in  the  year  to  5th
    April 2014. The letter from the employers confirms the  Respondent  was
    working.

10.  There has been no further correspondence from the SSHD. On  the  basis
    of the evidence lodged I find that the Respondent was  working  at  the
    time of his separation from his EEA spouse and that he was  working  at
    the time of the divorce. I therefore find that the Respondent meets the
    requirements of the EEA Regulation, specifically Regulation 10 (5)  and
    (6).

Decision

11. There is an error of law in the original determination and I substitute
    the following decision:- I allow the appeal under the EEA  Regulations.
