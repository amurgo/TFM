For the Appellant:     Mr A Burrett (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Miss A Everett (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Stanford promulgated on 2nd January 2014, following a hearing  at
    Taylor House on 17th December 2013.  In the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Samet Ozata.  The Respondent Secretary  of  State
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Turkey,  who  was  born  on  23rd
    February 1991.  He is the husband of  the  Sponsor,  Summeya  Ozata,  a
    person present and settled in the UK.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he is entitled  to  join  his  sponsoring
    spouse,  Summeya  Ozata,  in  the  UK  because  he  has  satisfied  the
    requirements listed in paragraph E-ECP3.2 and  can  point  to  a  gross
    annual income of at least �18,600 on behalf of his sponsoring  wife  in
    the UK.

 4. The Respondent rejected the application for two  reasons.   First,  the
    Sponsor had been working at the Strood Kebab and Burger House  but  had
    left her employment in August 2012, and this was evidenced by her  P45,
    which  had  been  provided  with  the  Appellant's  application.    The
    Respondent could not take into account the period that the  Appellant's
    husband had not worked at this time.  In any event, she had  been  paid
    cash in hand and the monies that she was allegedly receiving  were  not
    in her bank account.  Second, the sponsoring wife had other employment,
    at Little Stars Day Nursery, and this showed an average income of  �580
    per month, although she was also paid in cash, so that  this  sum  also
    was unreliable as a financial income.

The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge had regard to the fact that the Sponsor, a  British  citizen,
    had met the Appellant in Turkey in 2010.  She  had  regularly  gone  on
    holidays to Turkey.  This was since her arrival in the UK in 2003  with
    her parents.  The Appellant was a neighbour  of  their  family.   After
    they had met in 2010 they remained in contact by  Facebook.   In  2011,
    the Appellant asked the Sponsor to marry him.  They had  an  engagement
    party in September 2011 while her family  was  on  holiday  in  Turkey.
    When in August 2012, the family of the Sponsor went to Turkey again  on
    a holiday, the Appellant and the Sponsor got  married  on  27th  August
    2012 the Sponsor stayed in Turkey.  The Appellant applied for a visa to
    come to the UK.  That application was refused on  27th  November  2012.
    As it turned out,  the  only  reason  for  the  refusal  was  that  the
    Appellant could not satisfy the financial requirements in paragraph  E-
    ECP.3.2 of Appendix FM.

 6. The judge had regard to the fact that the Sponsor produced evidence  to
    show that the P45 was issued in  error.   Letters  from  the  Sponsor's
    employer and from the accountant, who dealt with the  employee's  wages
    explained, that this was an error and that the Sponsor was not  leaving
    employment.  She is merely taken unpaid leave.  Indeed, upon resumption
    of work, the Sponsor continued to be paid  and  wage  slips  issued  on
    resumption of work confirmed the earlier employment (see paragraph 23).

 7. The judge, accordingly, concluded that the Sponsor provided evidence of
    her earnings in the six months before the application  as  required  by
    the Rules.  A P45 had been included, but this was in error,  and  given
    this fact,

         "It is likely that the Respondent would have been  satisfied  about
         the level of her annual income since, for the six months before the
         application, her earnings were evidenced as being �11,010.83.  That
         would suggest an annual income of over �22,000, above  the  minimum
         required by the Rules" (paragraph 25).

    Therefore, at the  time  of  the  application  and  the  decision,  the
    Sponsor's employment was  actually  continuing.   The  Sponsor  had  no
    income during the three months of  September,  October,  and  November,
    because it was during this  time  that  the  Sponsor  had  married  the
    Appellant, and had taken time off in order  to  be  with  him,  and  to
    support his application for leave to come to  the  UK  (paragraph  27).
    The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge erred  in  law  because
    the Rules required that a  person  in  the  Appellant's  position  must
    produce specified documents covering specific periods of time which the
    Appellant had not done.  The Sponsor had taken a three month  leave  of
    absence from her place of work (without  pay)  in  order  to  spend  an
    extended holiday in Turkey with her husband immediately following their
    marriage.  Therefore, the Appellant could not fulfil  the  requirements
    of Appendix FM.  He could not demonstrate that his wife was in  receipt
    of income in excess of �18,600 per annum.  Second, the judge  had  also
    allowed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR grounds and this too was  wrong
    because  the  Appellant  had  been  unable  to  show  that  there  were
    "exceptional" circumstances or that the result of the decision  by  the
    Secretary  of  State  was  such  as  to  impose  "unjustifiably   harsh
    circumstances" on the Appellant.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 6th May 2014, Miss  Everett,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State, submitted that  the  error
    in this case really arose from what was said at paragraphs  25  to  26.
    Here the judge finds that the evidence produced  by  the  Appellant  is
    such  that  there  would  have  been  income  to  satisfy  the  �18,600
    requirement under the Rules.  However, given that the Sponsor had spent
    an extended period of leave in Turkey, it was clear that she was unable
    to do so, and the judge had actually  found  that  if  one  deducted  a
    quarter off the annual income, that the Sponsor had  not  worked,  then
    her income was in the region of �16,500 (paragraph 26).  Therefore, the
    Appellant could not satisfy the financial requirements.

10. For his part, Mr Burrett submitted that there was no error of law  here
    at all.  This is because the judge had proceeded in the way that he had
    done because he had recognised at the outset that the  issuing  of  the
    P45 was done in error (see paragraphs 23 to 24), and that after  return
    back  from  Istanbul  to  the  UK,  the  Sponsor  had  recommenced  her
    employment and her income began to flow as usual on this  basis  again.
    If the Sponsor had not left her employment, then she continued to enjoy
    the earnings that she always had then.  These  earnings  on  an  annual
    basis amount to �22,000, which was above the minimum  required  by  the
    Rules (see paragraph 25).The Sponsor  had  got  married  in  the  three
    months in Turkey and that was the  reason  why  she  had  taken  unpaid
    leave.  This did not mean that she was not working and it did not  mean
    that she was not in receipt of an income.

11. In the alternative, however, the judge also allowed the appeal  on  the
    basis of the High Court judgment in MM [2013] EWHC 1900 (see  paragraph
    39), and the judge held that,

         "The figure would be exceeded  by  the  Sponsor  if  she  were  not
         spending some  unpaid  leave  in  Turkey  with  her  husband.   Her
         employers envisage her returning to work at the end of  periods  of
         unpaid leave when her annual income  would  be  in  the  region  of
         �22,000" (paragraph 40).

12. In reply, Miss Everett submitted that even if the Sponsor had taken off
    three months from work, it did not follow, as the  judge  suggested  at
    paragraph 41, that it would be unjustifiably harsh for her  to  make  a
    fresh application, because that was the inevitable consequence  of  her
    taking time off from work.  It was not unjustifiably harsh because  she
    would succeed next time if her income was in place.

No Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  There are two reasons for this.

14. Firstly, as far as the Rules are concerned, the judge was  entitled  to
    find that, given that the P45 had been issued in error, and given  that
    the Sponsor had not given up her employment, but had only taken  unpaid
    leave to go to Turkey to get married and spend time with  her  husband,
    her usual income of �22,000 per annum was intact.  The judge concluded,
    "It is likely that the Respondent would have been satisfied  about  the
    level of her annual income"  and  this  was  because  the  Sponsor  had
    already earned in the first six months �11,010.83 (paragraph 25).

15. Second, and in any event, even if  there  is  an  error,  there  is  no
    material error, because the judge then allowed the appeal equally  also
    on the basis of Article 8 ECHR grounds.  The judge took  into  account,
    as he was perfectly entitled to do,  the  fact  that  the  Sponsor  had
    "Chosen to take unpaid leave while retaining her employment.   She  has
    done this to nurture her relationship and spend time with her  husband"
    (paragraph 37).  He had regard to the fact that the Sponsor  had  lived
    in the UK for over ten years "and is  a  British  citizen".   He  found
    that, "She wishes to live in  the  United  Kingdom  with  her  husband"
    (paragraph 38).  He also concluded that, "She has established that  she
    has employment from which she could earn a gross income well above  the
    minimum required by the Rules ..." (paragraph 39).  The fact  that  the
    Sponsor could earn an income that was considerably over  that  required
    by the Rules was an important factor to be placed  in  the  balance  of
    considerations.  This the judge did do.

16. The judge had regard to MM [2013] EWHC  1900  where  consideration  had
    been given  to the Respondent Secretary of State's  own  interests  and
    observed that she had set in Rules "A  figure  at  a  level  which  she
    regards as in the public interest to require" but  this  was  a  figure
    which "Would be exceeded by the Sponsor if she were not  spending  some
    unpaid leave in Turkey with her  husband"  (paragraph  40).   In  these
    circumstances the judge was entirely correct to  conclude  in  the  way
    that he did, especially to  find  that  it  would  be  unreasonable  to
    require a fresh application to be made (paragraph  41).   The  test  is
    whether the decision issued by the judge was  irrational  or  perverse.
    It was not.

Decision

17. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

18. No anonymity order is made.
