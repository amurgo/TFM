For the Appellant:     Mr Ahmed, instructed by Visawise Immigration
Services

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the respondent but
    nonetheless I shall refer to the parties as they were described  before
    the First Tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and born on 10th  May  1994  and
    she appealed against a decision dated 14th February 2013 by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse her entry  clearance  to  join  her  spouse
    under Appendix FM.

 3. On 23rd December 2013 First Tier Tribunal Judge Halliwell  allowed  the
    appellant's appeal both under the Immigration Rules and on Human Rights
    grounds.

 4. Nearly six months later the Secretary of State on behalf of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer made an application for permission to appeal, clearly
    marked as dated 4th June 2014, on the grounds that the  judge  had  not
    considered Appendix FM-SE.  The reason given for the application  being
    out of time was 'almost unprecedented staff shortages' and as a  result
    the deadline was missed.

 5. First Tier Tribunal Judge  McDade  granted  permission  to  appeal  but
    failed to address the issue that the application was made out of  time.
    In the meantime the appellant had been granted a visa valid  from  25th
    March 2014 to 25th December 2016.

 6. At the hearing before me Mr Ahmed submitted that the  determination  of
    Judge Halliwell should stand as the decision of Judge McDade dated  2nd
    July 2014 made no reference to the  application  for  an  extension  of
    time.  The time limit was  in  fact  22nd  January  2014.   Mr  Kandola
    conceded that the visa had been granted and applied to withdraw.

 7. The grant of permission to appeal was a conditional grant of permission
    as the issue of the time extension had not been considered, Samir  (FtT
    Permission to appeal: time) [2013] UKUT 00003(IAC) and Boktor and Wanis
    [2011] UKUT 00442 (IAC).

 8. I do not consider time should be extended.  Mr Kandola,  sensibly,  had
    applied to withdraw the application for permission to appeal and I  was
    not persuaded that lack of funds was  an  adequate  explanation  for  a
    delay on behalf of the Secretary of State, of nearly six months  during
    which time the  appellant  had  been  granted  a  visa  BO  and  others
    (extension of time for appealing) Nigeria [2006]  UKIAT  00035.  Indeed
    the appellant presented herself at court.

 9. Application for extension of time for permission to appeal is refused.


Signed                                             Date  27th August 2014

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington
