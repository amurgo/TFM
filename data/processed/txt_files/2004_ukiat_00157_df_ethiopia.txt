Representation

Mr B.T. Davis of Counsel instructed by H.C.L. Hanne  &  Co.  Solicitors  for
the appellant. Mr J. Morris for the respondent.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant, who claimed to  be  a  national  of  Ethiopia,  appeals
      against  a  determination  of  Adjudicator,  Miss  Fiona  E.   Barrie,
      dismissing his appeal against the decision refusing leave to enter  on
      asylum grounds. Removal directions were set for Eritrea.

   2. The Adjudicator did not accept that the appellant or  his  mother  had
      experienced persecution  when in Ethiopia. Nor did he accept that  the
      appellant was an  Ethiopian national as  claimed.   In  light  of  the
      appellant's own evidence that his father was of  Eritrean  origin  and
      (having been deported from Ethiopia) was now a  resident  of  Eritrea,
      the Adjudicator concluded  that  the  appellant   was  a  national  of
      Eritrea.  He then considered the  appellant's  claim  that  he  feared
      persecution if removed to Eritrea but rejected it.


3.    In relation to Article 3 he did  not  consider  the  medical  evidence
      established that the appellant suffered  from  severe  depression.  He
      further found that since in Eritrea there were psychiatric  facilities
      albeit limited, there was no question of the appellant being  able  to
      show return there would violate his Article 3 rights.


4.    In relation to Article 8, the Adjudicator accepted that the  appellant
      had established a private and family  life in  the  UK  and  that  the
      decision requiring him  to  return  to  Eritrea  would  constitute  an
      interference with his right to a private life.  However, he considered
      it was a proportionate interference.

5.     The  grounds  of  appeal  were  twofold.  They  contended  that   the
      Adjudicator has failed to give anxious scrutiny to the asylum  grounds
      of appeal. But principally  they contended that the Adjudicator failed
      to take into account  when  considering  the  proportionality  of  the
      decision to remove him in Article 8 terms that  the  appellant  had  a
      legitimate expectation that he could remain in  the  country  when  he
      entered into a relationship with the woman who is now his wife.

6.    We consider the asylum grounds of appeal extremely weak.  It  is  true
      that the Adjudicator erred in  stating  that  the  appellant  had  not
      produced "any evidence" that  he  was  a  national  of  Ethiopia.  The
      appellant had   produced  documents  showing  he  attended  school  in
      Ethiopia and photographs of himself  in  Ethiopian  national  costume.
      However, given that  the  appellant  had  not  produced  an  Ethiopian
      passport and had failed to give a credible account of his  experiences
      in Ethiopia, we consider it was open to the Adjudicator to  find  that
      the appellant had not discharged the burden of proof on him to show he
      was a national of Ethiopia.

7.    We do not consider that when finding that the appellant had failed  to
      show  he  had  experienced  any  past  persecution  in   Ethiopia  the
      Adjudicator meant to assert a general (erroneous)  principal  that  in
      order to engage the Refugee Convention one always  has  to  show  past
      persecution. He was simply making clear that the claimant  had  failed
      to establish material aspects of his claim. Whatever  the  reason  for
      the appellant's mother not being  deported  (it  may  well  have  been
      because she was a national of Ethiopia),  the  Adjudicator  was  quite
      entitled to conclude that the appellant had failed to give a  credible
      account of his mother being targeted by  the   Ethiopian  authorities.
      The appellant's account in this  respect  was  correctly  assessed  as
      being vague and lacking in detail.

8.    In any event the   removal  directions  set  in  this  case  were  for
      Eritrea and thus the appellant could not succeed in his  appeal  under
      s.69(1) unless  she  could  establish  that  removal  to   Eritrea  in
      consequence of the decision refusing him leave to enter  would  expose
      him to a real risk of serious harm in that country.

9.    The grounds sought to argue that the Adjudicator erred  in  concluding
      that the appellant was a national of Eritrea  for  Refugee  Convention
      purposes. However, Mr Davis rightly acknowledged at the  hearing  that
      this argument lacked  merit.  The  Adjudicator  properly  applied  the
      approach set out by the Tribunal in [2003] UKIAT L  (Ethiopia)  00016.
      Given that the appellant's father  was  of  Eritrean  origin  and  now
      resided  in  Eritrea,  the  appellant  stood   to   acquire   Eritrean
      nationality upon  application  and  there  was  no  valid  reason  for
      considering he could not find three suitable witnesses to support  his
      application.

10.   Mr Davis did not actively seek to pursue any argument  to  the  effect
      that return to Eritrea would expose the appellant to a  real  risk  of
      serious harm. In any event, on the objective evidence available to the
      Adjudicator, we consider he  was  quite  entitled  to  find  that  the
      Eritrean authorities  would have no adverse interest  in  him  and  at
      most might at some stage require him to perform military  service.  By
      reference to the Court of Appeal  judgment  in  Sepet  and  Bulbul  as
      upheld by the House of Lords in their judgment reported  at  [2003]  1
      WLR 856; [2003] ImmAR 428, the Adjudicator  correctly  concluded  that
      the appellant's conscientious objection to having to perform  military
      service (when ordered) could afford no proper basis  for  a  claim  to
      refugee status.

11.   Accordingly  we  consider  the  Adjudicator  gave  valid  reasons  for
      dismissing the appellant's asylum grounds of appeal, as  well  as  the
      Article 3 grounds of appeal.

12.   That leaves the appellant's Article 8 grounds.

13.    The  principal  thrust  of  Mr  Davis's  submissions  was  that   the
      Adjudicator  failed to take into account  that  the  appellant  had  a
      legitimate expectation that he would be granted leave to  enter.  Such
      an expectation arose, he argued, from the sending of a letter  to  the
      appellant on 21 March 2000, informing him that he  had  been   granted
      four years' exceptional leave to remain until 21 March 2004. The  fact
      that on 17 October 2000 the Home Office had written stating  that  the
      letter was not meant for the appellant  but for someone else, did  not
      alter the fact, he argued, that the  original  letter  had  created  a
      legitimate expectation.  Mr Davis relied on the  case of  R (Admin)  v
      SSHD [2003] EWHC 2384 (Admin) in which it was held that  if  the  Home
      Office sent a letter purporting to grant four years leave  to  remain,
      they may be bound by such a decision.
14.   We are unable to agree with Mr Davis that the letter of 21 March  2000
      created a legitimate expectation that the appellant had  been  granted
      ELR.    In  the  first  place,  although  the  letter  did  cite   the
      appellant's Home Office reference number  and  was  addressed  to  the
      appellant's  (then) solicitors, it   bore the subheading:

             "Re: Daniel Fisahaye, Ethiopian, Date of Birth 21/7/85.'

15.   That was a subheading, which did not clearly or properly identify  the
      appellant either in respect  of  the  spelling  of  his  name  (Daniel
      Fessehaye) or in respect of his date of birth (2/6/1974).

16.   Secondly, the appellant  himself clearly did  not  assume  the  letter
      was in fact intended  for  him.  So  much  is  clear  from  the  (new)
      solicitor's letter of 17 August 2003. This referred to  the  appellant
      having "apparently" been granted ELR and states in its relevant parts:

             "Our Client was concerned that the date of birth given on  the
             documents  was  incorrect,  and  there  was  also  a  slightly
             different spelling of his name, but our client is  aware  that
             in the translation of names from Amharic  to   English,  there
             was a variety of spellings ...


             ... he is unable to find out  from  your  telephone  enquiries
             system exactly what is happening.


             Our Client has recently learnt that there  is  another  Daniel
             Fessaheye, an Ethiopian national who has also claimed  asylum,
             whose date of birth is 21 July 1985, apparently  a  minor,  if
             that date of birth is correct.  He is now  even  more  worried
             that he may have received the papers  for  another  applicant.
             (emphasis added)"

17.   This letter makes perfectly plain that as  a  result  of  the  earlier
      letter the appellant had never  formed any clear expectation  that  he
      had been granted  ELR.  At best he harboured hopes and doubts  at  the
      same time.  Furthermore, he had never sought to act upon the letter of
      21 March 2000 in any way so as to suggest he believed he had leave.

18.   Mr Davis also sought to maintain that the appellant's  solicitors  had
      been told by the Immigration Service  at  Heathrow  Terminal  3  on  6
      February 2001 that the appellant had ELR.  However, by this time   the
      appellant had had not one, but  two,  letters  from  the  Home  Office
      confirming that the grant of ELR had been made in respect  of  another
      outstanding: the  second  letter,  dated  9  July  2001,  specifically
      confirmed what was said in the first letter, dated 17 October 2000. In
      such circumstances, even if the Immigration  Service,  several  months
      later had said something to suggest the appellant had been landed with
       ELR, there was no evidence that  this  had  ever  been  confirmed  in
      writing.

19.   In the third place, Mr Davis is quite  wrong  to  represent  that  the
      appellant had a legitimate expectation that he  could  remain  in  the
      country when he entered into his relationship with his  new  wife.  On
      the appellant's own account he only met his  wife  in  December  2001.
      That was over twelve months after he had been told very  plainly  that
      the original letter granting  ELR was in respect of another applicant.

20.   Even if we considered that some weight  in  favour  of  the  appellant
      should be attached to the fact that the  Home  Office  mishandled  the
      appellant's claim during the period from March-October 2000,  we  fail
      to see that this resulted in any  disproportionate  interference  with
      his right to respect for private and family life.  The  appellant  did
      not maintain that during this period he had a close  private  life  or
      family life relationship which could have been pursued differently had
      he possessed limited leave at the time (e.g. by making  an  in-country
      application as a fianc� or spouse).  In  short,  he  did  not  produce
      evidence of suffering any detriment to any protected Article  8  right
      during the relevant period.

21.   Accordingly, we see no relevance to this  case  of the principles  set
      out in Shala [2003] EWCA, Civ 2333;  [2003] All ER 407.

22.   As regards the Adjudicator's treatment of the  Article  8  grounds  of
      appeal otherwise, we consider he was quite entitled to  conclude  that
      the appellant had failed to demonstrate that the  decision  to  remove
      him was unlawful or disproportionate. The appellant's  wife  had  been
      granted refugee status in relation to Ethiopia,  not  Eritrea,  so  it
      cannot be said that the grant of refugee  status  to  her  ipso  facto
      precluded return to Eritrea.  The fact that she  herself  may  not  be
      able to obtain Eritrean  nationality  was  not  determinative  of  her
      ability to accompany her husband to Eritrea in  her  capacity  as  his
      wife.  However, even if it were  accepted  that  the  Adjudicator  was
      wrong to find that the appellant's wife and children  could  accompany
      him to Eritrea, it is clear from Mahmood [2001] INLR and Ekinci [2003]
      EWCA Civ 765 that an appellant can be expected to pursue the option of
      applying from abroad  for entry  clearance  unless  he  can  show  the
      existence of exceptional circumstances.  In  our  view,  none  of  the
      points raise in the written  grounds  or  in  Mr  Davis's  submissions
      identified any exceptional circumstances in this case.


23.   For the above reasons this appeal is dismissed.
