For the Appellant:     Mr Maddah, Representative, YICS
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Row dated 28 May 2019  dismissing  the  Appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Respondent dated  28  November  2018
    refusing his human rights claim.

2.   The Appellant is a national of Iran and first  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom in July 2008 and claimed  asylum.   That  application  was  not
    successful, either on initial application or on appeal.   However,  the
    Appellant later formed a relationship with a British national  and  the
    Appellant was granted leave to remain in November 2015 in  relation  to
    this relationship.  Unfortunately, the Appellant's relationship came to
    an end and he made an application on 30 April 2018 for further leave to
    remain on the basis of his private life in the  United  Kingdom.   What
    that private life consisted of was, in addition to having some  friends
    in the United  Kingdom,  that  the  Appellant  had  opened  a  takeaway
    business and ran it as a self-employed concern.  He had  one  full-time
    employee and two part-time employees.

3.   The Respondent refused the application on grounds  that  the  Appellant
    did not meet the criteria set out for leave to remain on  private  life
    grounds under paragraph 276ADE(1)  and  that  the  decision  would  not
    involve a disproportionate interference with  his  private  life.   The
    Appellant appealed and the matter came before the judge on 23 May 2019.



4.   The Appellant gave evidence and the judge made findings which  included
    the following.  The Appellant's takeaway food business showed a  profit
    of �9,012 for the tax year ending 5 April 2019 and the  Appellant  also
    received  an  additional  income  from  renting  out  certain  property
    associated with the takeaway business, producing an  income  of  �2,500
    per year. The suggestion by the Appellant that he could not immediately
    be removed from the United Kingdom to Iran because the  Respondent  did
    not possess any travel document for him was not relevant to the outcome
    of the appeal and would not represent a  significant  obstacle  to  his
    integration into Iran.  The Appellant's associated argument that if  he
    were unsuccessful in this appeal  he  would  remain  in  the  UK  as  a
    destitute asylum seeker was also  found  not  to  be  relevant  to  his
    integration into Iran.  The suggested claim that  the  Appellant  would
    fear harm in Iran because of being a failed asylum seeker was not  made
    out.

5.   The judge also found as follows:

         "17. The Appellant further argues that the  economic  situation  in
             Iran is such that he would not be able to  obtain  employment.
             He has provided background evidence that sanctions imposed  by
             the  United   States   of   America   have   caused   economic
             difficulties.  I accept that this is the case.   However,  the
             Appellant would be in the same position as most  Iranians.  He
             would be in a better position than many.  He is 29 years  old,
             he is in good health.  He has had the experience of living  in
             a foreign country.  It is said that he speaks English.  He has
             run his own business in the United Kingdom.   He  argues  that
             such skills are not transferable. I do not accept that.  There
             must be many places in Iran selling food. The skills of  which
             the Appellant will have developed in business  in  the  United
             Kingdom are the sort of skills that he would need to pursue  a
             similar business in Iran."

6.   At paragraph  18  the  judge  found  that  there  were  no  significant
    obstacles to the Appellant's return.  Under the title 'Article 8  ECHR'
    the judge considered the following:

         "20. I take into account that the Appellant has been in the country
             since 2008.  He has developed relationship. He has  started  a
             business.  I take into account that if he  was  to  leave  the
             country he would not be able to continue to run that  business
             himself.  He could however sell it  and  use  the  capital  to
             start again in Iran.  He could ask someone else to run it  for
             him.  It is a business on a relatively small scale which  made
             a profit of just over �11,000 in the  most  recent  accounting
             year.  It is however something which weighs in the Appellant's
             favour."


7.   However, the judge took into  account  the  importance  of  maintaining
    immigration control and the positive satisfaction of Immigration Rules;
    the fact that the Appellant could continue a private life in Iran;  the
    judge  directed  himself  that  the  Appellant  is  capable  of   being
    financially independent in the United Kingdom, but this had  a  neutral
    effect; his private life was developed at a time when  his  immigration
    status was precarious.  Ultimately the judge found at paragraph 27 that
    the public interest in  the  removal  of  the  Appellant  exceeded  the
    interference with his private life and that the  Respondent's  decision
    was lawful.

8.   The Appellant appealed against  that  decision  in  grounds  of  appeal
    dated 26 August 2019 which are with respect loosely drafted but  appear
    to argue, in summary, that the judge erred in law in:

    (1)  failing to consider the impact of the current financial  sanctions
         that has made it impossible to transfer  funds  from  any  proposed
         sale of his business as the judge suggested, and  this  represented
         an insurmountable obstacle to the continuation of  the  Appellant's
         private life in Iran;


    (2)  failing to have sufficient regard to the asserted  fact  that  the
         removal of the Appellant would result in the loss of one  full-time
         and two part-jobs in the United Kingdom  and  the  removal  of  the
         Appellant would not be in the interests of the British economy.

9.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper  Tribunal  Judge  O'Callaghan
    on 3 September 2019 finding that it was arguable  that  the  judge  had
    failed to determine whether the Appellant would be unable  to  run  his
    business from Iran and whether the Appellant would be able to  transfer
    the proceeds of any sale of his business to  Iran,  arguably  impacting
    upon the assessment as to proportionality.  Permission was also granted
    on ground 2 although it was described as being significantly weaker.

10.  I have heard submissions from the parties  today.   On  behalf  of  the
    Appellant Mr Maddah relies on the grounds of appeal and  the  terms  in
    which permission was granted.  At the outset of the hearing  I  ensured
    that I had a copy of the Appellant's bundle which was before the judge.
     It appeared to me that part of the original  bundle  may  have  become
    detached.  Mr Maddah provided me with a spare copy  of  the  bundle  so
    that I had all of the material which the Appellant had put  before  the
    judge relating to the economic sanctions imposed on Iran.   However,  I
    specifically asked Mr Maddah if there was  any  material  within  those
    documents which specifically supported the Appellant's proposition that
    he would be unable to transfer money to Iran.  Mr Maddah confirmed that
    although the documents spoke of the hardship  caused  in  Iran  by  the
    sanctions in a general sense, there was in fact nothing specific within
    the bundle which confirmed anything about the ability to transfer money
    to a bank in Iran.

11.  However, Mr Mills submitted that it  was  accepted  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent that banks in  the  United  Kingdom,  although  not  legally
    obliged to suspend banking transactions to Iran, have done so,  because
    they are international organisations and the banking laws in the United
    States of America currently prohibit banking transactions with  persons
    in Iran.

12.  Mr Maddah continued to argue that it would not be possible to  transfer
    any money  to  Iran.   He  also  relied  upon  the  argument  that  the
    Appellant's departure would result in the closure  of  a  business  who
    employed three persons in the United Kingdom.

13.  For his part Mr Mills resisted the appeal.

    Discussion

14.  I do not find that there is any material error of law  in  the  judge's
    decision.  There is no evidence within the  Appellant's  bundle  as  to
    whether or not it is currently possible to transfer money from  a  bank
    in the United Kingdom to a bank in Iran. Mr Mills' concession that this
    may not be possible is a generous one.  However, as Mr  Mills  put  it,
    and I find, there was no evidence that it  is  actually  impossible  to
    transfer money to Iran by some other means.   Money  transfers  can  of
    course be made other than through a bank, and the variety of methods of
    doing so has increased in recent years with electronic applications.  I
    find that the Appellant has not made out his case.  The  Appellant  has
    not  established  that  there  was  evidence  before  the  judge  which
    supported the Appellant's proposition that it was impossible for  money
    to be transferred from the United Kingdom  to  Iran.   The  Appellant's
    first point therefore falls.

15.  Judge O'Callaghan seems to have suggested that  it  was  arguable  that
    the judge failed to consider the point that the Appellant would not  be
    able to run his business from Iran.  For my  part,  this  is  a  matter
    which does not even require  consideration  by  the  judge.   It  would
    naturally be the case that a person being required to leave the  United
    Kingdom would not be able to continue to  run  a  business  within  the
    United Kingdom, particularly one such  as  a  takeaway  which  involves
    physical presence and activity in the United Kingdom.   This  would  be
    the natural consequence of any person being  removed  from  the  United
    Kingdom and is implicit within the judge's decision.   I  do  not  find
    that it required any further consideration on the part of the judge.

16.  Further, insofar as the Appellant argues that it is not in  the  public
    interest to remove him from the United Kingdom because the  closure  of
    his business would result in the loss of three jobs, I am  referred  by
    Mr Mills to the  authority  of  Thakrar  (cart  JR;  Art  8:  value  to
    community) [2018] UKUT 336 IAC in which the  second  paragraph  of  the
    head note provides as follows:

         "2.  Before concluding  that  submissions  regarding  the  positive
             contribution made by an  individual  fall  to  be  taken  into
             account for the purposes  of  Article  8(2)  of  the  ECHR  as
             diminishing the importance to be given to immigration controls
             a judge must  be  satisfied  that  the  contribution  is  very
             significant.  In practice this is likely to arise  only  where
             the  matter  is  one  over  which  there  can   be   no   real
             disagreement.  One touchstone for determining this is  to  ask
             whether the removal of the person concerned would lead  to  an
             irreplaceable loss to the community of the United  Kingdom  or
             to a significant element of it."

17.  I find, with respect to the Appellant, who must be  commended  for  his
    determination in opening a business in the  United  Kingdom,  that  the
    extent of the Appellant's business  activity  does  not  even  arguably
    reach the level described in  Thakrar,  i.e.,  that  of  being  a  very
    significant benefit to the community. Again  with  respect,  it  cannot
    properly be said that closing a takeaway business  would  represent  an
    irreplaceable loss to the community of  the  United  Kingdom  or  to  a
    significant element of it.  I am therefore bound to find that there  is
    no material error in the judge's decision.
