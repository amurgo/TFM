Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Wazed-Ali, of E1 Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Drabu  CBE)  who,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 18th  February  2014  allowed  the  Respondent's  appeal
    against the decision of the Respondent made on 3rd May 2013.

 2. For the sake of convenience I shall refer to the parties as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The Appellant, Mr Rahman, was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant  under  the  points-based  system
    until 13th December 2012.  On 13th December 2012  he  submitted  an  in
    country application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General)  Student.
    In a letter dated 17th December 2012 a letter  was  received  from  the
    Respondent acknowledging the application  that  was  made  and  further
    informing the Appellant that if there was to be any  problem  with  the
    validity the caseworker would write to him.  Further letters were  sent
    to  the  Appellant  on  14th  January  2013  again  acknowledging   the
    application made by him in December and informing  him  that  if  there
    were to be any problem with the validity of the application,  then  the
    Respondent would inform him.  The letter goes on to say

         "if there is any problem with the validity of the application, such
         as missing documentation or omissions on  the  form,  a  caseworker
         will write to you as soon as possible to  advise  what  action  you
         need to take to rectify the problem.  If there is an issue with the
         fee you have paid, your application will be  rejected  and  details
         sent to you on how to make another application."

 4. A further letter containing the same information was also sent  on  6th
    February 2013.  However on 18th January 2013 the Appellant  received  a
    letter referring to the application made  for  leave  to  remain.   The
    letter stated that the application was not valid as the  specified  fee
    had not been paid.  The letter referred to "the passage next to the box
    ticked below provides more detail about the failure to  pay  the  fee."
    The box ticked referred to credit card details being provided  but  the
    issuing bank rejected payment.

 5. In the light of that letter, a further application  was  made  on  10th
    January 2013 which resulted in a  refusal  dated  3rd  May  2013.   The
    decision on 3rd May 2013 made it plain that he did not have a right  of
    appeal against the decision stating that the application  was  made  on
    28th January 2013 but that his leave  to  enter  had  expired  on  13th
    December 2012 and therefore as he did not have leave to  enter  at  the
    time of the application there was  no  right  of  appeal  against  that
    decision.

 6. The reasons for refusing the second application were  premised  on  the
    basis that the Appellant could not qualify as  having  an  "established
    presence studying in the United Kingdom" because the last time  he  was
    given permission to stay as a student was until 13th December 2012  and
    therefore at the time of the application it was stated that because  he
    had no valid leave he had not got an established presence  studying  in
    the United Kingdom.  As a result of that, it meant that the  amount  of
    money that he  was  required  to  demonstrate  was  in  excess  of  the
    maintenance funds that he would have had to  have  had,  if  his  first
    application had been valid.  Thus in essence, it  was  refused  on  the
    basis that the first application was refused because it was an  invalid
    application  and  the  decision  therefore  rested  upon   that   first
    application being an invalid application.

 7. The appellant appealed that decision with written grounds of appeal.  A
    direction was issued pursuant to that appeal on 13th June  2013.   That
    decision made it plain that the Appellant had seven working  days  from
    the date of the notice to file documentary evidence showing that he had
    made an application for further leave to remain before his  last  leave
    expired and the outcome of that application and if it was rejected, why
    it was rejected or why it was contended that it  was  wrongly  rejected
    and why the Appellant had a right of appeal.   It  is  clear  from  the
    Tribunal file that information had been received  by  the  Tribunal  in
    accordance with that direction because a further direction  was  issued
    by the Tribunal on 22nd July 2013.  The direction that was given is  as
    follows:-

         "It is argued by the Respondent that the Appellant does not have  a
         right of appeal  under  Section  82  Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002 because he/she did not apply for  leave  to  remain
         until after the expiry of his/her existing leave.  This is  because
         a prior application made during the currency of that leave was  not
         accompanied by the correct fee.  Following the decision  in  Basnet
         (Validity of an application - respondent) [2012] UKUT  00113  (IAC)
         the onus of proof is on the Respondent to show that the correct fee
         was not paid.  It is therefore directed that the appeal  be  listed
         for substantive hearing; that at that substantive hearing the issue
         of validity to be decided and that at least fourteen days prior  to
         the substantive hearing the Respondent lodge with the Tribunal  and
         serve upon the Appellant any information showing that  the  correct
         fee was not paid."

 8. Thus the application was listed before the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Drabu CBE) on 24th January 2014.  It is clear  from  the  determination
    that the  Appellant  was  represented  by  Counsel,  instructed  by  E1
    Solicitors but there was no representation on behalf of  the  Secretary
    of State.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Drabu CBE set out the  history  at
    paragraphs [1]-[2] of the determination including the direction to  the
    Secretary of  State  to  provide  the  documentary  evidence  that  was
    specified in the  direction.   The  judge  recorded  at  [3]  that  the
    Respondent had been "totally non-compliant with the directions made  by
    the Tribunal on 22nd July 2013."  He went on to consider the  right  of
    appeal at paragraph [3] onwards.  He concluded from the  evidence  that
    the Respondent had failed to produce any evidence to  the  contrary  of
    that provided by the Appellant and heard argument from Counsel  at  [4]
    in which Counsel drew his attention to the statement of  the  Appellant
    dated 15th January 2014 which gave explanations that  the  Respondent's
    assertion that the bank may have refused payment  in  response  to  his
    request for payment of fees in respect of  his  first  application  was
    plainly wrong.  He referred to the bundle of documents filed in support
    of the appeal and found that the relevant period  showed  that  he  had
    sufficient funds in his account at the time and that therefore the bank
    would have had no reason to refuse a request of  a  payment.   He  made
    reference to the Appellant's evidence in his witness statement that  he
    had been "extremely surprised" to be informed by  the  Respondent  that
    the bank had refused his request for payment and that the Appellant had
    also stated "there was no fault on my part and I should not be punished
    as I am innocent.  It is the Respondent's fault or  that  of  the  bank
    staff assigned to process the payment."  The judge  found  that  having
    examined the relevant documents he accepted  that  explanation  by  the
    Appellant.

 9. At  [5]  the  judge  had  reserved  his  decision  and  had  asked  the
    Appellant's representative to confirm by way of a letter from the  bank
    that it had not refused any request for  payment.   However  the  judge
    went on to state that he decided not to wait for such a letter and that
    in the light of all the circumstances he had decided that  it  was  not
    necessary  to  do  so.   Thus  he  reached  the  conclusion  that   the
    application was validly made in time and therefore was refused  without
    good reason.  At [6] the judge went on to state that "the  only  ground
    upon which it was refused was non-payment of fees.  There was no  other
    reason given for refusal.  The Appellant met  the  requirement  of  the
    Rules."  He went on to state at  [7]  that  in  the  circumstances  the
    reason for refusal of the second application was not in accordance with
    the law and the Rules and that he accepted the argument advanced by the
    Appellant in his  witness  statement  at  paragraphs  13-15.   Thus  he
    allowed the appeal.

10. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal  that  decision  and
    permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Deans on 10th March 2014
    stating  "the  Respondent  is  arguing  essentially  that   the   judge
    misdirected himself as to a material fact.  In pursuing  this  argument
    however the Respondent will have to address her apparent breach of  the
    Tribunal's direction.  The grounds are nevertheless arguable."

11. The appeal came before the Upper Tribunal for hearing on 8th  May  2014
    when it was adjourned as a result of missing documentation.  The appeal
    then came before the Upper Tribunal on 7th January 2015.  The Secretary
    of State was represented by Mr Kandola, Senior Presenting  Officer  and
    the Appellant by Mr Wazed-Ali, of E1  Solicitors.   Mr  Kandola  relied
    upon the grounds that were drafted for the appeal.  He  submitted  that
    the Appellant had been granted leave to enter as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student until 13th December 2012 and on the day he had submitted an  in
    country application  for  further  leave  to  remain.   This  had  been
    rejected for non-payment of fees and the relevant fee was  the  sum  of
    �394.  He submitted that the judge had allowed the appeal on the  basis
    that the first application was refused without good reason at paragraph
    6 and that the judge had  come  to  the  conclusion  on  the  basis  of
    evidence provided at the hearing that he had sufficient  funds  in  his
    bank account at the relevant time, therefore there was  no  reason  for
    payment to have been refused.  He submitted that it has not been  clear
    which bank statements the judge was referring to and there was a direct
    conflict of evidence between the documents the judge was shown and  the
    bank statements submitted by the Appellant.  He directed  the  Tribunal
    to the Lloyds Bank account statements to show that he had only  �232.04
    and not the �394 that he was required to have as he claimed and as  the
    judge had found in his determination.  As the grounds had  set  out  on
    13th December 2012 the Appellant had just �232.04 in  his  account  and
    that remained until 18th December 2012 where �140 was paid in, bringing
    the balance to �372 and it was not until 20th December  2012  that  the
    Appellant had sufficient money in his account.

12. Mr Kandola submitted that this was further supported by fresh  evidence
    that had been annexed to the Secretary of State's  Grounds  of  Appeal.
    Those documents had not been annexed to the  grounds  in  the  Tribunal
    file therefore Mr Kandola provided further copies.  It consisted of  an
    e-mail dated 17th January 2014 to the Presenting Officer  and  annexing
    to it a screenshot showing that the authorisation had been declined  on
    17th December.  Mr Kandola conceded that this had not been  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  He submitted that the error of law was  based  on
    inadequate reasoning and the bank statements that had been referred  to
    in the grounds.

13. Mr Wazed-Ali on behalf of the Appellant submitted  that  there  was  no
    error of law in the decision of the judge and that although the grounds
    referred to payment on 13th December 2012, that was  the  date  of  the
    application and not necessarily the date of payment.  He  directed  the
    Tribunal to the letters in the Appellant's bundle and in particular the
    letter of 17th December  2012  addressed  to  the  Appellant  from  the
    Respondent acknowledging the application that had  been  made  on  13th
    December and stating that if there were to  be  any  problem  with  the
    validity of the application then details would be sent to him.  At page
    8 of the bundle there was a further letter in exactly  the  same  terms
    but on 14th January 2013.  Thus he submitted that  there  had  been  no
    information provided to the Appellant that his application was  invalid
    by reason of those two letters and therefore by 14th January  2013  the
    Secretary of State was still referring to the application being a  live
    one and there being no problems with payment of  the  money.   Thus  he
    submitted that the bank statements demonstrated that from 20th December
    the Appellant had sufficient money in his account to pay  the  fee  sum
    required of �394.  It was not known by  the  Appellant  what  date  the
    Secretary of State had attempted to make payment.  This information had
    not been before the Tribunal despite the direction  that  was  made  on
    22nd July 2013 and thus it was open to the judge to find that by reason
    of the letter of 17th December and taken in conjunction with the letter
    of 14th January 2013 that the Secretary of State had  not  demonstrated
    when payment had been taken and on the bank statements before the judge
    he was entitled to find that there was sufficient money in the  account
    up until the dates of those letters.  Thus he submitted there had  been
    no clear evidence before the judge on which date payment of the fee had
    been taken and thus the judge was right to find that the Appellant  had
    made a valid appeal on the evidence that was available before him.

14. Mr Kandola by way of reply stated that he would rely upon a mistake  of
    fact and that it was by reason of the evidence annexed to  the  grounds
    which demonstrated the date upon which the fee had been taken  and  the
    reason for the specified fee having been refused.  When  asked  if  the
    grounds as drafted had made that submission, he stated that the grounds
    did not expressly state that submission but that at paragraph 3 of  the
    grant of permission by Judge Deans, it was stated that  the  Respondent
    would have to address a breach of  the  Tribunal's  directions  and  he
    stated he could offer no explanation why that information had not  been
    provided before the judge as the e-mail had been sent on 17th  January.
    Mr Wazed-Ali further submitted that he had not  seen  the  Respondent's
    documents nor had he received the e-mail attached to the  grounds.   He
    further submitted that the grounds as drafted did not properly make any
    submission as now contended on behalf of the Secretary of State.

15. I reserved my decision.

16. It is plain from reading the grounds of permission drafted on behalf of
    the Secretary of State that it was asserted that the judge had  allowed
    the appeal on the basis that the application was made in  time  and  it
    was a valid appeal.  At [3-5] of the  grounds  of  permission,  it  was
    asserted that the judge  had  come  to  the  conclusion  based  on  the
    evidence provided at the hearing  that  the  appellant  had  sufficient
    funds in his bank account at the relevant time and therefore there  was
    no reason for such payment to have been refused.  The grounds at [4] go
    on to state, whilst it was not clear which bank  statements  the  judge
    was referring to there was a conflict  of  evidence  between  the  bank
    statements submitted for the purposes of the judicial review statements
    and those in the Appellant's bundle.  It was further  asserted  at  [5]
    the TSB Bank account statements showed that on 13th December, the  date
    of the application, he had �232 in his account and the account remained
    the same until 18th December 2012 bringing the balance to  �372.04  and
    it was not until 20th December 2012 that he had sufficient money in his
    account to meet the fee  requirements.   The  grounds  then  go  on  at
    paragraph [6] to refer to the fresh evidence which is attached  to  the
    grounds.  There is no reference in the grounds for any  permission  for
    such documentation to be admitted or importantly, any reference to  why
    this information should give rise to an error of law.

17. I have considered the submissions of the parties and have  done  so  in
    the light of  the  evidence  that  was  placed  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Whilst the grounds at [4] appear to state that  it  was  not
    clear which bank statements the  judge  was  referring  to,  I  see  no
    difficulty in finding which statements were relevant.   They  were  set
    out in the bundle of documents that had been sent to the  Tribunal  for
    the purposes of the hearing.  The bank  statements  for  the  requisite
    period are set out at pages 20 to 23 of the bundle and  refer  to  bank
    statements held at Lloyds Bank.  The judge made reference to  the  bank
    statements that were set out in the bundle at [21] which showed that on
    13th December he had a balance of �232.04 and  that  by  20th  December
    there was �402 in the account and thereafter the money increased in the
    account so that there was always in excess of  that  amount  throughout
    December and into January until the end date of the statement.

18. What the grounds fail to take into account is the other  evidence  that
    the judge relied upon and the basis upon which the case was advanced on
    the Appellant's behalf.  The Appellant had produced a witness statement
    at pages 10 to 12 of the bundle  dated  15th  January  2014.   In  that
    document he had made reference to the letters that had been sent by the
    Secretary  of  State  after  13th  December  2012  in  respect  of  his
    application.  Those are the letters that Mr Wazed-Ali had  referred  to
    in his submissions.  They comprised of the letter of 17th December 2012
    and the letter of 14th January 2013, both letters  being  in  the  same
    terms which acknowledged the applications made  by  the  Appellant  and
    informing him that if there were any problems with the validity of  the
    application he would be told.  Therefore the evidence before the  judge
    was that by 14th January 2013 it was not being asserted that there were
    any problems with the fee having been paid and that the bank statements
    showed that from 20th December onwards there was  sufficient  money  in
    the account.  Whilst the grounds refer to 13th December date as showing
    an amount of �232, there was no evidence before the judge on behalf  of
    the Secretary of State as to the date at which payment was taken.   The
    fact  that  the  application  was  made  on  13th  December  does   not
    necessarily mean that payment was taken on that date.  Therefore  there
    was no evidence before the judge as to when payment was  taken  and  in
    the light of those letters of 17th  December  and  14th  January  2013,
    taken in conjunction with the Appellant's bank  statements,  the  judge
    found that the Respondent had not discharged  the  onus  of  proof  and
    therefore he accepted the evidence of the Appellant.

19. As the decision in Basnet (Validity of  an  application  -  Respondent)
    [2012] UKUT 00113 (IAC) makes it clear the burden is on the  Respondent
    who has the evidential burden of demonstrating that the application was
    not accompanied by such  authorisation  to  enable  the  Respondent  to
    receive the fee in question.  It was wholly open to the judge  to  find
    that contrary to the case of Basnet and in particular paragraph [32] of
    that decision that the Respondent had been totally  non-compliant  with
    the directions that had been made by the Tribunal on  22nd  July  2013.
    By the time of the appeal in January 2014 the Secretary  of  State  had
    six months to provide the evidence that had  been  directed,  including
    the date of when payment was taken and the reasons why, if payment  had
    not been  taken,  why  it  had  occurred.   Furthermore  there  was  no
    representation on behalf of the  Respondent  before  the  Secretary  of
    State, therefore it was wholly open to the judge on the  evidence  that
    was before him to reach the conclusions that he did.  He  was  entitled
    on the evidence that was before him to find that the Secretary of State
    had not discharged the burden upon her that  the  application  was  not
    accompanied by the specified fee.  Indeed the Respondent had offered no
    evidence to that effect. There was no evidence before the judge  as  to
    even what date payment had been taken and therefore  on  the  available
    evidence it was open to the judge to find that the application had been
    accompanied by the specified fee and therefore was validly made.

20. Whilst the Secretary of State  now  provides  evidence  concerning  the
    reasons as to why payment was declined, that evidence  was  not  placed
    before the First-tier  Tribunal.   Whilst  the  e-mail  is  dated  17th
    January 2014, which is before the hearing on 24th  January  2014,  that
    evidence was not placed before the First-tier Tribunal and indeed there
    was no representation before the Secretary  of  State  at  the  hearing
    itself.  The direction that had been made by the Tribunal on 22nd  July
    2013 made it  plain  what  evidence  should  have  been  filed  by  the
    Respondent and therefore by the date of that e-mail they had six months
    in which to provide that information but had  failed  to  do  so.   The
    evidence was then filed after the appeal  had  been  heard  and  in  an
    attempt to demonstrate that the judge had made an  error  of  law.   It
    cannot be an error of law for a judge not to take into account material
    that had not been placed before him.  Nor do I find  that  the  grounds
    that were drafted on behalf of the Secretary of State set out with  any
    particularity a Ground of Appeal based on the  submission  made  by  Mr
    Kandola that the fresh evidence should be admitted to show a mistake of
    fact relying upon the principles laid down in E and R v  The  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2004] - EWCA  Civ  49.   The  grounds
    make no such submission and the grounds as drafted  clearly  relate  to
    the information that had been before the judge and the challenge was in
    respect of that.  The Secretary of State was directed to  provide  that
    evidence on 22nd July 2013.  That direction was not complied with until
    six months later and even then the  information  had  not  been  placed
    before the First-tier  Tribunal  when  it  made  a  decision.   It  was
    therefore open to the judge to reach a decision on  the  material  that
    had been placed before him which is what the judge had done but it  has
    not been demonstrated that the judge made an error of law in doing  so.
    In any event, it is too late for the Secretary of  State  now  to  rely
    upon evidence that was known at the  hearing  but  the  Respondent  had
    failed to place before the judge; that such evidence  does  not  comply
    with the principles set out in Ladd v Marshall where it  is  said  that
    the Appellant must not have been  responsible  for  the  mistake.   The
    evidence was available but the Secretary of State had just not provided
    it  despite  a  direction  of  the  Tribunal  to  do  so.    In   those
    circumstances, I do not find that it is open to the Secretary of  State
    now to rely upon that evidence.  For those reasons,  it  has  not  been
    demonstrated that the judge made any material error of law and that  it
    was open to the judge to make the decision that he did on the  evidence
    that was placed before him.  Therefore the decision of the judge  shall
    stand.
