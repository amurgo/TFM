                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Steer  promulgated  18.6.15,  dismissing  their  linked
    appeals against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated  5.11.14,
    to refuse their applications made on 9.9.14 for leave to remain in  the
    UK as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur and dependent spouse, and  to  remove  them
    from the UK pursuant to  section  47  of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006. The Judge heard the appeals on 5.6.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    19.10.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 8.1.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Steer should be set aside.

 5. In granting permission to appeal Judge Hollingworth considered there to
    be an arguable error of law "in relation  to  the  construction  to  be
    placed upon  the  requirements  for  advertising  in  relation  to  the
    evidence adduced... It is arguable that the  Judge  should  have  dealt
    with the question of whether there was  a  breach  of  article  8.  The
    appeal was dismissed under the Immigration Rules."

 6. The first appellant was last issued on 10.9.12 with leave to remain  as
    a Tier 1 (Post Study) Migrant, valid until 10.9.14. The application  in
    issue was made on 9.9.14, and thus within valid leave.

 7. The first appellant's entrepreneur application was refused because  she
    failed to  qualify  for  the  necessary  25  points  under  Appendix  A
    Attributes. The issue is in relation to one of the  specified  evidence
    requirements under paragraph 41-SD(e), which require the  applicant  to
    submit particular forms of evidence with the application to demonstrate
    that the business in actively trading,  namely  "one  or  more  of  the
    following   specified   documents   [covering   (either   together   or
    individually) a continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014 up  to
    no earlier than three months before  the  date  of  his  application]:"
    There are then set out a list of four types of documents.

 8. The refusal decision stated, "The evidence that you have  submitted  in
    relation to advertising material is not acceptable as it does not cover
    a continuous period commencing before 11 July 2014, up  to  no  earlier
    than three months before the  date  of  your  application.  The  online
    advertisements from Gum Tree and leaflets you  have  supplied  are  not
    dated, therefore we are unable to confirm they were  advertised  before
    11 July 2014. You have not provided any evidence that you  qualify  for
    points under any of the other provisions of Table 4 of  Appendix  A  of
    the Rules and we  have  therefore  been  unable  to  award  points  for
    Attributes."

 9. Judge Steer stated at �15 of the decision  that  the  appellants  "were
    required to have provided, with the application,  documentary  evidence
    that they had advertised their business, which evidence covered a three-
    month period commencing before 11 July  2014.  The  three-month  period
    commenced on 9 June 2014."  Sadly,  that  was  a  misstatement  of  the
    requirements, which do not in fact require evidence  of  a  three-month
    period of advertising. The three months referenced in the Rules relates
    to the end of a continuous period which must commence  before  11  July
    2014 and end no earlier than 3 months before the application, which  in
    this case was 9.9.14. This is not necessarily a  three-month period and
    no particular length of period is specified. On the peculiar  facts  of
    this case, any evidence of advertising that  commenced  before  11.7.14
    and ended no earlier than 9.6.14 would suffice  as  far  as  length  of
    continuous period is concerned. Curiously, on the facts of  this  case,
    and  because  the  application  was  made  on  9.9.14,  any  period  of
    continuous advertising would  qualify,  provided  it  commenced  before
    11.7.14.

10. The judge went on to find at �20  that  the  appellants  provided  only
    advertising material in the form of flyers, and an invoice for printing
    of the flyers  dated  2.7.14.  However,  the  invoice  itself  was  not
    submitted with the application and should  not  have  been  taken  into
    consideration, because of section  85A  of  the  2002  Act.  The  judge
    concluded, however, that there was no  evidence  that  the  advertising
    took place on or around 2.7.14 and that  there  was  no  continuity  of
    advertising until the start of  the  Gumtree  advertisement  in  August
    2014. At �21 the judge found, "There was  no  documentary  evidence  of
    advertising from 9 June to  2  July  2014.  There  was  no  documentary
    evidence of advertising from 2 July to an unknown date in August  2014.
    The appellants have  therefore  failed  to  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 41-SD(e) and the appeal must be dismissed."

11. Whilst the reasoning was clearly  flawed,  for  the  reasons  explained
    above, I am satisfied, for the reasons set out herein, that even if the
    decision were to be set aside and remade, the outcome would be the same
    and thus there is no material error of law requiring the decision to be
    set aside.

12. I first reject the submission made by  the  appellants'  representative
    that there was no requirement for continuous advertising. The  evidence
    required under 41-SD(e)(iii) must cover a continuous period, commencing
    before 11.7.14. The evidence can form one or more of the  listed  types
    of documents set out under 41-SD(e)(iii), but on the facts of this case
    the appellants could only adduce the first, "advertising  or  marketing
    material, including printouts of  online  advertising,  that  has  been
    published  locally  or  nationally..."  Thus  the  appellants  had   to
    demonstrate a continuous period of published advertising. I reject  the
    submission made to me that  one  advertisement  is  in  and  of  itself
    continuous because it can be read ever after by  anyone  accessing  the
    advertising. Such an argument would make complete nonsense of  the  use
    of  the  word  continuous  in  the  Rule.  It  follows  that  a  single
    advertisement or a single distribution of a  leaflet  cannot  meet  the
    continuous period, shortened though it is because of the peculiar facts
    of this case and the date of application.

13. As at the date of application and indeed decision, neither  the  online
    Gumtree advertisement nor the leaflets were dated, and no  evidence  of
    date of publication had been provided with the  application,  and  thus
    the Secretary of State was unable to confirm that the advertising began
    before 11.7.14. In fact, on the evidence considered by the  judge,  the
    Gumtree advert did not take place until August  2014  and  thus  cannot
    itself meet the requirement.  At  the  appeal  hearing  the  appellants
    produced an invoice for flyers, suggesting that they had  been  printed
    and thus distributed around 2.7.14. As stated above, that  invoice  was
    not admissible and thus  the  reasons  for  the  Secretary  of  State's
    refusal decision are entirely well founded. There was  no  evidence  of
    continuous period of  advertising  of  any  length  and  no  admissible
    evidence to demonstrate any advertisement began before 11.7.14.

14. It follows that from the outset the application was doomed to  failure,
    because the evidence submitted did not meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules. Even if the decision were to be set aside and remade afresh, the
    appeal would still have to be dismissed on immigration grounds.

15. The Rule 24 reply, dated 5.11.15, does not address  the  issue  of  the
    advertising, the  author  not  having  had  sight  of  the  grounds  of
    application for permission to appeal. However, in relation to the issue
    of private and/or family life, it places  reliance  on  Sarkar  v  SSHD
    [2014] EWCA Civ 195 for authority  that  the  judge  did  not  need  to
    address article 8 at all if it was not raised in the hearing.

16. In relation to article 8 ECHR outside the Rules, the Secretary of State
    issued a one stop notice pursuant to section 120 of the 2002  Act.  The
    appellants were thus entitled to raise, as they did in their grounds of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, the claim that refusal is  a  breach
    of the private and family life rights of the appellants, stating,  "The
    appellants have lived lawfully in the UK for about  8  years  and  have
    made a contribution to the UK. They are married and have both a private
    life and a family life  in  the  UK.  The  refusal  is  unfair  and  is
    disproportionate and therefore breaches article 8. The case of  Gulshan
    applies: this is an exceptional case and the refusal is  unduly  harsh.
    The appellants are established within the UK and have been  refused  in
    an unfair manner."

17. However, the appellants' witness statements, dated 5.6.15, the  day  of
    the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,  address  only  the  issue
    under the Rules about missing evidence as to advertising. They  do  not
    address private or family life at all. Other than the fact  that  first
    appellant (wife) came to the UK as a student in August 2007 and,  after
    obtaining a Masters' degree in 2011, has set up a nursery and education
    consultancy business, and that the second appellant came to the  UK  in
    October 2008 and that he works for his wife in the business,  there  is
    nothing beyond the obvious that can be gleaned about their  private  or
    family life.

18. Although the First-tier Tribunal Judge referenced at �5 of the decision
    that in the alternative the grounds of appeal are  that  the  decisions
    were a breach of their right to private life in the UK, it is not clear
    to me that article 8 was pursued at all at the hearing. The  record  of
    proceedings contains no reference to article 8 evidence or submissions.
    In the circumstances, following Sarkar, there was no error  of  law  in
    the omission of the  judge  to  specifically  address  article  8  ECHR
    outside the Rules.

19. In any event, I find that even if article 8 ECHR had been  specifically
    addressed in the decision, there was no evidence before the  First-tier
    Tribunal upon which the judge could  reasonably  have  found  that  the
    appellants' circumstances were such as to justify  a  consideration  of
    private and family life outside  the  Rules,  or  to  demonstrate  that
    either could meet either Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE, which  it  is
    conceded they could not, or that even if the  judge  had  proceeded  to
    make an article 8 ECHR Razgar stepped  assessment  and  proportionality
    assessment, balancing on the one hand the rights of the appellants  and
    on the other  the  legitimate  and  necessary  aim  of  protecting  the
    economic well-being of the UK through immigration control,  that  there
    was anything disproportionate or otherwise  unjustifiably  harsh  about
    the removal decision.

20. In any such assessment the judge would have also had to take account of
    section 117B of the 2002 Act; in particular that immigration control is
    in the public interest, and that little weight should  be  given  to  a
    private life developed in the UK when the  immigration  status  of  the
    appellants, whilst lawful, was always  precarious,  dependent  as  they
    were on obtaining further leave to remain under the Immigration  Rules.
    The appellants would be able to continue their private life in Nigeria,
    where they have spent the most of their lives and to  where  they  must
    have expected to eventually return on completion of studies.  They  had
    no legitimate expectation of being able to remain in the UK.

21. In the circumstances, I find that there was no  error  of  law  in  the
    alleged omission of the judge to address article  8  ECHR  private  and
    family life.

22. The appeal of the first appellant thus fails on all grounds. The appeal
    of the second appellant as dependant of his wife must fall with that of
    the first appellant.

Conclusions:

23. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of  each  appellant  remains  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal of each appellant has been dismissed and thus there  can
be no fee award.
