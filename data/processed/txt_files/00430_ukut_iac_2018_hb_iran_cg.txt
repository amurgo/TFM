              COUNTRY GUIDANCE

    (1)  SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016]
        UKUT 308 (IAC) remains valid country guidance in terms of the
        country guidance offered in the headnote. For the avoidance of
        doubt, that decision is not authority for any proposition in
        relation to the risk on return for refused Kurdish asylum-seekers on
        account of their Kurdish ethnicity alone.

    (2)  Kurds in Iran face discrimination. However, the evidence does not
        support a contention that such discrimination is, in general, at
        such a level as to amount to persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.



    (3)  Since 2016 the Iranian authorities have become increasingly
        suspicious of, and sensitive to, Kurdish political activity. Those
        of Kurdish ethnicity are thus regarded with even greater suspicion
        than hitherto and are reasonably likely to be subjected to
        heightened scrutiny on return to Iran.

    (4)  However, the mere fact of being a returnee of Kurdish ethnicity
        with or without a valid passport, and even if combined with illegal
        exit, does not create a risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-
        treatment.

    (5)  Kurdish ethnicity is nevertheless a risk factor which, when
        combined with other factors, may create a real risk of persecution
        or Article 3 ill-treatment. Being a risk factor it means that
        Kurdish ethnicity is a factor of particular significance when
        assessing risk. Those "other factors" will include the matters
        identified in paragraphs (6)-(9) below.

    (6)  A period of residence in the KRI by a Kurdish returnee is
        reasonably likely to result in additional questioning by the
        authorities on return. However, this is a factor that will be highly
        fact-specific and the degree of interest that such residence will
        excite will depend, non-exhaustively, on matters such as the length
        of residence in the KRI, what the person concerned was doing there
        and why they left.

    (7)  Kurds involved in Kurdish political groups or activity are at risk
        of arrest, prolonged detention and physical abuse by the Iranian
        authorities. Even Kurds expressing peaceful dissent or who speak out
        about Kurdish rights also face a real risk of persecution or Article
        3 ill-treatment.

    (8)  Activities that can be perceived to be political by the Iranian
        authorities include social welfare and charitable activities on
        behalf of Kurds. Indeed, involvement with any organised activity on
        behalf of or in support of Kurds can be perceived as political and
        thus involve a risk of adverse attention by the Iranian authorities
        with the consequent risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.

    (9)  Even 'low-level' political activity, or activity that is perceived
        to be political, such as, by way of example only, mere possession of
        leaflets espousing or supporting Kurdish rights, if discovered,
        involves the same risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.
        Each case however, depends on its own facts and an assessment will
        need to be made as to the nature of the material possessed and how
        it would be likely to be viewed by the Iranian authorities in the
        context of the foregoing guidance.

   (10)  The Iranian authorities demonstrate what could be described as a
        'hair-trigger' approach to those suspected of or perceived to be
        involved in Kurdish political activities or support for Kurdish
        rights. By 'hair-trigger' it means that the threshold for suspicion
        is low and the reaction of the authorities is reasonably likely to
        be extreme.

                            DECISION AND REASONS


    INTRODUCTION

The appellant is a citizen of Iran, born in 1988, and is of Kurdish
ethnicity.  This decision gives country guidance in relation to the
following question, namely "whether a failed asylum seeker of Kurdish
ethnicity will be at risk of persecution on return".

Although in the parties' various written submissions there were mildly
different iterations of the country guidance issue, the country guidance
question was and is as expressed in the preceding paragraph, as agreed by
the parties at the hearing before us.

There was before us a statement of agreed facts which was, ultimately,
confirmed by the parties as agreed between them at the hearing on 25 May
2018.

The statement of agreed facts is reproduced here in full, with the only
editing being that in relation to the appellant's full date of birth.  The
agreed facts are as follows:

         "1.  The appellant is of Kurdish ethnicity.  He  was  his  parents'
             only child, born [in] 1988 in Betoosh,  Sardasht,  Iran.   His
             father was a shepherd, his mother a housewife.   In  1994  his
             parents disappeared.  The  appellant  believes  that  this  is
             because they were arrested by the authorities for  involvement
             in Kurdish nationalist activities.  At or around the same time
             there was  a  fire  at  his  family  home,  during  which  the
             appellant suffered burns injuries.

         2.   The appellant was taken by his uncle to Iraq, where he grew up
             undocumented.  He was bullied and harassed by  others  in  the
             village due to a disability in his legs and the fact  that  he
             was an outsider.  When he reached  adulthood  he  returned  to
             Iran, where, with his uncle's assistance, he raised  money  to
             pay for his journey abroad by the sale of his family land.  He
             left Iran illegally on 1 September 2015, reaching  the  United
             Kingdom in early July 2016.

         3.    The  appellant  claims  he  cannot  live   undocumented   and
             discriminated against  in  Iraq  -  where  he  does  not  have
             citizenship or right to reside - and he cannot return to  Iran
             given  his  family's  claimed  involvement  with   pro-Kurdish
             separatist groups."

The appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision dated 19 December
2016 to refuse his protection claim, came before First-tier Tribunal Judge
Nicholls ("the FtJ") at a hearing on 27 January 2017 whereby his appeal was
dismissed.  In a decision promulgated on 31 May 2017 Upper Tribunal Judge
Storey found an error of law in Judge Nicholls' decision and set his
decision aside, for the decision to be re-made in the Upper Tribunal
("UT").  Judge Storey's error of law decision is included as an annex to
our decision.

The agreed facts reflect the findings made by the FtJ, subject of course to
the matters that remain in dispute, and subject to further specific
reference to the FtJ's findings.   However, the FtJ found that the evidence
did not show that the appellant had been involved in any sur place
political activity which had drawn him to the adverse attention of the
authorities in Iran.  Thus, the anti-Iranian government messages that he
had claimed to have posted on Facebook would not expose him to risk.
Further, permission to appeal was granted only on the issue of whether a
failed asylum seeker of Kurdish ethnicity would be at risk of persecution
on return.

We heard oral evidence from two expert witnesses, Anna Enayat and Professor
Emile Joff�. They each provided written reports and written answers to
questions in writing from the respondent. Professor Joff�'s report is dated
14 October 2017 and that of Ms Enayat is dated 22 January 2018. Although
their evidence is summarised at Annex B, it essential to a full
understanding of this decision that full reference is made to the
summarised expert evidence. We make further reference to aspects of their
written and oral evidence in our conclusions.

We give a summary of the parties' submissions which is to be found at Annex
C. We make further reference to the submissions as appropriate in our
conclusions. So far as the written submissions are concerned, these are in
the parties' skeleton arguments provided in advance of the hearing, and
written submissions provided in advance of closing oral submissions. It is
the closing written submissions which we summarise since they crystallise
the parties' arguments with necessary references to the skeleton arguments.

Before hearing the oral evidence we considered an application made pursuant
to rule 15(2A)(a) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 to
admit additional evidence.  That evidence was of Facebook posts made by the
appellant both prior to and after the hearing before the First-tier
Tribunal ("FtT").

RULE 15(2A) APPLICATION

The documents which were the subject of the application are contained in a
bundle of 59 pages.  They are posts under the appellant's name and are
accompanied by translations of posts between 24 December 2016 and 16
January 2017.  The date range for the posts is 24 December 2016 to 16
January 2017 (pre-FtT hearing) and 23 February 2017 to 23 October 2017
(post-FtT hearing), the latter not being accompanied by translations. The
written application to admit the evidence, dated 19 February 2018, refers
to the appellant having given evidence before the FtT of posting material
on Facebook, a matter referred to by the FtJ at [16] of his decision.  The
application states that the posts had been translated on 26 January 2017
for the purpose of the FtT hearing but were not served and only came into
the possession of the appellant's representatives on 19 February 2018, the
date of the application.  The application to admit the evidence was
supported by a witness statement of counsel employed at the appellant's
solicitors, but not counsel who appeared before the FtT on behalf of the
appellant.

Summarising counsel's witness statement, it says that counsel had not seen
any Facebook evidence in the files that were passed to him when he took
over conduct of the appeal "although there was an attendance note pre-
dating the First-tier Tribunal hearing in which it is written that the
appellant was advised to download his Facebook posts".  The statement
continues that "The materiality of such evidence was not central to my
preparation of the evidence presented in the bundles for the Tribunal given
the subject matter of the appeal".  That was why he had not sought to
"trace" the evidence earlier.  The witness statement continues that once it
was realised that it would be important for the Tribunal to be fully aware
that the appellant's evidence in his witness statement in relation to
Facebook posts could be substantiated, he began to make enquiries of
counsel involved at the hearing before the FtT and of the appellant
himself. Counsel appearing before the FtT explained to him that he had not
been given any Facebook material and could not remember whether the
appellant himself had any with him on the day of the hearing.  It appears
then that there was some difficulty in counsel making contact with the
appellant by phone.

An interpreter from a translation agency was contacted who thought, but
could not remember clearly, that the Facebook posts had been translated.
Counsel states that unfortunately those translations were not provided to
him or to counsel at the hearing.  That the translations had in fact been
made was later confirmed with the translation agency.  The statement
continues that no-one from the agency could explain why the Facebook
evidence and translations were not made available to the appellant or his
then caseworker or counsel so that it could be served at his hearing.
The translations were apparently made the day before the FtT hearing.

In opposing the application to admit the evidence Mr Metcalfe observed that
the witness statement in support of the application does not say anything
about the timeframe relative to when it was discovered that this material
was potentially relevant.  Further, it was apparent from the skeleton
argument before the FtT and AB and Others (internet activity - state of
evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT 257 that Facebook material was to be relied
upon.  Both the author of the witness statement and counsel appearing
before the FtT would have been aware of the significance of that material.
There was no explanation as to why the material was translated but not
adduced in evidence before the FtT.

It was further submitted that it was not appropriate to allow that evidence
to be admitted now, particularly in the context of the hearing being a
country guidance case.  There had been no notice of the application and no
opportunity to consider the material in any detail.  It was inappropriate
and unfair for the material to be admitted now.  In relation to the
Facebook posts post-hearing, those, it was argued, were surely a matter for
further submissions in due course.

Ms Naik submitted that it was clear from the appellant's witness statement
that his case has always been that there were Facebook posts to be taken
into account. The FtJ's decision accepted that there was such material at
[16]-[17].  Furthermore, on behalf of the appellant no issue had been taken
in relation to the late service of the respondent's skeleton argument or
the agreed facts statement.  The appellant's account that he had shared
material on Facebook was accepted by the FtJ.

It was submitted that in deciding the appellant's appeal we would be
assisted by the material sought to be adduced given that this was the first
day of the hearing and there would be ample opportunity for questioning of
experts on that material.  It could not have been admitted before.  That
the material was not relied on at the hearing before the FtT could not be
explained any further.  The appellant's internet activity is significant in
terms of risk on return.

We decided to allow the new evidence to be admitted, having considered rule
15(2A) which provides as follows:

"In an asylum case or an immigration case -

(a)      if a party wishes the Upper Tribunal to consider evidence that was
not before the First-tier Tribunal, that party must send or deliver a
notice to the Upper Tribunal and any other party -


(i)   indicating the nature of the evidence; and


(ii)  explaining why it was not submitted to the First-tier Tribunal; and



(b)  when considering whether to admit evidence that was not before the
First-tier Tribunal, the Upper Tribunal must have regard to whether there
has been unreasonable delay in producing that evidence."

We should say that the explanation provided as to why the evidence was not
adduced before the FtT was rather weak.  The assertion by the author of the
witness statement in support of the application that the materiality of the
evidence was not central to his preparation of the case is rather
surprising given the nature of the evidence in the context of an asylum
claim from an Iranian national.  Nevertheless, the evidence is potentially
of great significance and is a matter which we have balanced against the
explanation for the evidence arising prior to the hearing before the FtT
not having been adduced previously, and the post-FtT evidence not having
been flagged up earlier. We have also considered the issue of "unreasonable
delay". Further, we took the view that given the timetable for the hearing
before us, there was sufficient time for the respondent to consider that
material such as would allow for the matters to be canvassed in cross-
examination of the expert witnesses and for submissions to be made on it.

    EXISTING COUNTRY GUIDANCE AND RELATED CASES

As of 26 June 2018 there are 19 country guidance cases on Iran from the UT
or its predecessor the Immigration and Asylum Tribunal. They date from 2002
to 2016, representing therefore, over a decade of judicial guidance on the
assessment of protection claims from Iran. The range of issues covered is
broad, dealing with, amongst other things, prison conditions, adultery,
homosexuality, religion and ethnicity.

In the light of the above, we can say two things. First, the nature of the
'regime' in Iran,  can, to some extent at least, be taken as read, in terms
of its human rights record, subject to evidence about recent developments.
Second, that we do not consider it necessary to refer to every one of those
country guidance cases in dealing with the issues that arise in this
appeal. We only need refer in this section, which encapsulates the most
recent country guidance, to some of those cases which were referred to by
the parties as being of particular relevance, and which we too consider
pertinent to the issues. For each of the cases we set out its guidance.

The decision in AB and Others is categorically not country guidance; it
does not have that designation. However, it is a reported case in terms of
the evidence that was before the Tribunal and both parties referred to it
in that context. It is appropriate to include it in this section although
noting that it is not country guidance.

The cases:


    SB (risk on return-illegal exit) Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053


    (i)                 Events  in  Iran  following  the   12   June   2009
          presidential elections have led  to  a  government  crackdown  on
          persons seen to be opposed to  the  present  government  and  the
          Iranian judiciary has become even less independent.  Persons  who
          are likely to be perceived by the authorities in  Iran  as  being
          actively associated with  protests against the June  12  election
          results  may face a real risk of persecution  or  ill  treatment,
          although much will depend on the particular circumstances.


    (ii)            Iranians facing enforced return do not in general  face
          a real risk of persecution or  ill-treatment.  That  remains  the
          case even if they  exited  Iran  illegally.  Having  exited  Iran
          illegally is not a significant risk factor, although if it is the
          case that a person would face difficulties with  the  authorities
          for other reasons, such a history could be a factor adding to the
          level of difficulties he or she is likely to face.

    (iii)          Being a person who  has  left  Iran  when  facing  court
          proceedings (other than ordinary civil  proceedings)  is  a  risk
          factor,  although  much  will  depend  on  the  particular  facts
          relating to the nature  of  the  offence(s)  involved  and  other
          circumstances. The more the offences for  which  a  person  faces
          trial are likely to be viewed as political, the greater the level
          of risk likely to arise as a result. Given  the  emphasis  placed
          both by the expert report from  Dr  Kakhki  and  the  April  2009
          Danish fact-finding report's   sources  on  the  degree  of  risk
          varying according to the nature of the court  proceedings,  being
          involved in ongoing court proceedings is not in itself  something
          that will automatically result in  ill-treatment;  rather  it  is
          properly to be considered as a  risk  factor  to  be  taken  into
          account along with others.

    (iv)          Being a person involved in court proceedings in Iran  who
          has engaged in conduct likely to be seen as insulting  either  to
          the judiciary or the justice system or the government or to Islam
          constitutes another risk factor indicating an increased level  of
          risk of persecution or ill treatment on return.

    (v)            Being accused  of  anti-Islamic  conduct  likewise  also
          constitutes a significant risk factor.

    (vi)          This case replaces AD (Risk-Illegal  Departure)  Iran  CG
          [2003] UKAIT 00107.







  BA (Demonstrators in Britain - risk on return) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 36
    (IAC)

    1    Given the large numbers of those who   demonstrate  here  and  the
         publicity which demonstrators receive,  for  example  on  Facebook,
         combined with the inability of the Iranian  Government  to  monitor
         all returnees  who  have  been  involved  in  demonstrations  here,
         regard must be had to the level of involvement  of  the  individual
         here as well as any political activity which the  individual  might
         have been involved in Iran before  seeking asylum in Britain.


    2 (a)     Iranians returning  to  Iran  are  screened  on  arrival.   A
         returnee who meets the profile of an activist may be detained while
         searches of documentation are made.  Students,  particularly  those
         who have known political profiles are likely to  be  questioned  as
         well as those who have exited illegally.

    (b)  There is not a real risk of persecution for those who have  exited
         Iran  illegally  or  are  merely  returning   from   Britain.   The
         conclusions of the Tribunal in the  country  guidance  case  of  SB
         (risk on return -illegal exit)  Iran  CG  [2009]  UKAIT  00053  are
         followed and endorsed.


    (c)  There is no evidence of the use of facial  recognition  technology
         at the Imam Khomeini International airport, but there are a  number
         of officials who may be able to recognize up to 200  faces  at  any
         one time. The procedures  used  by  security  at  the  airport  are
         haphazard. It is therefore possible  that  those  whom  the  regime
         might wish to question would not  come  to  the  attention  of  the
         regime on arrival. If, however, information is  known  about  their
         activities abroad, they might well be  picked  up  for  questioning
         and/or transferred to a special court near the  airport  in  Tehran
         after they have returned home.

    3    It is important to consider the  level  of  political  involvement
         before considering the likelihood of the individual coming  to  the
         attention of the authorities and  the  priority  that  the  Iranian
         regime would give to tracing him.  It  is  only  after  considering
         those factors that the issue of whether or not there is a real risk
         of his facing persecution on return can be assessed.

    4    The following are relevant factors to be considered when assessing
         risk on return having regard to sur place activities:


        (i) Nature of sur place activity


         .           Theme of demonstrations - what  do  the  demonstrators
            want  (e.g.  reform  of  the  regime  through  to  its  violent
            overthrow); how will they be characterised by the regime?
        .            Role in demonstrations and political profile - can the
            person be described as a leader; mobiliser (e.g. addressing the
            crowd), organiser (e.g. leading  the  chanting);  or  simply  a
            member of the crowd; if the latter  is  he  active  or  passive
            (e.g. does he carry a banner); what is his motive, and is  this
            relevant to the profile he will have in the eyes of the regime?
        .            Extent of participation - has the person attended  one
            or two demonstrations or is he a regular participant?
        .            Publicity attracted - has  a  demonstration  attracted
            media coverage in the  United  Kingdom  or  the  home  country;
            nature of that publicity  (quality  of  images;  outlets  where
            stories appear etc)?


        (ii) Identification risk


        .            Surveillance of demonstrators -  assuming  the  regime
            aims to identify demonstrators against it how does  it  do  so,
            through, filming them, having agents who mingle in  the  crowd,
            reviewing images/recordings of demonstrations etc?
        .            Regime's capacity to identify individuals -  does  the
            regime have advanced technology (e.g. for facial  recognition);
            does it allocate human resources to fit names to faces  in  the
            crowd?


        (iii) Factors triggering inquiry/action on return


          .         Profile - is the person known as a committed opponent or
           someone with a  significant  political  profile;  does  he  fall
           within  a  category  which  the  regime  regards  as  especially
           objectionable?
        .           Immigration history - how  did  the  person  leave  the
           country (illegally; type of visa); where  has  the  person  been
           when abroad; is the timing and method of return more  likely  to
           lead to inquiry and/or being detained  for  more  than  a  short
           period and ill-treated (overstayer; forced return)?


        (iv) Consequences of identification


        .             Is   there   differentiation   between   demonstrators
           depending on the level of their political profile adverse to the
           regime?


        (v) Identification risk on return


       .            Matching identification to person  -  if  a  person  is
           identified is that information systematically stored  and  used;
           are border posts geared to the task?




        SA (Iranian Arabs-no general risk) Iran CG [2011] UKUT 00041


        The Iranian state is suspicious of those Iranian  citizens  who  are
        also Arabs and regards London as a centre  of  separatist  activity.
        Being an Iranian Arab returned  from  the  United  Kingdom  enhances
        other risk factors but an Iranian Arab does not risk persecution  or
        other ill treatment solely by reason of ethnicity.




        SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum  seeker)  Iran  (CG)  [2016]
        UKUT 308 (IAC)


        (a) An Iranian male whom it is sought to return to  Iran,  who  does
        not possess a passport, will be  returnable  on  a  laissez  passer,
        which he can obtain from the Iranian Embassy on  proof  of  identity
        and nationality.


        (b) An Iranian male in respect  of  whom  no  adverse  interest  has
        previously been manifested by the Iranian State does not face a real
        risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights on return to Iran
        on account of having left  Iran  illegally  and/or  being  a  failed
        asylum seeker. No such risk exists at the  time  of  questioning  on
        return to Iran nor after the facts (i.e. of illegal exit and being a
        failed asylum seeker) have been established. In particular, there is
        not a real risk of prosecution leading to imprisonment.




        AB and Others (internet activity - state of  evidence)  [2015]  UKUT
        257 (IAC)


        The material put before the tribunal did not disclose  a  sufficient
        evidential basis for giving country or  other  guidance  upon  what,
        reliably, can be expected in terms of  the  reception  in  Iran  for
        those returning otherwise than with a "regular" passport in relation
        to whom interest may be excited from the authorities  into  internet
        activity as might be revealed by an examination of blogging activity
        or a Facebook account. However, this determination  is  reported  so
        that the evidence considered by the Upper Tribunal is  available  in
        the public domain.

     THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK-COUNTRY GUIDANCE STATUS

The Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and the
Upper Tribunal Practice Directions provide as follows in relation to
country guidance decisions:

         "12. Starred and Country Guidance determinations
         ...

         12.2 A reported determination of  the  Tribunal,  the  AIT  or  IAT
             bearing the letters 'CG' shall be treated as an  authoritative
             finding on  the  country  guidance  issue  identified  in  the
             determination, based upon the evidence before the  members  of
             the Tribunal, the AIT or the IAT that  determine  the  appeal.
             As a result,  unless  it  has  been  expressly  superseded  or
             replaced by any later 'CG' determination, or  is  inconsistent
             with other authority that is binding on the Tribunal,  such  a
             country guidance  case  is  authoritative  in  any  subsequent
             appeal, so far as that appeal:-


             (a)  relates to the country guidance issue in question; and


             (b)  depends upon the same or similar evidence.


             ...


         12.4     Because of the principle that like cases should be treated
             in like manner, any failure  to  follow  a  clear,  apparently
             applicable country guidance case or to show why  it  does  not
             apply to the case in question is  likely  to  be  regarded  as
             grounds for appeal on a point of law."

The UT Guidance Note 2011 No.2 on the reporting of UT decisions (as amended
in July 2015) adds at [11] that:

         "If there is credible fresh evidence relevant to the issue that has
         not been considered in the Country Guidance case or, if a
         subsequent case includes further issues that have not been
         considered in the CG case, the judge will reach the appropriate
         conclusion on the evidence, taking into account the conclusion in
         the CG case so far as it remains relevant."

On the question of country guidance, one finds the following in CM (EM
country guidance; disclosure) Zimbabwe CG [2013] UKUT 59 (IAC) at [58]:

          "It is of importance to note that a Country Guidance case is only
          authoritative in so far as the evidence in any subsequent appeal
          is the same or similar. It is thus not a binding precedent that
          can only be varied by the Upper Tribunal or the higher courts.
          Where the evidence is materially different it is the duty of the
          judge of the First -tier Tribunal to evaluate it and reach his or
          her own conclusion, but in doing so he or she will start from the
          last extant Country Guidance case and see what if anything has
          changed."

    COUNTRY BACKGROUND-HUMAN RIGHTS

    General

We said at [20] above that the nature of the 'regime' in Iran to some
extent can be taken as read in terms of its human rights record, subject to
evidence about recent developments. The ground is well trodden in the
country guidance cases, in their guidance and in the expert evidence put
before them.

In addition, we need do no more than quote in a limited way from the
following reports. First, the Report of the (UN) Special Rapporteur on the
situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Human
Rights Council dated 17 March 2017 ("report of the UN Special Rapporteur")
as follows:

          "3. ...the Government has still not accepted the requests made
          since 2002 by the Special Rapporteurs on the independence of
          lawyers and judges; extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
          executions; freedom of religion or belief; minority issues; and
          the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion
          and expression; as well as the Working Groups on the issue of
          discrimination against women in law and in practice; Enforced or
          Involuntary Disappearances; and Arbitrary Detention.

          4.  The Special Rapporteur regrets that the information she
          received did not reveal any notable improvement in the situation
          of human rights in the country. The situation relating to
          independence of judges and lawyers, freedom of expression and use
          of arbitrary detention continues to be a matter of serious
          concern. She notes that some measures are under way, but their
          implementation and effectiveness is yet to be assessed.

          ...

          24. The Government did not [accept] any of the 20  recommendations
          regarding torture or other cruel, inhuman or  degrading  treatment
          or punishment made during the 2014 universal periodic review.

          ...

          26. Since her appointment, the  Special  Rapporteur  has  received
          numerous reports about the use of torture and other cruel, inhuman
          or degrading treatment or punishment. These  include  amputations,
          blinding and flogging as forms of punishment, physical and  mental
          torture or ill-treatment  to  coerce  confessions  (mostly  during
          pretrial detention), prolonged periods of solitary confinement and
          denial of access to proper and  necessary  medical  treatment  for
          detainees."


Second, the Report of the Secretary-General to the UN on the Situation of
human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, dated 31 October 2017 as
follows:

          "5.   Since the report of the Secretary-General to the thirty-
          fourth session of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/34/40), [30
          March 2017] the situation of human rights has been marked by a
          crackdown against human rights defenders, journalists and users of
          social media in the lead up to the presidential elections. The
          application of the death penalty, including for children in
          conflict with the law, has continued at a high rate. The United
          Nations human rights mechanisms have continued to receive numerous
          allegations of cases of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading
          treatment, arbitrary detention and unfair trials. United Nations
          human rights mechanisms have also continued to receive information
          relating to persistent discrimination against women and the
          continued persecution of members of religious and ethnic minority
          groups. Limited progress has been observed during the reporting
          period in the implementation of the Citizen Rights Charter adopted
          in December 2016".

    Kurds


Below we give a summary of some of the background material before us in
relation to the human rights issues that arise in Iran for those of Kurdish
ethnicity.

The report of the UN Special Rapporteur states the following:

         "79. Violations of the rights of ethnic minorities continue to be
           reported in the country. Almost one fifth of the executions
           carried out in Iran in 2016 concerned Kurdish prisoners.  Among
           those executions, 21 were related to the crime of "moharebeh"
           (waging war against God and the State) and 1 to membership in a
           Kurdish political party. Kurdish political prisoners are said to
           represent almost half of the total number of political prisoners
           in the country.

         80.  The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about the
           alleged indiscriminate and blind use of lethal force towards
           Kurdish kulbaran (back carriers), which may be related to their
           ethnic affiliation. The kulbaran are Kurdish couriers who engage
           in smuggling commodities across the border. Due to the high rate
           of unemployment in Kurdistan provinces, this activity is
           generally the only way for them to provide for themselves and
           their family. In 2016, Iranian border security forces reportedly
           killed 51 kulbaran and injured 71 others, which is about twice
           as much as the previous year."

The Home Office Country Information and Guidance on Iran "Kurds and Kurdish
political groups" version 2.0, July 2016 ("CIG") contains the following
(with footnotes removed but which can be viewed in the original):

         3.1.1         Kurds in Iran face discrimination which affects their
             access to basic services. However, in general, this level of
             discrimination will not reach the level of being persecutory.

         3.1.2    Those involved in Kurdish political groups are however, at
             risk of arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention and physical
             abuse from the Iranian authorities.  Even those who express
             peaceful dissent or who speak out about Kurdish rights can be
             seen as a general threat and face a real risk of persecution.



         3.1.3    Family members of persons associated with a Kurdish
             political group are also harassed and detained and may be
             subject to inhumane treatment.

         3.1.4    Where a person can demonstrate to a reasonable degree of
             likelihood that they are known or likely to be made known to
             the Iranian authorities on the basis of their membership or
             perceived membership of a Kurdish political group they should
             be granted asylum.

         3.1.5    Internal relocation to avoid persecution is unlikely to be
         an available option.

         3.1.6    Where a claim falls to be refused, it is unlikely to be
             certifiable as 'clearly unfounded'.

              ...

         4.1.1. The CIA world fact book estimates the population to be
             approximately 81,824,270.  Iran is a multi-ethnic country. The
             largest ethnic community comprises Persians who constitute
             about 50-55% of the population. The rest of the population is
             combined of Kurds, Lurs, Azeris, Arabs, Armenians, and a host
             of other small ethnicities.  Estimates vary as to their
             numbers, but at up to 8 million, Iran's Kurdish population is
             second in size only to the Kurds in Turkey and probably larger
             than the Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish populations combined.

              ...

         5.2.3 The same source further noted that 'The activities that Kurds
             conduct that can be perceived as political activities include
             social welfare and solidarity activities.

         5.2.4 The Danish Refugee Council and Danish Immigration service
             fact finding mission on Iranian Kurds and Conditions for
             Iranian Kurdish Parties in Iran and KRI, Activities in the
             Kurdish Area of Iran, Conditions in Border Area and Situation
             of Returnees from KRI to Iran 30 May to 9 June 2013, dated 30
             September 2013 consulted a western diplomat and expert on Iran
             in Erbil who stated that; "being a Kurd in Iran does not
             necessarily mean getting into trouble with the authorities as
             has been the case in Syria.  Troubles will start as soon as a
             person gets involved in political activities".

              ...

         5.2.10 Asharq Al-Awsat reported in January 2016 that:

             'Kurdish opposition sources in Iran have revealed yesterday
             that the executions carried out by the Iranian regime against
             the Kurds and other components are increasing annually,
             indicating that during the past nine months, according to the
             Iranian calendar, Iran executed more than 750 people, the
             majority of whom were Kurdish.'

     5.2.11    In January 2016 Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN)
             published a report on the violation of Kolber workers in Iran.
              The report stated that

         'Kolber is a Kurdish name for workers and tradespersons, who for a
             small sum of money risk their lives to transport packs of
             various foreign items on their own back or on the back of
             horses to transfer them from and to Iranian border territories
             from border areas of neighbouring Kurdish regions in Iraq and
             Turkey.'

     5.2.12 The report went on to state that:

          'The Kolber workers mostly come from Kurdish border villages and
             towns, where they are usually left with no job other than
             Kolber work to make a small income to survive through the
             harsh reality of the deprived Kurdish border areas. However,
             the Iranian government describes them as "smugglers", while
             Iranian soldiers and border guards deliberately shoots to kill
             them across the border areas.'

      5.2.13  Jane's 'Sentinel Security Assessment' noted that 'there is
              growing anger in Iran's Kurdish community over the number of
              Kurds executed in Iran amid allegations that torture is
              widespread.'

      5.2.14 The US Congressional Research Service reported that:

         'the Kurdish language is not banned, but schools do not teach it
              and Kurdish political organizations, activists, and media
              outlets are routinely scrutinized, harassed, and closed down
              for supporting greater Kurdish autonomy. Several Kurdish
              oppositionists have been executed since 2010.'

      5.2.15 According to the 2015 US State Department Human Rights report
              for Iran:

         'The estimated eight million ethnic Kurds in the country
              frequently campaigned for greater regional autonomy. The
              government continued to use security law, the media law, and
              other legislation to arrest and prosecute Kurds for
              exercising their rights to freedom of expression and
              association.

              The government reportedly banned Kurdish-language newspapers,
              journals, and books and punished publishers, journalists, and
              writers for opposing and criticizing government policies.
              Authorities suppressed legitimate activities of Kurdish NGOs
              by denying them registration permits or bringing security
              charges against persons working with such organizations. The
              government did not allow Kurds to register most Kurdish names
              for their children in official registries. Authorities did
              not prohibit speaking the Kurdish language, but authorities
              prohibited most schools from teaching it.

At section 11 of the CIG entitled "Treatment of Kurdish political activists
and family members" considerable detail is given. It is not necessary for
us to quote the whole section; a selection suffices to reveal the import of
this part of the CIG. Thus, there is the following:

         11.1.1  The Danish Refugee Council and Danish Immigration Service's
             joint fact finding mission of September 2013 met with various
             sources who stated that:

             "A Western diplomat and expert on Iran in Erbil explained that
             there is no tolerance on the Iranian regime's side for any
             kind of activities with connection to the Kurdish political
             parties and any affiliation with one of these parties would be
             reason for arrest. The main reason for this is that these
             parties' ultimate goal, despite their non-violent opposition,
             is a change in the regime of Iran which is much worse than
             support for the Green Movement which aims for reforms within
             the existing system".

              '...The Western diplomat and expert on Iran in Erbil informed
             the delegation that the execution rate is high among Kurds in
             Iran. A large part of these executions are based on accusation
             of drug smuggling.  Sometimes political activists are executed
             under the pretext of being drug smugglers.

              '...Mustafa Moloudi (KDP-Iran) explained that some of the
             (KDPI) party members who had been conducting secret activities
             in Iran were caught by the regime. While some of them were
             executed and some were freed after a period of detention,
             others were exchanged. However, those who were freed lost
             their public jobs, for instance if they were working as
             teacher, and they were not allowed to work anymore in the
             public sector'.

              '...Regarding punishment for being a member of Komala,
             Ebrahim Alizadeh (Komala, SKHKI) told the delegation that if a
             Komala cell member is arrested by the Iranian regime, he will
             be tortured, imprisoned for life or even executed. As regards
             the consequences for the cell member's family, Alizadeh
             explained that his family members may be arrested, but they
             will be freed on bail after a while'.

              '...According to Ziryan Roj Helaty (Tanupo Magazine), the
             Iranian regime is highly sensitive to the Kurdish population
             in Iran, and the regime always reacts  disproportionately
             towards activities conducted by Kurds. As a result, if the
             Iranian regime for instance catches a sympathizer carrying out
             an activity against the government, the consequences for him
             and his family will be serious'.

             '...Ziryan Roj Helaty also stated that anything related to
             KDPI, even talking about the Kurdish people and their rights
             could create a problem. Someone who talks directly about KDPI
             is, in the eyes of the regime, affiliated with KDPI, and a
             person speaking about Kurdish rights is seen as a general
             threat.  ... Kurdish patriotism that has spread throughout the
             Middle East in recent years, may also reach Iran, and this is
             exactly what the regime in Iran fears'. '...According to UNHCR
             in Erbil, persons with a high political profile as well as
             human rights activists are targeted. ... Members of KDPI will
             get approximately two to ten years of prison if they are
             arrested by the Iranian authorities. Based on information from
             asylum seekers, KDPI members will be tortured during pre-trial
             detention in order to confess and disclose names of other KDPI
             members. The duration of the detention will typically be from
             one to six months depending on the level of the detainee's
             engagement. The sentence which is imprisonment will depend on
             the level of the engagement of the person and the evidence
             that are (sic) presented against him'.

         11.1.4 The Austrian report [compiled] by the Federal Ministry of
             the Interior on Kurds: History -Religion - Language - Politics
             dated November 2015 noted that: 'The mere presumption of being
             a member of any of these parties can lead to long-term prison
             sentences. Many Kurds are among the victims of political
             persecution with frequent charges of terrorism - in particular
             the alleged support of PJAK - and often disproportionate
             degrees of punishment.'

          11.1.5 On 10 November 2015, International campaign for human
             rights in Iran reported on a Sunni Kurd who was facing
             execution.  The report noted that:  Shahram Ahmadi has been
             sentenced to death in Iran due to his activism as a Sunni
             Muslim and a Kurd.  Members of ethnic or religious minorities
             in Iran who engage in criticism of the government are singled
             out by authorities for particularly harsh treatment, and there
             is a well-documented history of the Judiciary
             disproportionately meting out capital punishment to minority
             activists.   "Making speeches, distributing books and
             pamphlets, or opposing the government are not capital
             offenses. Unfortunately Judge Moghisseh said that Shahram's
             first two crimes are that he's a Sunni and a Kurd. Therefore
             he was presumed guilty from the start," a source told the
             International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran.

      ASSESSMENT AND CONCLUSIONS-COUNTRY GUIDANCE

     (i) SSH and HR; a starting point?

 1. To reiterate, the guidance in SSH and HR is as follows:

         "(a) An Iranian male whom it is sought to return to Iran, who  does
             not possess a  passport,  will  be  returnable  on  a  laissez
             passer, which he can obtain from the Iranian Embassy on  proof
             of identity and nationality.

         (b)  An Iranian male in respect of whom  no  adverse  interest  has
             previously been manifested by the Iranian State does not  face
             a real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3  rights  on
             return to Iran on account of having left Iran illegally and/or
             being a failed asylum seeker. No such risk exists at the  time
             of questioning on return to Iran nor after the facts (i.e.  of
             illegal exit and being  a  failed  asylum  seeker)  have  been
             established. In particular,  there  is  not  a  real  risk  of
             prosecution leading to imprisonment."

 2. Plainly then, the Tribunal in that  case  did  not  offer  any  country
    guidance on the issue of Kurdish returnees, as Judge Storey  also  said
    in his error of law decision in this appeal.

 3. At [34] of SSH and HR it was stated that it was not suggested to the UT
    that an individual faces risk on return on  the  sole  basis  of  being
    Kurdish.

 4. However, in the same paragraph the UT went on to state as follows:

         "It was however agreed that being Kurdish was  relevant  to  how  a
         returnee would be treated by  the  authorities.  For  example,  the
         Operational Guidance Note  refers  at  3.12.14  to  the  government
         disproportionally targeting minority groups, including  Kurds,  for
         arbitrary  arrest,  prolonged  detention  and  physical  abuse.  No
         examples however have been provided of ill-treatment  of  returnees
         with no relevant adverse interest factors other than their  Kurdish
         ethnicity, and we conclude that the evidence does not show risk  of
         ill-treatment to such returnees, though we accept that it might  be
         an exacerbating factor for a returnee otherwise of interest."

The respondent contends that SSH and HR should be the 'starting point' for
consideration of the country guidance issue in this case. In written
submissions reliance is placed on the whole of [34] and the following
passage is emphasised:

         "Accordingly we conclude that it has not been shown that a person
         in the position of these appellants faces a real risk on return to
         Iran either on the basis of what would happen to them when
         questioned at the airport or subsequently if they were convicted of
         an offence of illegal exit."

It is also argued in the respondent's written submissions that in SSH and
HR the UT made its decision "by reference to extensive oral and written
evidence from Dr Mohammad Kakhki..." and that it considered specific
evidence from him on the treatment of Kurds (at [45]-[47] of the summary of
his evidence at Appendix 1).

The respondent's skeleton argument at [28] relies on what was said in MY
(Country Guidance cases, no fresh evidence ) Eritrea [2005] UKAIT 00158,
namely that "In a case depending...on the same or similar evidence, a party
will not be permitted to challenge the country guidance findings except by
the production of new evidence. Attempts to contest the findings in a CG
case without such fresh evidence are not permissible." However, apart from
the fact that SSH and HR was not considering the same country guidance
issue as arises in this case, the fact is that the appeal before us does
not depend on the same or similar evidence.

Of course it is true that some evidence concerning the risk to those
appellants as Kurdish returnees was considered but that evidence was
nowhere near as extensive as the evidence before us and the UT did not
purport to issue any guidance on the issue of Kurdish returnees.

We disagree with the proposition that SSH and HR should be the starting
point for us in this appeal in the sense that we should somehow find that
it is the foundation upon which our decision should be built. To do so
would be to imply that that decision is authority on the issue of risk to
Kurdish returnees as a distinct group, which it is not and does not purport
to be.

    (ii) The expert evidence-evaluation

We have no hesitation in accepting the expertise of both Anna Enayat and
Professor Joff� whose knowledge and experience of Iran and the Middle East
extends over many years, indeed decades. Their expertise has been
recognised by courts and tribunals on numerous occasions.

To the extent that the respondent suggested that the weight to be attached
to Professor Joff�'s evidence was diminished by reason of judicial
criticism from 2004 and earlier, we find no merit in that suggestion. The
circumstances and context were then completely different, quite apart from
the fact that that criticism is now of some vintage.

That is not to say that we consider ourselves bound to accept every aspect
of the experts' evidence. Where we have not done so we explain why.

Ms Enayat's evidence is that the CIG, which in part we have quoted above,
presents a "brief snapshot" of the situation in the Kurdish areas of Iran
between 2012 and early 2016. Her view is that developments since then have
seriously increased tensions in the predominantly Kurdish western provinces
in a manner which will mean that Kurds returned to Iran will now be
subjected to heightened suspicion and scrutiny. Her oral and written
evidence is that this is the result of the fighting in the Syrian war which
had raised national consciousness amongst Kurds. Also relevant she said,
was the resumption in 2016 of armed activities by Kurdish national parties
who had repudiated violence and which were an offshoot of the PKK
(Kurdistan Workers' Party), being the first major resurgence since the
1990's.  In addition, Kurds in the abortive independence referendum in the
KRI (Kurdistan Region of Iraq) mobilised the population in Kurdish cities
of Iran.  Lastly, the terrorist attack on the Iranian parliament in Tehran
in July 2017 was relevant where the perpetrators were Islamist Kurds.  The
Iranian security services rounded up Kurds in the Kurdish areas.  There was
therefore heightened security activity.

Professor Joff�'s evidence was to like effect. However, he also cited as
significant the new Political Crimes Law ("PCL") of 2016. In his written
answers to the respondent's written questions he refers to the PCL as
having come into force in June 2016. Citing an Amnesty International ("AI")
report dated 2016/2017 the PCL is described as a new law on Political
Crimes which criminalised all expression deemed to be "against the
management of the country and its political institutions and domestic and
foreign policies" and made "with intent to reform the affairs of the
country without intending to harm the basis of the establishment". A US
State Department report on Iran of 2017 is also quoted.

Professor Joff�'s evidence is that the burden is on the individual to show
that they are innocent. He said that it was probably in terms of its
implementation that the issue of the reverse burden of proof would be
apparent. However, in our view there is force in the respondent's
submission that there is no evidential foundation for Professor Joff�'s
view in terms of the reverse burden of proof. He was not able to give any
examples of the PCL having been interpreted or implemented in that way and
did not suggest that its terms, on their face, had that effect. Although he
said that it had been commented upon by NGO's and by the US State
Department especially, no such commentaries were identified. The article
from Legal Agenda entitled "Is Iran's New Law on Political Crimes a Step
Forward?" does not support Professor Joff�'s evidence on the issue.

We accept that as an expert Professor Joff� is entitled to give an opinion
on the effect of the PCL based on his knowledge and experience. However, we
are not satisfied that his opinion in this respect carries much weight in
circumstances where the basis for his opinion has not been demonstrated.

Having said that, we do not consider that the burden of proof question in
relation to the PCL is of much significance at all in relation to the
country guidance question in issue or in relation to this appellant's
appeal in particular.

Of far greater importance is the consistent evidence of both experts,
supported by sources and background evidence, in relation to the heightened
tensions in Iran in security terms both generally and in relation to those
of Kurdish ethnicity.

In TK (Tamils - LP updated) Sri Lanka CG [2009] UKAIT 00049 the Tribunal
made a distinction between risk categories and risk factors. At [4] the
distinction was explained thus:

         "In country guidance cases the Tribunal has a dual function.  As in
         every case, it must decide the appeal before it, but it also seeks
         to identify relevant risks that arise in relation to classes or
         groups of persons.  It does this in two main ways: (i) by
         identifying one or more "risk categories" (usually when the
         evidence is sufficiently clear-cut to justify a finding that the
         generality of persons in a particular category are at risk); (ii)
         by delineating "risk factors", i.e. factors of particular
         significance when assessing risk, a mode usually chosen when the
         evidence is less clear-cut."

At [122] of his report Professor Joff� states that:

         "...any Kurd returned to Iran must anticipate the serious risk of
         official discrimination or persecution simply on the grounds of his
         membership of an ethnic group, quite apart from any specific
         threats he or she might face for illegal exit from Iran or because
         there are specific charges outstanding against her or him."

     And at [123]:

         "...it seems to me that a person fleeing persecution as a result of
         both his ethnicity and the attitude of the Iranian authorities
         towards failed asylum-seekers, as stated in Kayhan on February 17
         and April 26, 2011, might legitimately anticipate a risk to himself
         which would allow him to apply for asylum on those grounds alone."

     Lastly in this context at [124] Professor Joff� states that the extent
    of discrimination against Kurds shows that "such discrimination is so
    severe that it amounts to persecution"

In his oral evidence he maintained that there was a real risk of
persecution for an individual simply on the basis of their being Kurdish,
stating that that was his inference from the evidence that he had seen.

Professor Joff� then, asserts that Kurdish ethnicity alone would amount to
a risk category (as the term is used in TK).

However, that is not in fact the appellant's case as advanced on his
behalf. At [3] of the appellant's skeleton argument it states that "it is
not being suggested in the instant case that Kurdish ethnicity constitutes
a risk category per se". There the appellant's case is that for Iranian
Kurds ethnicity is a risk factor which creates a risk of persecution when
combined with other factors. The position on behalf of the appellant as
expressed in closing written and oral submissions was to the same effect.
Thus in the appellant's written submissions at [14] it states that
"[c]ontrary to the implication of the Respondent's written submissions...it
is not the appellant's case that any failed Kurdish asylum seeker faces a
real risk of persecution simply by virtue of being Kurdish".

Ms Enayat's evidence was not to the effect that Kurdish ethnicity alone
creates a risk of persecution or that all failed asylum seekers of Kurdish
ethnicity were at such risk. In oral evidence she said that she was not
arguing that a Kurd, who was not perceived in some way to be politically
active, would be arrested. She pointed out that she had repeatedly said in
her report that targeting was not purely on the basis of Kurdish ethnicity.

In her report, in answer to the question of whether the Iranian government
imputes an anti-government political view to a person on account of their
Kurdish ethnicity alone she said that "The answer is, quite evidently, no".
However, she goes on to state that it is important to be wary of the
sometimes repeated opinion that Kurds are at risk only if they engage in
political activity. She then states that the COI [CIG] does not fall into
that error in that it refers to a range of activists or perceived
activists, including cultural activists, those who express peaceful dissent
or so much as speak about Kurdish rights, could be at risk. Thus, she
agrees with para 2.3.4 that:

           "If the Iranian regime catches a perceived sympathizer carrying
           out an activity perceived to be against the government, the
           consequences for him and his family can be result (sic) in
           arbitrary arrest, detention and possible ill-treatment."

The emphasis on perceived is that of Ms Enayat and she explains why,
stating that most country information on Kurds indicates that they are at
particular risk of imputed political opinion if for some reason they come
to the attention of the authorities.

The appellant's skeleton argument states at [99] that Professor Joff�
accepts that Kurdish ethnicity does not create a risk of persecution per
se. However, we do not think that that accurately captures his view in the
light of what he says at [124] of his report which we refer to above, and
in the light of his oral evidence to which we have also referred.

If Professor Joff� does take that view, we are not satisfied that the
evidence supports a contention that Kurdish ethnicity alone creates a risk
of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment on return. That is not a view
supported by the background evidence, it is inconsistent with Ms Enayat's
evidence and indeed we are not asked on behalf of the appellant so to
conclude.

We note Professor Joff�'s evidence in his report at [113] that he is
substantially in agreement with the conclusions in SSH and HR "if it were
not for two further considerations". He wonders whether the Tribunal in
that case overlooked two general aspects of the "current situation" in
Iran: the worsening security situation in parts of the country occupied
predominantly by one of the many ethnic or religious minorities and the
increased domestic tensions. He states that in his view the Tribunal "has
under-estimated the potential difficulties connected with the acquisition
of laissez-passer documentation."

His report then expands on those issues, concluding that there is
intensified repression of Kurds and that if a Kurdish returnee has given
rise to suspicions of anti-regime behaviour, either abroad or in Iran
before they left, "his prospects of avoiding persecution upon return will
have been significantly diminished". He goes on to state that he does not
feel that the decision in SSH and HR has paid sufficient attention to those
considerations which would now be intensified by Iranian Kurdish reaction
to the independence referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan. He also suggests that
those considerations have been neglected in the latest edition of the COI
[CIG].

Those views led to Professor Joff�'s conclusions which we have set out at
our [52]-[54] above and which we have rejected.

However, we have returned to Professor Joff�'s evidence on this in order to
explain why, in so far as Professor Joff� suggests it, we reject the
contention that SSH and HR is wrong in terms of its country guidance. In
the first place, we do not consider that Professor Joff�'s reasons provide
a sufficient basis for us to reconsider the guidance in SSH and HR.
Secondly, that is not a position argued for on behalf of the appellant and
was not the basis upon which the appeal before us was presented by either
party.

Thus, in the appellant's written submissions at [8] it states that the
appellant does not seek to disturb the country guidance findings in SSH and
HR and at [11] that it is the country guidance case for assessing asylum
claims that rely upon the unparticularised fact of having claimed asylum
abroad. In addition, we have already referred to the respondent's
suggestion that SSH and HR is the starting point for the assessment of the
appellant's claim, a suggestion which we have rejected for the reasons
given. Lastly, at [12] of the written submissions it is expressly stated
that the appellant is not seeking to go behind the country guidance in SSH
and HR.

We are firm in concluding that the country guidance given in SSH and HR
remains valid.

    (iii) Returns

As regards returnees and what, if anything, can be deduced from the numbers
of those returned, on behalf of the appellant it is observed in the
skeleton argument that the figures for returns clearly show that some
failed asylum seekers from Iran do go back. It is nevertheless said that
the figures are unrevealing although certain trends can be observed it is
suggested. The figures for returns referred to come from tables rt_01 and
rt_05 at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-statistics-
july-to-september-2017. The tables on the UK government website require the
application of the filters in order to obtain the figures for Iran. We
think that there are minor errors in the table in the appellant's skeleton
argument as compared to the government tables, namely for asylum claims
from Iran in 2013 (2,410 not 2,417); 2016 (4,184 not 4,192) and total
claims in 2016 (30,747 and not 30,603), although these are simple mistakes
and not significant.

On behalf of the appellant it is said that from 2006 to 2014 the UK
government's figures reveal that claims for asylum in the UK by Iranian
nationals ran at an annual average of 2,234, ranging from 1,834 to 2,659.
It is said that since then there had been "a dramatic increase" in claims,
from 3,242 claims in 2015 to 4,192 in 2016 (the correct figure is 4,184 we
think).

However, we do not accept the implied suggestion that what is described as
a dramatic increase in the number of claims from Iran equates, necessarily,
to evidence that there are more individuals from Iran in need of
international protection. There is no necessary correlation between the
two. An increase in claims could be due to various factors, and without any
speculation one could suggest, for example, that economic circumstances in
Iran may be relevant, or a change in destination of choice, say from some
other European country, or unknown factors in terms of the actions of
people smugglers. In addition, what we say below about the lack of
information about the particulars of those returned to Iran could be said
to apply with equal force in terms of the basis upon which the claims for
international protection were made by the 'increased number' of claimants.
In other words, in the context of country guidance in relation to those of
Kurdish ethnicity from Iran, the fact that it is not known how many of
those applying for asylum were Kurdish means that little, if anything, of
relevance can be deduced from the numbers in that context.

What can be seen is that 2016 saw the highest number of asylum claims from
Iran since 2001 which appears from the government tables to be the date
from when figures appear by country of origin. However, it is also the case
that there has been a certain ebb and flow in the number of claims from
Iran. Thus, purely by way of examples, in 2014 there were 2,000 Iranian
claims but in 2006 there were 2,376. In 2010 there were 1,866 but in 2008
there were 2,270.

The appellant relies on the rate of voluntary returns of failed asylum
seekers to Iran. It is pointed out that the government's figures reveal
that there has been a further sharp reduction since 2011 (from an already
relatively low rate). It is suggested that "when considered on Sivakumaran
and Karanakaran principles" the disproportionately high reluctance of
Iran's nationals to return after failing their asylum claims is a
significant part of the factual matrix.

However, we do not consider that we are assisted much, if at all, by the
evidence as to the numbers or proportion of voluntary returns to Iran. On
behalf of the appellant the implication is, presumably, that a low and
decreasing rate of voluntary returns is an indication of risk, or if not
risk, then at least a subjective fear of return.

However, as in the case of the numbers of claims for asylum, we do not
consider that the raw data on voluntary returns has much evidential value
in terms of the issues to be decided in this appeal, either generally in
terms of country guidance or specifically in relation to this appellant.
Whilst we bear in mind the standard of proof in protection claims, one
would need at least some information about the motivations of those not
willing to return voluntarily before reaching any evidential conclusions.
Motivations other than risk or fear could be, for example, economic
considerations. In this respect we note that the Country Policy and
Information note for Iran, version 4.0 dated December 2017 ("CPIN") states
at para 10.1.1 that:

           "Iran faces a difficult economic situation, due to a combination
           of past economic mismanagement and international sanctions. The
           economy has been hit in recent years by high inflation, the high
           cost of Government subsidies, significant currency depreciation
           and an increase in the cost of food and imported goods."

In relation to employment, para 10.2.1 states that officially unemployment
stands at 10% although it is considerably higher in reality, with some
estimates putting unemployment at 20% with informal estimates at 40%. It
goes on to state that substantial unemployment exists, with young people
and women particularly badly hit. At 10.2.2 one finds that:

           "The unemployment rate returned to a three-year high of 12.7
           percent (or 3.3 million unemployed) in the second quarter of
           2016 despite the high growth rate in this period".

Other employment and economic difficulties are referred to in the report.
We do not say that there are not some positive employment and economic
factors and plainly an assessment of the economic and employment
opportunities in Iran is beyond our scope. The point we wish to illustrate
with, admittedly, a necessarily selective reference to that aspect of the
background material, is that it may be that economic factors have a part to
play in relation to any relative lack of voluntary returns.

A related issue and a source of dispute between the parties concerns the
disclosure request made on behalf of the appellant in November 2017. The
request relates to details of Iranian asylum claimants and returnees, in
particular whether the claimants were of Kurdish ethnicity. The
respondent's response dated 17 January 2018, to summarise, refers to the
government website and tables to which we have referred above but in terms
of the number of Iranian nationals of Kurdish ethnicity claiming or granted
asylum each year up to 2017 the respondent said that that information is
not held in a manner that can be extracted by means other than a manual
review of all the cases. It is pointed out that for 2016 alone that would
require a manual review of over 4,000 asylum applications. A similar
response is given in relation to enforced involuntary returns and what
documents they were returned on.

The appellant, if not complains, then at least comments that the respondent
"chooses" (skeleton argument [54]) not to record information about
ethnicity of returnees in an easily accessible way and thus declines to
disclose it. Any notion that the respondent has somehow contrived to
conceal relevant information about the fate of failed asylum seekers of
Kurdish ethnicity is rejected by the respondent; the information simply
cannot be obtained save at disproportionate cost the respondent says.

We do not interpret the appellant's case as suggesting any attempt to
conceal information on the part of the respondent, only the contention that
the information as to ethnicity of those from Iran making asylum claims
(and no doubt returnees) ought to be information provided by the
respondent. We do not consider that this is a matter upon which we should
make comment in terms of what information is collected by the respondent in
relation to asylum claimants and returnees, or in what form. Suffice to say
that there is nothing to indicate any bad faith on the part of the
respondent in this respect and the respondent has explained the reasons for
not providing it.

What it does mean however, is simply that little, if anything, of
evidential value can be deduced from the information as to numbers of
asylum claimants from Iran or returnees. The evidence of claims and returns
before us is, we conclude, merely part of the background to the appeal and
we find that it does not assist us in our assessment of the issues because
we simply do not know enough about the details of those individuals.

    (iv) Conclusions

Although there was some evidence before us in relation to the potential
risk to family members who themselves are at risk or who for some reason
have come to the adverse attention of the authorities in Iran, that was not
the focus of the arguments advanced by the parties and was not addressed in
detail in the expert evidence. We do not therefore give guidance on this
issue but simply note the background evidence, for example in the CIG at
sections 3 and 11, which in part we have quoted above, as well as the
expert evidence.

On behalf of the appellant it is suggested (as set out in written
submissions) that guidance be given to the effect that a risk of
persecution arises where an individual is involved in the making, re-
posting or otherwise publicising critical, insulting satirical etc comments
about Islam, Islamic religious figures, the Qur'an, Iran's policies or
regime members, online on social media networks whether in Iran or abroad.

However, we consider that such proposed guidance is way outside the scope
of the case before us and in any event is far too widely drawn. Although
there was evidence before us regarding the potential risk for those whose
internet activity/social media use may attract the adverse attention of the
authorities, that was not a matter which the parties or experts engaged
with in relation to the giving of country guidance in terms, for example,
of the ability of the Iranian state to monitor such activity. Indeed, in
oral evidence Ms Enayat said that she had not been asked to deal with the
question of social media in her instructions (although she had given
evidence on the issue in AB and Others). We also take the view that such a
consideration is likely to require some technical evidence and such was not
before us. Social media use is however, relevant to this particular
appellant's appeal and we consider it in that context.

Similarly, quite apart from being outside the country guidance issue that
we are concerned with, we do not consider that the evidence before us was
such that we are able to offer guidance in relation to persons who have
evidenced support for a Sunni Salafi group or ideology.

It was also suggested on behalf of the appellant that a circumstance that
will create a reasonable risk of persecution for Iranians of Kurdish
ethnicity includes "[p]revious residence in the Kurdish regions of Iraq".
This is on the basis that although Iran is a major trading partner with the
KRI and has cooperated with it in the fight against ISIS, the KRI contains
a significant population of Kurdish refugees from Iran and the Kurdish
partisan groups all keep bases and training camps there. Thus, it is
suggested that any Iranian Kurd who has resided in the KRI and comes to the
attention of the Iranian authorities is reasonably likely to face
questioning in detention.

In his written submissions Mr Metcalfe accepted the evidence of Ms Enayat
in terms of the appellant being likely to face additional questioning by
reason of having lived in the KRI for so many years, although it was
nevertheless argued that she did not say that he would therefore face a
real risk of ill-treatment or persecution as a result. Ms Enayat said that
the authorities are interested in the backgrounds of Iranians who had
resided for a long time in Iraq and they would want to know where and what
he was doing in Iraq and there would be an investigation. Professor Joff�
gave similar evidence. He said that if the appellant said that he came from
Iraq, the first thing is that it would mean that he had left Iran
illegally.  The second question would be as to why he went to Iraq.  It
would be pre-supposed that he would be connected with the opposition
movements which are all centred in Iraq.

We consider that the expert evidence on this discrete issue, seen in the
context of the background evidence overall, is a sufficient basis from
which to conclude that a period of residence in the KRI by a Kurdish
returnee is reasonably likely to result in additional questioning by the
authorities on return. However, this is a factor that will be highly fact-
specific and the degree of interest that such residence will excite will
depend, non-exhaustively, on matters such as the length of residence in the
KRI, what the person concerned was doing there and why they left.

Above we have referred to SSH and HR. Ultimately, neither party contended
that that decision should no longer be followed in terms of the country
guidance for which it was reported. We have given our reasons for not
accepting Professor Joff�'s evidence in so far as he suggested that SSH and
HR should no longer be followed. It remains valid country guidance.

It is common ground that Kurds in Iran face discrimination. However, the
evidence does not support a contention that that discrimination is at such
a level as to amount to persecution.

On behalf of the respondent objection was taken to some of the evidence of
Professor Joff� and Ms Enayat as to the individual examples of human rights
abuses against Kurds (and non-Kurds) on the basis that they either pre-
dated SSH and HR or were in fact considered in that case. However, the
respondent's position is inconsistent, on the one hand decrying a lack of
recent examples of individual cases of mistreatment of Kurds yet also
stating in submissions that it was accepted that conditions have
deteriorated.

It is common ground that Kurds involved in Kurdish political groups are at
risk of arrest, prolonged detention and physical abuse by the Iranian
authorities. Kurds expressing peaceful dissent or who speak out about
Kurdish rights also face a real risk of persecution.

Those activities that can be perceived to be political include social
welfare and charitable activities on behalf of Kurds. Indeed, involvement
with any organised activity on behalf of or in support of Kurds can be
perceived as political and thus involve a risk of adverse attention by the
Iranian authorities with the consequent risk of persecution. The threshold
for consideration by the Iranian authorities of activities being political
is a low one.

What emerges from the background and expert evidence is an extreme
sensitivity on the part of the Iranian state to activities that are, or are
perceived to be, anti-regime. Ms Enayat's evidence was that even being in
possession of a Kurdish flag  or a leaflet would put someone in trouble
with the authorities. Although there was criticism of her evidence on
behalf of the respondent in that respect (a single leaflet), her evidence
chimes with what appears at para 11.1.2 of the CIG (on Kurds and Kurdish
political groups) in the quotation from a Landinfo report of February 2013:

         "The Landinfo report further noted that; 'if an individual were
         caught with a leaflet, he would most likely be arrested and
         tortured as well as forced to confess to being a member of whatever
         group could have been behind such a publication. He or she would go
         through a five minute trial and the outcome such a trial could vary
         from many years imprisonment to a mild sentence. It is impossible
         to say'."

This example of low level activity having the potential to create a risk of
ill-treatment is nothing new therefore. It can hardly be said that the
human rights situation in Iran in general has improved in recent years and,
as we have seen, recent events have created an environment of greater
suspicion of Kurds and Kurdish activities. In addition, the example of the
mere carrying of a leaflet or Kurdish flag is entirely consistent with the
background material put before us, for example "Even those who express
peaceful dissent or who speak out about Kurdish rights", "there is no
tolerance on the Iranian regime's side for any kind of activities with
connection to the Kurdish political parties and any affiliation with one of
these parties would be reason for arrest".

The evidence before us makes it clear that since 2016 the Iranian
authorities have become increasingly suspicious of and sensitive to Kurdish
political activity. Those of Kurdish ethnicity are thus regarded with even
greater suspicion and are reasonably likely to be subjected to heightened
scrutiny. We accept what Ms Enayat says at [53] of her report, namely that
"it is quite evident that the increased militancy of the Kurdish parties
coupled with the IS attack of July 2017 will mean greatly enhanced
suspicions of any Kurdish returnees". Professor Joff�'s evidence was to
like effect

The evidence also indicates that the Iranian authorities demonstrate what
could be described as a 'hair-trigger' approach to those suspected of or
perceived to be involved in Kurdish political activities or support for
Kurdish rights. By 'hair-trigger' we mean that the threshold for suspicion
is low and the reaction of the authorities is reasonably likely to be
extreme.

It is true, as argued by the respondent, that there is a lack of evidence
of problems from the authorities faced by Kurdish returnees, but that must
be seen in the context of the relatively low numbers of those returning. In
addition, as already explored, nothing is known to us about the ethnicity
of those returned, or indeed of the nature of any asylum claim made.

What is not disputed is that a returnee without a passport is likely to be
questioned on return. Such is the expert evidence before us and such is
recognised in current country guidance, for example, SSH and HR. It is not
within the scope of this decision to revisit existing country guidance in
terms of the procedures for obtaining a laissez-passer or in relation to
questioning on return, notwithstanding that both parties, to a greater or
lesser extent, sought to explore those issues.

    COUNTRY GUIDANCE

Drawing on all the expert and background evidence, and taking into account
the submissions of the parties, we come to the following conclusions:

    (1)  SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran (CG) [2016]
        UKUT 308 (IAC) remains valid country guidance in terms of the
        country guidance offered in the headnote. For the avoidance of
        doubt, that decision is not authority for any proposition in
        relation to the risk on return for refused Kurdish asylum-seekers on
        account of their Kurdish ethnicity alone.

    (2) Kurds in Iran face discrimination. However, the evidence does not
        support a contention that such discrimination is, in general, at
        such a level as to amount to persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.



    (3)  Since 2016 the Iranian authorities have become increasingly
        suspicious of, and sensitive to, Kurdish political activity. Those
        of Kurdish ethnicity are thus regarded with even greater suspicion
        than hitherto and are reasonably likely to be subjected to
        heightened scrutiny on return to Iran.

    (4)  However, the mere fact of being a returnee of Kurdish ethnicity
        with or without a valid passport, and even if combined with illegal
        exit, does not create a risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-
        treatment.

    (5)  Kurdish ethnicity is nevertheless a risk factor which, when
        combined with other factors, may create a real risk of persecution
        or Article 3 ill-treatment. Being a risk factor it means that
        Kurdish ethnicity is a factor of particular significance when
        assessing risk. Those "other factors" will include the matters
        identified in paragraphs (6)-(9) below.

    (6)  A period of residence in the KRI by a Kurdish returnee is
        reasonably likely to result in additional questioning by the
        authorities on return. However, this is a factor that will be highly
        fact-specific and the degree of interest that such residence will
        excite will depend, non-exhaustively, on matters such as the length
        of residence in the KRI, what the person concerned was doing there
        and why they left.

    (7)  Kurds involved in Kurdish political groups or activity are at risk
        of arrest, prolonged detention and physical abuse by the Iranian
        authorities. Even Kurds expressing peaceful dissent or who speak out
        about Kurdish rights also face a real risk of persecution or Article
        3 ill-treatment.

    (8)  Activities that can be perceived to be political by the Iranian
        authorities include social welfare and charitable activities on
        behalf of Kurds. Indeed, involvement with any organised activity on
        behalf of or in support of Kurds can be perceived as political and
        thus involve a risk of adverse attention by the Iranian authorities
        with the consequent risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.

    (9)  Even 'low-level' political activity, or activity that is perceived
        to be political, such as, by way of example only, mere possession of
        leaflets espousing or supporting Kurdish rights, if discovered,
        involves the same risk of persecution or Article 3 ill-treatment.
        Each case however, depends on its own facts and an assessment will
        need to be made as to the nature of the material possessed and how
        it would be likely to be viewed by the Iranian authorities in the
        context of the foregoing guidance.

   (10)  The Iranian authorities demonstrate what could be described as a
        'hair-trigger' approach to those suspected of or perceived to be
        involved in Kurdish political activities or support for Kurdish
        rights. By 'hair-trigger' it means that the threshold for suspicion
        is low and the reaction of the authorities is reasonably likely to
        be extreme.

         THIS APPELLANT-ASSESSMENT AND CONCLUSIONS

In applying the above guidance and existing country guidance to the facts
of this appellant's appeal, we remind ourselves of the statement of agreed
facts which we have set out in full at [4]. Judge Storey referred to the
FtJ having found that the core of the appellant's account was credible. We
think however, that we ought to make further reference to the specific
credibility findings made by the FtJ.

At [13] the FtJ found that the appellant had at all times been consistent
in his account. In that same paragraph he considered the respondent's
challenges to the appellant's account of his parents' support for the
Peshmerga. In that context the FtJ said the following:

           "The Respondent accepted his claim to be of Iranian nationality
           but felt that there were challenges to credibility because of
           his lack of knowledge of his parents' activities. It was felt
           that it was not credible, for instance, that the Appellant had
           not known about his parents' support for peshmergas prior to his
           return to Iran in 2015. It was not thought that it was credible
           that the Appellant's uncle would not know of their actions. It
           is unclear to me how the Respondent reached those conclusions
           when the uncle was not available to clarify what he did or did
           not know and the Appellant was only six years of age when he was
           moved from Iran into Iraq. It is difficult to see why the
           Appellant and his uncle should have looked for opportunities to
           discuss his parents' activities in detail. The Appellant did say
           in his asylum interview that his parents had provided support
           for peshmergas in matters such as food (asylum interview record
           question 39)."

At [14], in relation to the disappearance of the appellant's parents the
FtJ said this:

           "The Appellant in his testimony accepted that he did not know
           what had happened to his parents, simply that they had been
           taken away and he had not heard of them since. Again, as he was
           only six years of age, his level of personal knowledge and
           understanding will be extremely limited."

To complete the picture, at [15] the FtJ said that he did not accept the
appellant's evidence "about the reasons why his parents disappeared"
because he had no personal knowledge of the details and the information
given by his uncle was very vague. At [17] he found that the evidence did
not show any real likelihood that the appellant would be regarded as a
person of adverse interest  "because of his parents' activities now more
than 23 years ago".

It is at least implicit from the FtJ's decision that he found that the
appellant's parents had been politically active in terms of providing
support for Kurdish political groups referred to as "pro-Kurdish separatist
groups" in the statement of agreed facts.

Finally, it is important to note that the FtJ said at [17] that he accepted
the appellant's evidence "that he has never had any involvement in
political activities even though he is, broadly, a supporter of Kurdish
rights".

In the light of the FtJ's acceptance of the appellant's account of his
parents having been involved in providing support for pro-Kurdish groups,
even if limited to providing support for the Peshmerga in terms of food, we
consider that the disagreement between the parties in relation to how it
came to be that the appellant's family home was destroyed/burnt down in
1994 to be a rather sterile debate. The respondent suggests that this may
have been the work of a Kurdish group but Ms Enayat emphatically rejected
that suggestion. Put simply, she said that such activity was redolent of
the methods of the Iranian security forces at that time and not of Kurdish
groups.

It is a preserved finding that the appellant's parents did disappear, i.e.
were "taken away" in 1994. It is also a finding that they provided support
for pro-Kurdish groups. In relation to Ms Enayat's evidence as to the
destruction of the family home, we consider that it does not 'close the
gap', as it were, in terms of the evidence that was before the FtJ in
relation to why the house was destroyed or why his parents disappeared. If
the only two possibilities for the cause of the destruction of the
appellant's home were actions by the Iranian security forces or a Kurdish
group we would choose the former. But that is not a sufficient basis from
which to conclude that it was the result of activity by Iranian security
forces. Likewise, we do not consider that there is a sufficient evidential
basis from which to conclude that Iranian security forces caused his
parents to 'disappear'.

In the context of the findings that are preserved and in the light of what
we say below about the other aspects of the appellant's claim, we do not
consider that the evidential gap in those respects is significant to our
determination of his appeal.

We next consider the appellant's social media profile. There is additional
evidence before us in that respect that was not before the FtJ. We
permitted further evidence on that issue to be adduced (see [9]-[17]
above).

We repeat what we said at [9] above. The copy documents are contained in a
bundle of 59 pages.  They are posts under the appellant's name and are
accompanied by translations of posts between 24 December 2016 and 16
January 2017.  The date range for the posts is 24 December 2016 to 16
January 2017 (pre-FtT hearing) and 23 February 2017 to 23 October 2017
(post-FtT hearing), the latter not being accompanied by translations.

We have not been provided with an agreed summary of the content of the
Facebook posts but there are translations of a portion of them. For reasons
which will become apparent, not every post needs a translation. We refer to
only a sample of the translations.

In general, as revealed in the posts that have been translated, they
express support for the Kurdish political cause and express opposition to
the Iranian regime. They consist of shared posts from individuals and from,
for example, the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI) Scotland and
one from Denmark (but the latter was not able to be translated).

The following is a sample of the posts (in the order in which they appear
in the bundle):

        . A shared post of a video, dated 16 January 2017, says "If you
          consider yourself a Kurd please shared it (sic) to be watched by
          as many people as possible". What is on the video is not stated.

        . A shared "Democratic Rebels' video dated 16 January 2017 says
          "The Peshmerga of Kurdistan Democratic Party destroyed the
          Iranian forces ambush in Sardasht".

        . A shared post, dated 15 January 2017, from the PDKI (Scotland),
          with a photograph, refers to the 71st anniversary of the
          establishment of "Kurdistan Republic of Mahabad" going on to
          refer to the Republic of Kurdistan as the first Kurdish national
          state.

        . A shared post, dated 11 January 2017 refers to the burial
          ceremony of "the martyrs of the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK)".

        . A shared PDKI (Scotland) post, dated 10 January 2017 refers to
          the death of Ali Akbar Rafsanjani [former President of Iran] and
          includes the words "The father of terrorists has died" with his
          photograph and a cross through it.

        . Another shared post from the PDKI (Scotland), dated 4 January
          2017 says "The Iranian regime of execution is the biggest
          terrorists in the world".

        . A similar shared post, dated 4 January 2017 says "Happy Kurdistan
          Flag Day and Peshmerga's Day".

        . A shared post from an individual dated 27 December 2016 has,
          amongst others, the words "Down with the Islamic Republic of
          Iran" and "We must struggle to end the oppression" accompanied by
          a photograph of Ayatollah Khomeini with superimposed images of
          men hung by the neck on ropes.

        . A photograph in a shared post, dated 8 January 2017, depicts
          Ayatollah Khomeini on all fours being kicked from behind by a
          woman.

        . A photograph in a shared post dated February 2017 (and 1 March
          2017) depicts Ayatollah Khomeini with an altered facial
          impression. The photograph is not clear enough in the photocopy
          to be more specific. In the same shared post Ayatollah Khomeini
          has a toilet pan superimposed over his body.

        . A photograph in a (possibly original) post, with no discernible
          date, superimposes Ayatollah Khomeini's face over the body of a
          dog on a lead.

        . A photograph in a (possibly original) post, dated June 2017 shows
          Ayatollah Khomeini's face with male genitalia superimposed over
          his nose.

Mr Metcalfe submitted that there is insufficient evidence that the Iranian
authorities would necessarily be aware of that material and that the
evidence did not establish that the Iranian authorities routinely inspect
the internet profiles of failed asylum seekers.

However, we noted at [97] above that it is not disputed that a returnee
without a passport is likely to be questioned on return, confirmed in the
expert evidence before us and recognised in existing current country
guidance, for example, SSH and HR. Ms Enayat's evidence was that it is part
of the routine process to look at an internet profile, Facebook and emails
of a returnee.  A person would be asked whether they had a Facebook page
and that would be checked. When the person returns they will be asked to
log onto their Facebook and email accounts.  That is also the effect of her
evidence given in AB and Others which was accepted by the Tribunal in that
case (see [457]).

Mr Metcalfe accepted that the material posted by the appellant on Facebook,
if it became known to the authorities, would expose him to prosecution with
a risk of imprisonment and that this would result in a real risk of ill-
treatment. It was also accepted that the appellant's Facebook page is
currently visible to the public at large.

We are satisfied that the content of the appellant's Facebook page would
become known to the authorities on return as part of the process of
investigation of his background. That is the effect of the expert and
background evidence before us. It is then, no step at all to the conclusion
that this would involve a real risk of persecution and Article 3 ill-
treatment in his case, by reason of detention and ill-treatment and likely
prosecution. His Facebook posts would reveal not only his support for
Kurdish rights but also his having insulted the Iranian regime and leading
figures in it. This is reasonably likely to be regarded not only as having
'crossed the line' in terms of political views or activity, but also in
terms of religious dissent.

There are in fact a cluster of factors that would lead to significant
adverse reaction to this appellant by the Iranian authorities, quite apart
from the Facebook material which would be sufficient on its own. That
material in its political content of support for Kurdish rights would
dovetail in the minds of those questioning the appellant with what he is
reasonably likely to reveal under questioning about his parents' support
for Kurdish groups, albeit many years ago and his own broad support for
Kurdish rights. Likewise the fact of the appellant having lived in the KRI
for many years.

In terms of what the appellant would be expected to reveal under
questioning, Mr Metcalfe relied on an unreported decision of the UT in
Secretary of State for the Home Department v MH (PA/02219/2017), 7 December
2017, where at [41] it was said that what an individual would say, if
questioned, "is a factual finding which must be made on the basis of all
the evidence". That decision is relied on in support of the proposition
that there was no evidence from this appellant to show that he would
disclose his political opinions and the FtT did not find a risk in that
respect.

Ms Naik raised a number of objections to this aspect of the respondent's
case as can be seen from our summary of the parties' submissions. It is
sufficient for us to state that we do not consider that the respondent is
entitled to rely on that unreported decision in circumstances where the
Senior President's Practice Directions at paragraph 11 in relation to the
citation of unreported decisions has not been complied with. For our
purposes the decision in RT (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home
Department [2012] UKSC 38 requires no clarification.

In any event, the resolution of this appellant's appeal does not depend on
what he would say if asked about his political opinions when questioned,
given what would in any event be discovered. If we had to answer the
question as to what he would say, we would simply conclude that, following
RT (Zimbabwe) the appellant could not be expected to lie about his
political belief of support for Kurdish rights, about which he is
reasonably likely to be directly questioned given his particular
circumstances.

In the light of our assessment of what is reasonably likely to befall the
appellant when questioned on return, we are satisfied that he has
established to the required lower standard that he has a well-founded fear
of persecution for a Convention reason, namely his actual and imputed
political opinion. Thus we allow his appeal on asylum grounds and under
Article 3 of the ECHR.

    Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error on
a point of law. Its decision having been set aside, we re-make the decision
by allowing the appeal on asylum and human rights grounds with reference to
Article 3 of the ECHR.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Representation:

                    ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Iran.  On  1  February  2017  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge (FtTJ) Nicholls dismissed his appeal.  The judge did  so
    despite finding that the appellant had given at core  credible  account
    of his experiences in Iran (and  Iraq).   At  paragraph  17  the  judge
    stated:

         "17. Although I accept the Appellant's evidence of  the  course  of
             his claim, I find that that evidence does not  show  any  real
             likelihood that this Appellant would be regarded as  a  person
             of adverse interest either because of his parents'  activities
             now  more  than  23  years  ago  or  because  of  any  of  the
             Appellant's own actions more recently.  I accept his  evidence
             that he has never had any involvement in political  activities
             even though he is, broadly, a supporter of Kurdish rights.   I
             find that if he is returned to Iran the Appellant would simply
             be identified as a person who left the country illegally  and,
             probably, was a failed asylum seeker.   The  key  question  in
             this appeal is whether those two  factors  by  themselves  are
             sufficient to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution."


2.   The judge then addressed the appellant's attempt to rely on two  expert
    reports from Professor Joff�:


         "18. The Appellant  has  submitted  the  two  expert  reports  from
             Professor Joff�, in the second of which  the  professor  takes
             issue with the conclusions of the Upper Tribunal  in  SSH  and
             HR, arguing that they reached the wrong conclusion  about  the
             risks faced by failed asylum seekers,  particularly  those  of
             Kurdish ethnicity.   In  his  skeleton  argument  and  closing
             submissions counsel for the  Appellant  argued  that  the  two
             conclusions reached in SSH and HR did not  go  so  far  as  to
             assess the position of Kurdish failed asylum seekers and  that
             it was open to me to reach conclusions on  the  basis  of  the
             evidence  without  needing  to  find  grounds  to  reject  the
             conclusions in the country guidance case.   I  do  not  accept
             that submission."


3.   The judge went on to find that the two  appellants  considered  in  SSH
    and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016]  UKUT  00308
    (IAC) were in the same position as the appellant and observed  that  at
    paragraph 34 of SSH the UT had concluded that "the  evidence  does  not
    show risk of ill-treatment to such returnees, though we accept it might
    be an exacerbating factor for a returnee otherwise  of  interest".   At
    paragraphs 20 and 21 the judge concluded:

         "20. I have carefully read both of Professor Joff�'s reports and  I
             note his disagreements both with the  conclusions  reached  by
             the Upper Tribunal and his evidence that the position of Kurds
             in Iran has deteriorated since the evidence in  that  decision
             was heard.  However, I am required to follow country  guidance
             cases unless there is clear evidence that the conclusions  are
             out of date.  Many of the factors mentioned by Professor Joff�
             are discussed in SSH  and  HR,  such  as  the  procedures  for
             obtaining a laisser-passer and the views of a retired  Iranian
             judge.   I  am  not  satisfied,  therefore,  that   there   is
             sufficient new evidence which was not considered by the  Upper
             Tribunal which requires me to depart from the country guidance
             case.


         21.  I find that this Appellant has shown that  he  is  of  Kurdish
             ethnicity, that he illegally exited Iran  and  that  he  would
             return as a failed  asylum  seeker.   I  find  that  he  falls
             squarely within the facts of those considered in  SSH  and  HR
             and that he  has  not  shown  that  there  are  any  extra  or
             additional risk factors which would identify him as  a  person
             of adverse interest to the Iranian authorities.  I  find  that
             the Appellant has  not  established  a  well-founded  fear  of
             persecution and has not shown an entitlement to protection  in
             the UK."


4.   The  appellant's  principal  grounds  of  appeal  as  amplified  by  Mr
    Spurling  before  me  were  that  the  judge  failed  to  provide   any
    satisfactory reasons why he  found  at  paragraph  20  that  there  was
    insufficient new evidence that was not considered in SSH.  The  grounds
    highlighted that Professor Joff�'s reports concluded that "being both a
    Kurd and  a  failed  asylum  seeker  does  imply  significant  risk  of
    persecution" and that the Tribunal in SSH had not dealt  properly  with
    the difficulties facing persons leaving Iran illegally of  obtaining  a
    laissez-passer document.

5.   I am grateful to both representatives for their helpful submissions.

6.   I am persuaded that the FtTJ materially erred  in  law.   It  is  clear
    from the judge's reasoning that he considered that the appellant  could
    not succeed because the issue of whether he was at risk (because of his
    Kurdish ethnicity combined with his being someone  who  left  illegally
    and would be perceived as a failed asylum seeker) had been ruled on  by
    the UT in the country guidance case of SSH.  However, whilst it is true
    that the UT in SSH did  reach  conclusions  on  the  issue  of  Kurdish
    ethnicity as a risk factor, that issue was not one  of  the  identified
    country guidance issues in the case and as such fell outside the  scope
    of Practice Direction 12.2.  It cannot be excluded that had  the  judge
    correctly directed himself regarding the scope of the country  guidance
    in SSH he would have come to a different conclusion.

7.   By the same token, the judge cannot be criticised for  relying  on  the
    findings reached by the UT in SSH on the laissez-passer  issue  because
    that was an issue specifically identified by the UT in that case  as  a
    country guidance issue: see paragraph 33(a).

8.   For the above reasons I conclude that the FtTJ materially erred in  law
    and his decision is set aside.

9.   I discussed with the parties how they thought I should dispose  of  the
    appeal on the hypothesis that I did set aside the decision of the  FtT.
    I also raised with them the matter of whether the case was  potentially
    suitable for listing together with other cases in the context of a  new
    country guidance on Iran.  Mr Spurling  said  that  the  appellant  was
    publicly funded and confirmed immediately after the  hearing  that  the
    appellant and his instructing solicitors would have no objection to the
    appellant's case being joined with other cases being case managed for a
    new country guidance hearing.  Mr Bramble said it was a matter for  the
    UT but if I  decided  to  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  FtTJ  the
    appellant's case might be a suitable one to be  added  to  the  country
    guidance proceedings.

10.  I have concluded that I am not in a position to  re-make  the  decision
    in this case as it requires  a  further  hearing.   Both  parties  have
    indicated that they consider that the FtTJ's primary  finding  of  fact
    about the  appellant's  adverse  experience  should  be  preserved.   I
    concur.  The case is one that can best be dealt with by being  retained
    in the UT.

11.  Bearing in mind the above, the appellant's case will be set down for  a
    further hearing.  Whether or not it will be  joined  with  other  cases
    being case managed for a new country guidance case will be a matter for
    the Upper Tribunal to decide.  If it does so decide, it would be with a
    view to  the  issue  of  Kurdish  ethnicity  as  a  risk  factor  being
    identified as one of the  specific  country  guidance  issues.  If  the
    parties receive listing of the appeal without any reference to  country
    guidance they can assume the  matter  of  it  being  added  to  country
    guidance was considered but rejected by the Upper Tribunal.

12.  For the above reasons:

    The FtTJ materially erred in law and his decision is set aside.


    The case is to be listed for a further hearing in the Upper Tribunal.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Dr H H Storey
Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                     ANNEX B

                            EXPERT (ORAL) EVIDENCE

    Anna Enayat

    1.   In examination-in-chief Ms Enayat said that the fact that the
         appellant comes from Betoosh on the Iran/Iraq border is not
         something in particular that adds to the issue of risk, either in
         terms of it being a route used by the Kurdish Democratic Party of
         Iran ("KDPI") or in terms of the fact that the appellant comes from
         that area.  The issues are the same for all Kurds from western
         provinces.

    2.   As she said in her report, the Western provinces are the epicentre
         of Kurdish political activity and Kurds residing there face far
         greater risks of running foul of the security apparatus than Kurds
         elsewhere. There are more situations in which Kurds would have
         imputed to them a belief that they were doing something wrong, but
         going about their day-to-day business there would not be such
         greater risks.  Particular situations of heightened scrutiny for
         Kurds would be if they were to go and live in Iraq or pass through
         the airport having failed in an asylum claim or being on the
         streets when demonstrations were going on.

    3.   They could come to the attention of the authorities for a non-
         political reason such as being involved in various charitable
         activities.  The risk is then that they might be perceived as being
         anti-government.  This is because the government has always sought
         to eliminate any organised activity.  This was less so in 2000 but
         increased between 2005 and 2006.  It was particularly in Kurdish
         areas where there was a widespread suppression of NGO's, for
         example environmentalists.  Kurds would be at greater risk in this
         respect.  Typically they would be arrested for national security
         crimes.  It is clear that the government thinks that any civic
         organisation is a cover for political activity.  It is the
         organised nature of it, rather than the activity itself.

    4.   That started to emerge in relation to non-political organisations
         in about 2007 or 2008.  That was the build up to the start of the
         presidency of President Ahmadinejad. Those who were not Kurdish
         were also at risk but the risk was much more evident in Kurdish
         areas and became noticeable in 2007-2008.  There are less instances
         now because people do not make NGO's anymore.  There are now very
         few NGO's in Kurdish areas, but also overall.  From 2006 to 2008
         and to now, it has made it virtually impossible to register an NGO.
          Persecution in relation to NGO's was intense in Kurdish areas but
         also happened elsewhere. She referred to examples given in her
         response to written questions.

    5.   As to whether the situation is now more sensitive than in 2016,
         she said that a series of events had affected the whole political
         context in terms of Iran and Kurdistan.  First, there was the
         fighting in the Syrian war which has raised national consciousness
         amongst Kurds.   Second, there was the resumption in 2016 of armed
         activities by Kurdish national parties who had repudiated violence
         and which were an offshoot of the PKK; the first major resurgence
         since the 1990's.  Third, Kurds in the abortive independence
         referendum in the KRI mobilised the population in Kurdish cities of
         Iran.  Fourth, was the terrorist attack on the Iranian parliament
         in Tehran in July 2017 where the perpetrators were Islamist Kurds.
         The Iranian security services rounded up Kurds in the Kurdish
         areas.  There was therefore heightened security activity.  They
         were worried about terrorist attacks.

    6.   In relation to someone who confines their activity to the internet
         or leafleting who could be described as a low level activist, that
         would lead to arrest if it took place on Iranian territory.  If a
         Kurd was returning from abroad it would lead to increased
         vigilance.

    7.   In relation to the appellant, in terms of sharing anti-regime
         posts and making fun of senior government or religious figures, if
         the appellant was caught and identified he would be punished by
         being put in prison.  Before that he would probably be tortured in
         pre-trial detention.  Procedures used to identify persons in those
         circumstances who would be returning as a refugee, would involve
         interrogation and background checks.  Secondary checks would be as
         described in her report.  That would be pretty much routine if a
         person went back on a temporary document or was deported. There
         would be questioning at the airport by security officials.

    8.   If the person was identified as being of interest in relation to
         email or internet activity, it is very likely that the person would
         be prosecuted as opposed to just being detained and ill-treated.
         The state has an interest in making examples of such people.  She
         referred to the examples in her report (appendix IV). The formal
         accusation would usually be insulting Islam, or the supreme leader,
         or spreading lies and propaganda against the system.

    9.   As to the suggestion made by the respondent that it would be
         different if a person was found to be posting in an opportunistic
         manner or in fun, or to bolster an asylum claim, Ms Enayat said
         that the reaction of the authorities can be seen in particular
         cases, for example one 'SB' sometime in 2011-2012 who had a joke
         website or Facebook page.  The punishment was something like 15 or
         16 years' imprisonment.  He was beaten in custody.  She does not
         have the information with her because she had not been prepared for
         questions on that issue.

    10.  Even in relation to someone who could be said to have made up
         stories to make their asylum case better, the point is that the
         authorities would regard it as besmirching their name and accusing
         them of human rights violations.  If someone were to say that they
         had pretended to convert but had not really, that would be okay.
         If it was a genuine conversion they would probably pressure you to
         recant.  But if one was making up a political statement it is not
         so easy to say that that was all 'rubbish'.  When pressed on the
         matter Ms Enayat responded to state that she felt she was being
         asked questions that she could not answer.

    11.  As to whether the fact that a person was Kurdish would add to the
         seriousness of their situation, she said that one does not
         necessarily have to be Kurdish to be punished for anti-government
         jokes.  The more important point about Kurdish refugees is the
         likely greater degree of scrutiny.  She said that she was not
         saying that in the vast majority of cases there would be a risk in
         applying for asylum but a person would be questioned about it.  One
         would have to sign a piece of paper saying that they regretted
         their claim.  If one were to have something like the Facebook page
         as in this case, that would be very likely to come to light at the
         airport.  It is part of the routine process to look at an internet
         profile, Facebook and emails.  A person would be asked whether they
         had a Facebook page and they would check.  The checks at the
         airport apply to everybody.

    12.  As to whether there would be a greater risk for Kurds, she did not
         think that spot checks for Kurds occurred but if a person was going
         back and had applied for asylum in the West, they would be checked.
         If there was proper documentation they would not do so although she
         did not know. Her understanding was that everybody returned on a
         temporary document would be questioned.  It would be routine for an
         internet profile to be examined.

    13.  In relation to Kurds, the security people would go on to ask which
         Kurdish groups or organisations the person was involved in.  It
         would be followed through much more.

    14.  Unless they said something against the state which was
         identifiable, there would be no other problems.  If a person had
         made an asylum claim but had no internet profile although had said
         something against the state, if there was no other reason (of
         interest), the security forces would not bother them, just because
         they had made an asylum claim.  However with Kurds, they always do
         have something else to bother about because they want to find out
         if they have organisational connections.  From what she
         understands, they monitor Kurdish returnees.  They would say "off
         you go" and then call them back, although she does not know
         exactly. She does know that they have a monitoring system.

    15.  As to whether there was a risk of ill-treatment in that process,
         she said that there was always a risk of ill-treatment for that
         category but she could not predict it or put numbers on it.  As to
         whether in the current context, post 2016, it was reasonably likely
         that there would be ill-treatment in those circumstances, she said
         that the risks were increased.  Any case of pre-trial detention
         involves a risk of being beaten up or psychologically tortured.
         Individual cases are very difficult to predict. It was impossible
         to say that there would not be a risk.

    16.  A Kurdish returnee who had made an asylum claim but who had no
         internet activity who is monitored, would not be at risk.  The
         initial interview is where there would be the risk if the interview
         goes on and they go "beyond the office" as it were, into detention.
          If a person is recalled, there would not be a risk unless the
         detention becomes lengthy.  She could not say that there was a risk
         because there is not enough information about returnees.  She does
         not know whether there would be a risk in the context of people
         recalled for questioning.

    17.  Questioning would not always take place at the airport.  She has
         only anecdotal evidence in relation to the questioning.  A security
         person would ask where they were going to be.  The person they
         recall is then summonsed.  She knows of at least two cases where
         the people have been beaten up but she does not know what
         documentation the returnees had.  The only inference that she draws
         is that there are no patterns. The questioning at the airport can
         be for hours or days.  She referred to her report and the response
         to questions.

    18.  As to what she refers to at [34] of her report in terms of
         "securitization" of Kurdish provinces by the Iranian government
         since the mid 2000's, more and more troops have been garrisoned in
         Kurdish areas over the last decade.  The procedure at the airport
         is in the hands of the intelligence side of the state.  The head of
         the judiciary is chosen by the Supreme Leader and the Minister of
         Justice is an administrative post.  The Revolutionary Courts are
         under the head of the judiciary which then goes back to the supreme
         leader who has a state within a state, as it were.

    19.  Referred to the Facebook posts in this appeal, Ms Enayat said that
         if the material was accessed by the security forces on return it
         would be explosive.  She said she did not know whether there were
         any circumstances in which that material would not cause a risk to
         the appellant.  The material would put him at risk of a very sound
         beating and they would definitely take him into court, followed by
         prosecution and imprisonment.  She did not think it would make any
         difference if a person had been found to be not credible in his
         asylum claim or said that the material had been put there simply to
         make up a claim.  Ms Enayat referred to an example in her report
         (page 73) in relation to a German-Iranian arrested in 2011 when
         visiting her family in Iran and imprisoned for Facebook posts,
         having been charged with anti-government propaganda and insulting
         the Supreme Leader, and released in 2015 (after being given a three
         year sentence). She said that she had other examples but had not
         previously been asked about it.

    20.  In cross-examination she said that she does not claim to be an
         expert in relation to Kurds or the Kurdish situation in particular.
          When she was in Iran she did visit the Kurdish areas.  She had not
         been to the particular region relevant to the appellant's case.
         She does not speak Sorani.

    21.  Referred to her report at [4], she said that there were lots of
         sources for what she says about punitive measures taken against the
         Kurdish community in the 1990's (in terms of the demolition of
         houses or whole villages).  She referred to footnotes on page 5 of
         her report as to the source of her information in that respect.
         She could not think of other reasons for the appellant's family
         house being burnt down.  The Revolutionary Guard would do such a
         thing but Kurdish groups were not in the conflict at that point and
         she is not aware of Kurdish groups being responsible for the
         demolition of houses.  She said that when she had been asked to
         respond to written questions she revisited the material in relation
         to the appellant's area. There was now evidence (referred to in her
         answers) that in 1984 when the Revolutionary Guard attended the
         area, Betoosh (the appellant's area) was the HQ of the KDPI.

    22.  In relation to Dr Jalaeipour's article (about Kurdish forces in
         the area) referred to at page 4 of her report, he used to be a
         member of the Revolutionary Guard and a leading political scientist
         in Iran.  She had given more detail at page 3 of her response to
         questions. As to whether the article was reliable in terms of the
         methods of the Revolutionary Guard, she said that it was not about
         the Revolutionary Guard but about partisans.  The article that she
         had quoted about the Revolutionary Guard operation in the Sardasht
         area in 1984 explicitly describes going into Betoosh and
         neighbouring villages and clearing them out.

    23.  It was true that one does not know the reason for the appellant's
         parents' house being burnt down but we know what is a reasonable
         likelihood.  She could not think of any other reason as to why the
         house was burnt down and his parents taken away.  It could not be
         retaliation by other Kurdish groups because there were none there
         at the time.  As to whether the appellant's parents might have been
         punished for refusing to help a Kurdish group, she said that she
         had never heard that Kurdish groups terrorised villagers.  They
         need to keep good relations with the villagers.  She could not
         answer in terms of whether the Revolutionary Guard had another
         reason for doing such a thing.

    24.  In relation to the "careful scrutiny" of the local population of
         the Kurdish borderland provinces by the government that she had
         referred to in her report at [16] and [17], that was to watch to
         make sure there were no signs of political activity and to identify
         threats.

    25.  She presumes that it would be right that that would not work if
         the state could not distinguish between genuine and non-genuine
         threats.  Asked about whether that was something that was relevant
         to a person's return to Iran, she said that they would not know the
         background of a person and there was a huge amount of corruption.
         She gave an example of the activities of a particular unit of the
         Revolutionary Guard which had been murdering young Kurdish men and
         dressing them up as Peshmerga to collect the bounty.  She gave a
         further example of three American hikers being arrested by the same
         unit.  The purpose of the security operation may be to identify
         genuine threats but what was the purpose in arresting three
         American hikers?  It was a scandal in Iran for the Kurdish people
         in the area because their children were disappearing.

    26.  In relation to [18] of her report, the case of DH (granted asylum
         in Finland in 2011, returned on a visit to Iran in 2017 and
         arrested and died) was not a situation where she was saying that he
         came to the attention of the authorities purely because of his
         Kurdish ethnicity.  What she was saying was that they could get
         arrested anywhere.

    27.  As to what she says in her report about NGOs ([19]), she could not
         say categorically that there were no NGOs operating.  She did not
         say that she disagreed with paragraphs 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 of the COI
         [CIG] report for Iran (version 2.0 July 2016) but only expands on
         it.  In relation to the example of SG (who died in custody) who had
         previously been in prison for five years and released after the
         authorities realised the error, and whether that showed that the
         authorities were concerned to distinguish between those who were a
         genuine threat and those who were not, she said that sometimes one
         gets an honourable and principled individual.

    28.  She said that she was not arguing that a Kurd, who was not
         perceived in some way to be politically active, would be arrested.
         She could not say anything further about the word "perceived" used
         at [21] of her report in relation to those Kurds perceived to have
         been in contact with Kurdish parties being at risk of arrest and
         harsh treatment, because she does not know enough about the various
         cases.

    29.  The example at [22] of her report is of a low level activist
         Ebrahim Lotfollahi ("EL") (said to have been in possession of
         Kurdish leaflets) but an extreme example of ill-treatment (detained
         and then said by the authorities to have committed suicide while in
         prison, with an autopsy denied and his grave covered over with
         concrete). PJAK (Party of Free Life for Kurdistan) is an armed
         group but she was separating that from (mere) possession of a
         leaflet (about the PJAK).  EL only had one leaflet, which is what
         every source that she had read says and every source that she had
         read said that he was not an activist. Possession of leaflets is
         regarded as a crime. She accepted that there was no translation of
         the article which referred to this example.  At around the same
         time a 19 year old smuggler of alcohol was beaten to death in jail
         in Kurdistan

    30.  As to whether her report was unclear in terms of that individual
         not distributing or having had in his possession a number of
         leaflets, she said that there was very little more that she could
         say.  In answer to further questions in relation to other examples,
         she said that she had never argued that someone who was not
         involved in political activity would be persecuted.  The difference
         between them seemed to be in terms of what was regarded as
         political activity.

    31.  In answer to our questions, she said that those perceived to be
         political activists were at risk and even someone in possession of
         a leaflet would be at risk.

    32.  As to the examples she gives at [23] of her report, those were
         examples of political activists. She had repeatedly said in her
         report that targeting was not purely on the basis of Kurdish
         ethnicity.  The risk involves people identified as being in
         possession of dissenting attitudes.  That is how low the threshold
         goes.  She agreed that if a person was Kurdish and politically
         active the situation would be worse for them than someone who is
         non-Kurdish and politically active.  That was what the evidence
         indicated.  The treatment is harsher.  She added that even
         possession of a Kurdish flag would put such person in trouble with
         the authorities.

    33.  In relation to the Danish Fact-Finding Mission of 2009 at page 11
         and the reference to people affiliated with a person who has some
         "controversy" with the authorities being on a 'list' of those
         affiliated, a person related to another person who is on such a
         'list' can become susceptible to harassment and interrogation.

    34.  In relation to the appellant's maternal uncle who remained in
         Iran, if the appellant's parents were people of interest at the
         time his uncle probably was also on a list and was probably
         harassed.  That was probably why the appellant was sent away.  It
         may be that the uncle stayed in order to protect the property.
         Given that one was now talking about the 1990s, she does not know
         if the situation was the same at the time.  Today the uncle might
         be on a list.  He would not be at risk unless something happened to
         bring him into contact with the authorities.  According to the
         appellant's account, his uncle is not politically active and so he
         would not be at risk.  His uncle is super cautious.  The
         significance of being on a list, according to the Kurdish Human
         Rights Project, is that the list is used to intimidate people.

    35.  The authorities would more be vigilant of the background of a
         refugee.  She was not able to judge how likely it would be that
         someone who is not politically active would be questioned under
         duress, as she is not present at the interrogations.  As she said
         in her report, one does not know how many Kurds have gone back
         because the figures are very, very sparse.  Therefore, she does not
         know how many have been subject to enhanced questioning.  However,
         she does know the way that things work.  Iran is a security state
         and the position in the predominantly Kurdish provinces of the west
         is strategically important for the state.  The situation has
         seriously deteriorated in the last few years. There is constant
         surveillance of the population.  They would be careful about people
         coming back. Again, in answer to our questions she said that there
         are checks done at the embassy in the UK and the embassy would
         report back.

    36.  She agreed that the state would be concerned with identifying
         genuine threats, but she did not know how much investigation that
         would take.  Also, that does not mean to say that if a person is
         not active it would only take five minutes for that to be
         understood.

    37.  She did not agree that it was generally highly unusual for a Kurd
         to join IS.  There had been quite a lot who had joined.  There is a
         Salafist Islamist movement in the KRI and Iran.  It was true
         however, that there was very strong hostility between Kurdish
         groups and IS.  The Iranian government was not surprised that there
         were Kurdish people involved (in the attack on parliament) but
         surprised that they managed to get through.  It was the population
         itself that was surprised that Kurds were involved.  In many ways
         the authorities turned a blind eye to Kurdish involvement with IS
         as it undermined the separatist parties.  There is a larger
         movement of Salafist Islamists which thrives in the border areas
         and which is a fund of personnel and recruitment.  Ansar al-Islam
         is the most important part of the Salafist Movement.

    38.  As to whether there would be questioning at Tehran Airport of a
         returned Kurdish asylum seeker as to involvement with IS in the
         context of the security forces not expecting large numbers of
         Kurdish asylum seekers to be members of IS, she said that she could
         not answer that question and put herself in the mind of the
         security forces.

    39.  In relation to emergency travel documents ("ETD's") (issued
         abroad), a person always used to be asked background questions but
         that does not mean that they would not also be asked at Tehran
         Airport.  However, she does not know of the set up now.
         Applications for ETD's are filtered through security.  Information
         is passed to the authorities in Tehran even if a person is not
         questioned by intelligence or security officers.  If the system is
         the same now as in 2009 we know that anybody with an ETD is
         scrutinised.

    40.  She agreed that she had not been asked to deal with the question
         of social media in her instructions.  However, she did provide a
         report in AB and Others and gave evidence.  There is also quite a
         good COI (Country of Origin Information) report on that issue and
         she thinks there are more recent Canadian reports but she does not
         have the references.

    41.  She does not know about what questioning there would be about
         social media at the embassy when someone is trying to obtain a
         laissez-passer, but they would be questioned in Iran.  She does not
         know whether Facebook or Twitter would be checked in a person's
         presence at the embassy.  There would be a check of a person's
         internet profile and a name would be run through Google.  In
         relation to the appellant's name, it is true that some names are
         similar but she questioned whether there would be 10 HB's returning
         at the same time.  Iran has a huge Basiji cyber army and various
         units for surveillance of cyber space.  Those people are trawling
         the net all the time.  For them there is no boundary in terms of
         someone inside or outside Iran.  As to whether the security
         agencies have to be quite selective otherwise there would be too
         much information (to check), she said that it would be possible to
         do such searches if they had the technology. She understands that
         Iran does have the technology to download millions and millions of
         kilobytes of information and they have a huge number of people to
         do that.

    42.  She said that the surveillance is done from Iran on the web.  She
         was asked about surveillance of people, for example in the UK using
         Facebook and Twitter and to what extent the intelligence services
         would be interested in say, people cutting and pasting or clicking
         on 'likes'.  She said that that had all been gone through in AB and
         Others.  What is more certain is that when the person returns they
         will be asked to log onto their Facebook and email accounts and
         that those things will "out".

    43.  Referring to appendix IV of her report, she said that it appeared
         that people whose Facebook pages were used against them after their
         return had actually deleted those pages they said.  In relation to
         someone going to the embassy, an application would not be accepted
         unless it was voluntary and it was unlikely then that someone would
         go to the embassy voluntarily so the question was hypothetical.
         Even if a person said that what they had written was all 'rubbish',
         the person will have already committed the crime.  Whether it was
         possible for a person to go to the embassy as a failed asylum
         seeker and say that they had clicked on things that they should not
         have, she said that that was highly unlikely.

    44.  Referred to her report at [57], as to the possibility that a
         person might be asked in an application for an ETD about their
         social media use, anything is possible and she did not know what a
         person was going to be asked apart from their immigration and
         migration history.  She knew of people who had had to get an ETD
         because they had lost their passport.  As to whether it was
         unlikely that a failed asylum seeker would seek an ETD from the
         embassy, she said that anything is possible but she did not know if
         that would happen at the embassy.  She knows that people have been
         penalised for possessing very little material or even after having
         said that such material was not their own.

    45.  She said that she had read SSH and HR.  Those people did obtain an
         ETD and returned.  In answer to the suggestion that she was
         reluctant to address the possibility that when a failed asylum
         seeker admits to being such, they would be asked questions about
         social media, that is because she does not know.  There is no
         requirement to be a good person to get an ETD.  The authorities are
         interested in that information.  We know about people asked about
         their internet profile at the airport or, as in relation to the
         people mentioned at appendix IV, who were convicted.

    46.  As to whether one would not hear about someone who was not put in
         detention who admitted what they had said and done on social media,
         she said that she could not dream about a scenario like that.  If
         Dr Kakhki had said that they were, then they were.

    47.  Referred to her report at page 26 in relation to undocumented
         refugees, she said she could not put a percentage on the number who
         had no birth certificate but according to government figures it did
         happen.

    48.  As to what she said at [63]-[64] of her report about obtaining a
         replacement birth certificate outside Iran, one would have to find
         two Iranian nationals in this country.  One has to distinguish the
         situation where a person's birth is not registered so the national
         register only has information about the parents.  The point about
         asking people to bring witnesses or documents with photographs is
         that they have to be able to say that the person is in fact the
         person they claim to be.  If they do not have photo ID there is no
         procedure from abroad.  The matter is referred to the police in
         Iran to resolve.  So the police in Sardasht or somewhere would ask
         who you can get to verify your identity.  Presumably they have a
         procedure.  That is in the hands of the police to decide.  But the
         person must be present.

    49.  With reference to [65] of her report and whether she was saying
         that the appellant's uncle could not under any circumstances obtain
         a copy of his birth certificate, she said that he could not obtain
         a replacement copy and send it to him.  The appellant must apply at
         the Consulate here with his witnesses.

    50.  Ms Enayat was asked whether security officers are capable of
         distinguishing between expedient reasons for expressing dissenting
         views in a claim and genuine ones. She agreed that that could be
         done if the person tells them that.  However, the default position
         of the Iranian security forces is that they are all liars.  What is
         important to them is that the person has been saying nasty things
         about the Iranian State.  Referring to what she had said in her
         report about Article 500 (of the Islamic Penal Code), she said that
         if the regime wanted to prosecute an asylum seeker for an act of
         asylum itself they have got many means of being able to do so.
         They want to pick out people whose conduct they do not like.
         However, one also needed to go back to the fact that there were few
         returns and most people would not want to go back voluntarily.  The
         purpose is to pick out people with dissenting views.  She agreed
         that they would ask about the contents of an asylum claim.  A
         person has to apply for a special type of passport.  They write
         down the content of the asylum claim and the person signs to say
         that they regret the claim.  It is recorded in the passport in a
         passport number code.

    51.  It was put to Ms Enayat that if the focus was on people
         politically active, the authorities would be less concerned with
         people who 'liked' offensive images on Facebook.  She disagreed,
         saying that it was not likely that they would forgive the type of
         images (on the appellant's Facebook) that she had seen.  If an
         official had seen those things the person would be likely to be
         beaten and taken to Evin Prison for questioning.  As to whether
         there would be a greater risk of ill-treatment if the person was
         politically active, she said that they would not know and they
         would have to find out.

    52.  In relation to [71] of her report (interviews of returnees to see
         if they have been politically active), she said that she had some
         additional examples of information on that issue beyond 2001-2012,
         in her answers to written questions, and two others.  Some of the
         material was considered in  SSH and HR but fewer than she had
         collected.  She is looking at the matter in the wider context.

    53.  As to [80] (questioning at the airport and detention), she agreed
         that those matters were considered previously by the Tribunal but
         she needed to refer to it because of her instructions from the
         solicitors.  She did not accept was that there was no evidence that
         interviews do not take place.

    54.  In relation to [82] the International Organisation for Migration
         ("IOM") explicitly states that it is not concerned with monitoring.
          She was not clear what happened after 2010 in terms of the
         administration of voluntary returns on behalf of the Secretary of
         State.  She did not think it worthwhile to make enquiries of the
         IOM itself.  That is a small point and was only concerned with
         voluntary returns.

    55.  In terms of background checks ([85]-[87] of her report), they
         would occur in relation to people with temporary documents
         voluntarily returning or people who are forcibly returned whatever
         the documentation.  Not all returning asylum seekers are on
         temporary documents.  For example, if a passport had expired or
         there was an illegal exit without a passport, the Rules state that
         the person can only have an ETD.  That is the way the system works.

    56.  As to whether she is categoric that there would be social media
         checks on return, she said that she could not be categoric about
         anything but it was a reasonable likelihood.  She thinks it
         unlikely that the type of social media use like that of this
         appellant would be ignored.

    57.  As to the possibility that no 'hits' would be registered because
         of a transliteration issue, she said that it would be likely that
         they would try others because of the differences in
         transliteration.  She does not know how long they would spend on
         investigating different transliterations, spellings or variations
         of spellings.

    58.  She reiterated that her report had said that the majority of
         returnees were not at risk.  The majority of those returning
         voluntarily would not be at risk.  It was then suggested to her
         that people who go back voluntarily may include those who claimed
         ideological or political dissent.  She said that the security
         forces might or might not accept what a person said and the enquiry
         would then go on to the next stage.  She could not give an average
         as to how long the questioning would take.  The sources show that
         it can take some time.  In relation to a voluntary returnee, she is
         confident that it would not take more than a few hours.

    59.  As to whether the appellant would be viewed as a person who had
         exited Iran illegally, because he had left Iraq and returned to
         Iran before coming to the UK, the authorities would say that he had
         to prove that he was an Iranian citizen.  The fact of the matter is
         that any return of the appellant is hypothetical because of
         documentation.

    60.  Ms Enayat referred to a quoted remark from the Norwegian
         immigration authority which said that there were always
         documentation problems from Kurds from the camps in Iraq. The
         appellant's position would be no different.  Kurds in the camps
         from Iraq do not have a birth certificate so it is very difficult
         to document them from afar.

    61.  As to why the appellant would be regarded as from Iraq and not
         from Iran, she said that the authorities are interested in the
         backgrounds of Iranians who had resided for a long time in Iraq.
         To the proposition that it was not likely that he would be punished
         for exiting Iran illegally, she said that he might if they brought
         a political case against him because of the material on the
         internet and he would be fined for illegal exit.  However, he left
         in about 1994 so she is not saying that he would be punished for
         illegal exit.  He would first have to face a court on the issue of
         illegal exit.  He would be viewed as someone brought up in Iraq.
         They would want to know where and what he was doing in Iraq and
         there would be an investigation.  There is a system of vetting and
         monitoring those from Iraq.

    62.  She agreed that it would not be difficult to establish that he was
         not 'on their radar' in Iraq but he would have to go through the
         process (of investigation).  He would have to convince them.  What
         he said would be cross-referenced with information the Iranian
         authorities have and that would take time.  They would detain him
         until they established the truth.

    63.  Apart from the social media issue, there was his parentage.  He
         would not be punished for the fact of his house being burnt down
         and if the social media profile was not known she is not saying
         that he would be beaten up and so forth, but the questioning would
         be lengthy.

    64.  In order to be documented the issue of his parents would have to
         come out.  Maybe the witnesses would be reluctant to say that they
         know him.  As to whether the risk of ill-treatment would be
         increased because his parents disappeared in 1996, she said that
         she thought he would be exposed to more prolonged questioning.

    65.  In relation to his account of his fear of being exposed to the
         Iranian authorities because of selling the land to fund his travel,
         she said that he would have had to have sold the land by
         traditional methods as he is not documented.  The sale would have
         to be written down and his fingerprint would need to be accepted by
         the parties.

    66.  When she refers to "internet activism" in her report, as was
         established in AB and Others that would be regarded as the
         equivalent of NGO activity.  In relation to an asylum seeker in the
         UK who had, for example , 'liked' a page involving Greenpeace, she
         did not think that the authorities would mind about that.  As to
         whether therefore, not all internet activism would necessarily be
         of interest, she said that if a person was in Iran now and had that
         website they would be in trouble if they 'liked' a page which was
         linked to some Iranian environmental organisation.  The Iranian
         authorities would not distinguish between a 'like' and a re-posting
         of material, or the originating material.  If one posted that sort
         of material one would be caught and put in prison.  She referred to
         an example in her report of a person who had only written two lines
         without any other political activity.  Obviously they would be
         interested in the organisers.  She gave another example from 2008-
         2009 of a group in a chat room discussing religion.  The originator
         got well over 10 years in prison and a woman who made a couple of
         remarks got three or four years.

    67.  Questioned again about the appellant's Facebook posts she said
         that she was absolutely certain that in relation to that material
         he would be persecuted, and that had nothing to do with Article
         500.  There are many cases where there is persecution for this type
         of material.   In the past several years travellers are asked to
         login to their Facebook or email accounts, although not everyone.
         Everyone who had something like that would be prosecuted.  In Iran
         people are very, very careful about having such material.  Article
         500 can cover almost anything.

    68.  In re-examination, when asked about what would happen if the
         appellant repeated the content of his asylum claim in terms of his
         house being burnt by the state when he was a child because of his
         parents' association with separatist groups, he might be given a
         slap round the ears for that.  They would not like it but they
         would not put him in prison because of it unless he repeated it
         publicly.  They may harass him in Sardasht or wherever he goes
         afterwards. If he articulated support for Kurdish rights in
         interview then he would be in trouble.

    69.  In cases where a person is an activist, such as by attending
         Kurdish meetings abroad, that would be culpable.  Their threshold
         for activism is very different from ours.  Political activism and
         someone insulting the state through Facebook are not mutually
         exclusive.  Sometimes they overlap and sometimes they do not.  She
         would agree with what was said at [65] of BA ("While it may well be
         that an appellant's participation in demonstrations is
         opportunistic, the evidence suggests that this is not likely to be
         a major influence on the perception of the regime"), if one
         substituted opportunistic demonstrations for opportunistic internet
         activity.  With reference to her report at [83] and the 2005
         material set out there in relation to the duration of returnee
         interviews, she has no reason to believe that the situation had
         improved such that the pattern of behaviour would be different now.

    70.  She would agree that if there are relatively few returnees,
         especially forced returnees, the more scrutiny there would be.  She
         often ponders that the refusal to issue documentation is on the
         basis that they do not want to deal with that population of people.

    71.  Illegal exit, and residence in Iraq, are two discrete potential
         risk factors but they are potentially cumulative.

    Professor Emile Joff�

    72.  In examination-in-chief Professor Joff� explained his familiarity
         with the issue of Kurds in Iran and Iraq, as well as with the facts
         of the appellant's case.

    73.  He was asked what factor Kurdish ethnicity would play in relation
         to someone with no political profile of any kind.  He said that
         until fairly recently Kurdish ethnicity was not a very significant
         point but Kurds are treated very differently.  Since 2016 the
         situation has been very different.  There has been a consistent
         pattern of attacks between Iran and the PJAK.  That and the attack
         on the shrine of Khomenei has worsened the situation of the Kurds.
         The people involved were Kurds and many others from Kurdistan
         assisted providing backup.  There had been a truce in place for
         around 21 years.

    74.  The significance of the June 2017 incidents in Tehran (the attack
         on the Parliament and the shrine complex) is in terms of the
         personnel involved.  There were four Kurds in the team and
         investigations showed that it involved a network of Jihadi
         extremists.  Previously attacks would have been based on
         nationalist sentiments but those were now a religiously based
         ideology.  That had not before been shown in relation to Kurds.

    75.  Another change is the new Political Crimes Law ("PCL") of 2016.
         Combined with Article 500, people who had claimed asylum would also
         by implication be criticising the regime.  Given the worsening
         situation for Kurds, a Kurd would attract greater attention than
         might previously have been the case.  There has been a hardening of
         attitudes and this also might be due to increased tension since
         2009.  Article 500 and the PCL mean that it is for the person to
         demonstrate their innocence.  As to examples of the law being used
         against people, he said that he did not think that there are any
         reports yet as the Iranian judicial system is very opaque but it
         has been commented on, for example by NGOs elsewhere.  He imagines
         that a large part of the purpose is to deter people from making
         political statements abroad.  If a person left illegally they would
         be questioned on return.

    76.  The regime does not tolerate criticism, especially abroad.  It is
         not a question of whether a person is a threat to state security.
         It is what you have said which will determine whether you would be
         questioned or persecuted.  This answer was given in relation to an
         example suggested in terms of a person whose asylum claim was
         rejected because their activity was at too low a level but the
         claim or account was nevertheless accepted.  As to what added
         significance there may be, if any, of a person being Kurdish, he
         said that that would increase suspicion generally in relation to
         those that had applied for asylum.  Given the incidents he had
         referred to and the referendum in Kurdistan, more time would be
         spent in investigating that person who would be felt to be more of
         a threat to security than someone in another group.

    77.  In relation to the new PCL, the burden is on the individual to
         show that they are innocent.  That is said in the commentaries on
         it by the US State Department especially.  He agreed that that was
         probably in terms of its implementation.  He is not certain how a
         person would be able to demonstrate their innocence.  He thought
         that this law is more severe than Article 500.  He is not aware of
         any government explanation of what the PCL intended to achieve.

    78.  Kurdistan had been a constant problem for Iran, both before and
         after the revolution.  The 200,000 troops garrisoned there is
         significant in terms of Kurdistan having one tenth of the
         population of Iran.  He also thinks that the Baluchis and Ahwazi
         Arabs in the south are also at increased risk.

    79.  As per his report, he agreed that a laissez-passer is only issued
         to those who agree to return, at least so far as the UK is
         concerned.  Other countries claim not to be able to return people
         on a laissez-passer so the situation is not clear.

    80.  As to whether persons returning to Iran voluntarily presumably
         have no subjective fear, he said that it may be that they have a
         fear but it is not so great as to prevent them from returning.

    81.  In relation to the appellant's Facebook posts, the likely reaction
         of the authorities he thinks would be pretty bad.  They would take
         quite an exception to quite a few of the images.  He considered
         that there would be a very difficult period of questioning and a
         lengthy prison sentence.  The questioning would be both physically
         and verbally difficult.  He could not imagine a scenario when that
         would simply be waived through.

    82.  Absent a voluntary admission, as to the likelihood of the process
         of return revealing that material, he said that the Iranian
         authorities monitored the internet, especially Facebook. At least
         one of the images has got his name on it.  As to whether he was
         suggesting that every returnee is monitored, he said that that was
         speculation and he just did not know.  However, they have a
         considerable capacity for monitoring the internet.  He has dealt
         with several cases where this has been claimed.  He did not think
         it would make any difference if the appellant admitted that he did
         not believe in what was in the Facebook post or if it was
         opportunistic.

    83.  If the appellant said that he came from Iraq, the first thing is
         that it would mean that he had left Iran illegally.  The second
         question would be as to why he went to Iraq.  It would be pre-
         supposed that he would be connected with the opposition movements
         which are all centred in Iraq.

    84.  In cross-examination he agreed that his last visit to Iran was in
         1999.  He had not visited the Kurdish regions of Iran but had been
         to Iraq for two weeks in March 2011.  He had not been to the
         Kurdish regions in Syria, Turkey or Azerbaijan.  He does not speak
         Kurdish Sorani or Persian.  He agreed that he was reliant on the
         English language translations of the reports to which he had
         referred.

    85.  The rural administration in Iran is deficient in terms of access
         to birth certificates and land sales.  Land sales are a matter of
         private agreement and people would not think of the need to
         register the sale.   So it is perfectly possible that a private
         transaction could have occurred (in terms of the sale of the
         appellant's land).  As to whether it was still important to verify
         that a person has the title to sell, it really does not work like
         that.  People in the village know who owns what. A notary would
         have been involved.  That does not mean that a person would need
         identity documents because if people agreed that he owned the land
         it could be sold.

    86.  As to whether it would be somewhat unusual to someone who had not
         been in Iran since the age of six to say that they owned land, he
         said that normally people are well aware of who owns the land even
         if people have been away for a long time.  People in that
         circumstance do not require a lengthy process.  However, he does
         not know enough about the process of his sale, which could have
         been through his uncle.

    87.  The appellant could be liable for exiting Iran illegally both in
         relation to 1996 and 2015.  In relation to a six-year-old, he does
         not know the age of criminal responsibility but generally the age
         would be quite low.  He does not think the decision would be made
         on that basis but on the basis of the family decision.  People are
         held collectively responsible for the activities of their
         relatives.  The point is not whether he would be liable as a matter
         of law.

    88.  In answer to our questions, he said that he really does not know
         whether the appellant would be prosecuted for illegal exit as a six-
         year-old but there would be an investigation.  He was unable to
         speculate.

    89.  In further cross-examination he said he was quite sure that it
         would be the case that the authorities would be more concerned with
         the exiting in 2015 as an adult.

    90.  In relation to the decision in SSH and HR on illegal exit and
         there being very little risk, he agreed generally with the
         Tribunal's conclusions were it not for two additional factors;
         firstly, the attacks in Tehran given that Kurds were strongly
         implicated, and secondly the general deterioration in relations in
         the Middle East generally.  He did not agree that but for those two
         factors the appellant would not be at risk.  The question is of the
         penalty.  He certainly would be questioned about illegal exit, but
         the situation has now changed in the respects to which he had
         referred.  In his report he was commenting on the situation of
         return now.  At the time when he wrote his report he did not think
         that the Tribunal was right in what it said.  There is an increased
         likelihood of prosecution.  All he can say is that the situation
         for Kurds has probably degenerated significantly.  He has not
         reviewed the information to see if the same applies to everybody.

    91.  As to [12] of his report, and what he said about dozens of Kurds
         being arrested without warrants for real or perceived links with
         Kurdish political movements, he said that the security forces
         considered that they were linked to the KDPI (Kurdish Democratic
         Party of Iran). They believe that they do have evidence to support
         that view.  He was referring to a statement by Amnesty
         International.  He is not in a position to explain why the Iranian
         authorities act as they do.  He is aware of particular cases where
         links are perceived, for example there has been quite a lot of
         reporting of people acting as smugglers across the border being
         accused of links when they do not have any.  He could not comment
         on whether or not that was just an excuse (by the security forces).

    92.  In terms of people who are merely related (to others of interest),
         there tends to be a collective view of liability and
         responsibility. He does not have evidence or examples of such cases
         in the materials before the Tribunal. People do claim to have been
         arrested for that reason.  He is referring to blood relationships.

    93.  In relation to a child whose parents disappeared more than 20
         years ago, it is quite possible that a child would be regarded as
         equally dangerous as the parents.  It might be assumed that he
         would be hostile towards them for that reason alone.  The crucial
         thing is the male line.

    94.  As to there being no report of any incident having occurred in
         relation to the appellant's uncle for a period of 20 years, he said
         that he could not make any assumptions on the basis that he has no
         evidence.

    95.  He does not know that it is the case that mainstream Kurdish
         society and IS are extremely hostile towards each other.  He agreed
         that the Iranian authorities now have a reasonably clear idea of
         the nature and extent of IS involvement but they are also concerned
         about all the groups.  He is not in a position to say that it is an
         incredibly small minority, but it is a minority of support for IS
         (in the Western provinces).  He is not able to comment on what the
         "common appreciation" is in relation to western provinces' support.
          He is not aware of any sample of views of the academic community
         on the issue.  As to whether there is a belief that there is great
         support for IS in the western provinces, there is not great support
         but there is support which is founded on a religious view.  One
         cannot be precise about these things.

    96.  Asked whether all Kurds in Iran are Sunni, he said they are not
         but the majority are.  He was unable to give details as to the
         exact percentage and refused to speculate on whether it could be,
         for example, at least 50%.

    97.  He believes that people of Kurdish extraction would face a greater
         degree of scrutiny on return than others and than would have been
         the case before.  Asked about other minority groups, he said each
         of the minority groups have specific difficulties with the regime.
         In relation to smugglers, it is not simply that there is increased
         scrutiny of them because they are smuggling but because of the
         political implications.  There is considerable traffic across the
         border on a daily basis.  It is true that the authorities are
         probably concerned about smuggling per se.  However, so far as
         politics is concerned, it would probably be assumed that they would
         be involved in that as well.

    98.  A person in the appellant's situation who is facing return would
         be subject to certain formal questions at the embassy but that
         would not be an interrogation.  He referred to [128] of his report
         in terms of what would be required by the embassy in London.  The
         authorities in Tehran would authorise the issuing of a travel
         document.  This was all in the context of questions asked about
         whether there would be any security screening for a person who may
         be a potential threat.

    99.  Asked whether he was saying that failed Kurdish asylum seekers
         would have political motives attributed to them, he said they would
         not but they would be suspected.  He referred to a footnote at page
         27 of his report being the source for information in relation to
         the arrest in 2011 of a Kurd who was returned to Iran from Norway.
         He was not suggesting that that incident happened because the
         person was simply of Kurdish ethnicity.

    100. Professor Joff� was asked about the proposition at [105] of his
         report that the Iranian authorities assume that all asylum seekers
         who are returned have engaged in anti-regime activities whilst
         abroad, especially in spreading false information about the Islamic
         Republic.  In response to the suggestion that he had made an
         impermissible leap from one Kurdish refugee being returned in 2011
         to the general statement that anyone as a failed asylum seeker
         would be assumed to having engaged in sur place activities, he said
         that the two statements were quite distinct.  He would have to
         investigate to answer as to whether there is other material to
         justify his conclusion in this respect.

    101. In relation to the article by the former judge in the newspaper
         Kayhan (described in his report as a newspaper controlled by the
         Supreme Leader's office), it is a reasonable inference from this
         article that the official view is that there is increased scrutiny
         of asylum seekers.

    102. In relation to [107] in terms of failed asylum seekers facing an
         enhanced threat of being considered to have defamed the Islamic
         Republic whilst abroad, and whether he was aware that there were
         any specific instances where this had applied, he said that it was
         a reasonable inference from the evidence on the question of the
         reverse burden of proof previously referred to.  Professor Joff�
         maintained that it would be for the individual to demonstrate that
         they had not been involved in anti-regime activities whilst abroad.
          Pressed on evidence to support that contention, he said that an
         Amnesty International report referred to the article from Kayhan
         and repeated that the article was written by a former judge.

    103. Militant Sunnis or Kurds are not necessarily co-extensive although
         most militant networks identified are within Kurdistan.

    104. If a Kurdish returnee had applied for asylum he would be suspected
         of impugning the reputation of the state by demonstrating or taking
         part in sur place activities.  Being a failed asylum seeker would
         be enough, given the attitude he had referred to and what was said
         in the article in Kayhan.  As to whether his report between [114]-
         [120] did not go so far as to suggest that there was a real risk of
         persecution simply by being Kurdish, he said he disagreed and his
         understanding was that it does.  That was his inference from the
         evidence that he had seen.  In answer to the suggestion that all
         the material he relied on was considered by the Tribunal in SSH and
         HR and material since 2016 did not support the contention that
         there was a real risk of persecution for Kurdish returnees simply
         on the basis of their ethnicity, he said that he disagreed.

    105. In relation to the PCL, and whether there was evidence that people
         had been prosecuted under it, he said that apparently there had
         been a large number of people who had been prosecuted.  As to
         whether that related to failed asylum seekers who had been
         returned, he said that the activities of the courts are not
         necessarily made public.  He could not say if those people were
         prosecuted or not.  He did not think that it was at all possible
         that none of them were returned asylum seekers.

    106. As to [130(v)] of his report in terms of the lack of reporting of
         problems faced by failed Kurdish asylum seekers, he accepted that
         Kurdish organisations would be keen to publicise mistreatment of
         failed asylum seekers.  He also agreed that if a person had family
         in Iran word would leak out to Kurdish groups of a person's non-
         arrival.  He said that he was sure that NGOs would publicise such
         matters.

    107. In relation to surveillance by Iranian Intelligence Services, that
         had come up in the materials he had analysed.  He said that it
         seems to take place outside Iran but he had not worked on that
         matter specifically and does not claim to be an expert on it.  The
         Iranian Intelligence Services do however monitor the internet and
         it is quite likely that they would be aware of material on social
         media.  They are especially pre-occupied by Facebook.  He then said
         that they might be aware of it when they sign off on a travel
         document.

    108. If this appellant's Facebook material was disclosed, the
         authorities would take it very badly because it was insulting
         individual senior people in the regime.  It was not a question of
         whether it was a serious political activity but simply of the
         action of having done it.  He would be punished for that far more
         than if he represented a significant risk to the state.

    109. In relation to the authorities' understanding of a difference
         between 'liking' something on Facebook or being an active
         organiser, Professor Joff� said that the activities are of rather a
         different kind.  Activists outside the country reflect on the
         country's reputation.  Both are however treated seriously.  The
         Iranian government would argue that the sort of activity shown on
         Facebook damages the reputation of the country and therefore is a
         security threat.  If the appellant only 'shared' the material, he
         thought that that was more than 'liking' the material.

    110. If re-posting material, the authorities would draw a distinction.
         Evidence of re-posting material is evidence of disaffection with
         the state which would attract punishment.  As to whether account
         would be taken of the fact that a person's claim was rejected, he
         said he was absolutely certain that they would take no account of
         the context.

    111. As to whether the authorities' assessing a security threat are
         rational and would take into account opportunistic reasons for
         (social media material), he said that it was not that they were
         irrational but they do try to identify potential threats.  It is
         the anticipation of the potential threat which would lead to that
         person's condemnation.

    112. In re-examination he said that in relation to a distinction
         between a person who insults the state or is politically active
         against the state, it would depend on what article of the Penal
         Code the person had offended against.  To suggest that they would
         be somehow indulgent just because the activity was part of an
         asylum claim is not something that they would engage with.

    113. In relation to the Kayhan article, the significance of the fact
         that it is a newspaper controlled by the Supreme Leader's office is
         that it reflects the official view of the material published.  He
         does not know for how long the author of the report, the retired
         judge, had been retired for.

    114. Regarding a claim which was based on sexuality or adultery, the
         extent to which this would be seen as a statement against the state
         would depend on the degree to which the authorities were aware of
         the basis of the claim.  Any asylum claim is seen as a threat to
         the state.  A person would be tried under whatever Penal Code
         article applied.  A sexual claim would offend the Penal Code.

    115. In terms of the broader geo-political context and how individual
         security officers at the airport would behave, he could only
         surmise that everyone in Iran is aware of the geo-political
         situation in terms of the way they see the outside world.  They
         operate in an environment where this is a concern.  He does not
         know whether particular instructions go to security officers but
         many people would be prejudiced by the environment within which
         they operate.  People in Iran certainly know about the wider world.

    116. Asked whether, given the wide discrimination against Kurds, the
         appellant as a failed Kurdish asylum seeker and in the context of
         the events of 2016, as well as issues in relation to IS and the
         KDPI, would make the interrogation of the appellant much more acute
         and demanding, he said that there would be more willingness to
         impute activities by him as a threat to the state.

    117. He said he agreed with [65] of BA completely ("While it may well
         be that an appellant's participation in demonstrations is
         opportunistic, the evidence suggests that this is not likely to be
         a major influence on the perception of the regime"). The only
         change is to have intensified the situation in that the authorities
         are now even more concerned about dissent since the demonstrations
         of last December which were countrywide, unlike those of 2009.













































                                         ANNEX C

                                     SUBMISSIONS

    Respondents oral submissions

 1. Mr Metcalfe relied on his written submissions and referred to aspects
    of the written submissions provided on behalf of the appellant.  It was
    noted that the appellant did not seek to disturb the findings in SSH
    and HR, and what is said in the appellant's submissions at [12] in
    terms of the significance of SSH and HR.

Mr Metcalfe accepted on behalf of the respondent that there was a
distinction between failed asylum seekers' opportunistic claims, for
example in terms of religious beliefs or sexual orientation, and those that
are political claims in terms of Kurdish political support.  However, it
was submitted that that distinction does not show that Kurds are more at
risk than non-Kurds who make opportunistic political claims for asylum.

In terms of the criticism in the appellant's written submissions of what
was said at [30] of SSH and HR (degree of reality on the part of the
Iranian authorities in relation to false claims for economic betterment),
the Tribunal in SSH and HR was plainly aware of what was said in BA on the
same issue but the point was more general.  It was not limited to taking
part in sur place activities but was a more general assessment of
opportunistic claims.  The appellant seeks in this respect to expand what
was said at [65] of BA to the effect that that was the attitude of the
regime to all political claims, which is not what was said in BA.

It was agreed on behalf of the respondent that the Tribunal should not
guess as to the attitude of the Iranian authorities.  SSH and HR did not
find that failed asylum seekers were at risk generally.  As can be seen
from [2] and [3] of SSH and HR, both appellants there claimed that they
would be at risk of persecution on account of support for Kurdish groups
but they were not believed.  It was submitted that [28]-[29] indicate that
it was not speculation on the part of the Tribunal in SSH and HR where they
stated that one can expect a degree of reality on the part of the Iranian
authorities in relation to those who made asylum claims in the interests of
advancing their economic circumstances.

It was submitted that the same applied in relation to this appellant's
case.  One would have expected to see evidence of Kurdish refugees having
been singled out on return.  The Iranian authorities would be concerned
with those who are a threat and less concerned with others who were simply
failed asylum seekers.  The appellant does not advance direct evidence in
relation to the treatment of failed asylum seekers and the Secretary of
State does not have such evidence either.

In relation to the evidence relied on on behalf of the appellant at para
23.1 of the written submissions, the majority of that evidence is pre-2016.
 That is important because the appellant's case is that there has been a
deterioration in conditions.  However, there is no criticism on behalf of
the appellant of SSH and HR and so there is a mismatch between this, pre-
2016 material, and the present situation.

The appellant's written submissions at [23.2] make it clear that Ms Enayat
accepts the respondent's guidance (on returns).  Political activities in
Iran may be differently perceived from those in the UK.  The respondent's
guidance accepts that political activity or activity perceived as such
would create a risk.

In relation to the submissions on behalf of the appellant in relation to
Professor Joff�, the respondent accepted that the Tribunal is entitled to
consider evidence given in a previous country guidance case but the
Tribunal is bound by previous country guidance.  It should be very slow to
depart from an assessment of evidence given in previous country guidance.
Much of the material relied on in the case of this appellant was previously
considered in SSH and HR or was not material that was relied on.  It was
decided at [34] of SSH and HR that there would be no risk to a returnee on
the sole basis of being Kurdish.  Neither of the experts in this appeal
disputed the findings in SSH.

It was accepted on behalf of the respondent that conditions have
deteriorated.  However, it is less than two years since SSH and HR was
promulgated.  In relation to what is said at [35] of the appellant's
written submissions in terms of the respondent not having identified even
one Kurdish person who had been returned to Iran in recent years, let alone
one of Kurdish ethnicity who had made an asylum claim in the UK, that was
an inversion of the rules of proof.  However, it is not suggested that
there is a burden of proof on one party or another in a country guidance
appeal.  In terms of [39] - [45] of the appellant's written submissions,
the background material referred to is highly generic and sheds very little
light on the country guidance issue to be determined.

In terms of [46] onwards of the appellant's submissions, the expert
evidence before us was not to the effect that there was widespread support
for IS amongst Kurds.  Although [49] of the submissions refers to the
dramatic increase in the rate of Iranian asylum claims in the UK, one does
not know if any of those were Kurds.  It is likely that some were but one
could not make any deductions from the rise in such applications.
Furthermore, although it is suggested at [50] of the appellant's written
submissions that the authorities are much more likely to impute dissident
views to Iranians of Kurdish ethnicity and the circumstances which give
rise to a real risk of persecution are much wider for them than for non-
Kurdish citizens, no examples have been given and both witnesses were
pressed on that issue.  The example given of EL, who had a leaflet or
leaflets in his possession, was a very poor example to support the
assertions of risk.

It was accepted on behalf of the respondent that Kurds are more likely to
be punished more harshly but the experts were not able to give examples of
the persecution of Kurds as failed asylum seekers.

In terms of the issue of a person being tainted by association, both
experts were questioned about that.  Professor Joff� suggested that the
appellant would be prosecuted in relation to events that occurred when he
was a six year old.  It was submitted, however, that that was not credible.
 No other cases have been referred to of circumstances in which a person
left Iran as a child.

What is suggested about the PCL effectively reversing the burden of proof
is "a lost cause".

The suggestions as to proposed country guidance in the appellant's
submissions were criticised in various respects by Mr Metcalfe including in
terms of those suggestions going wider than the country guidance issue.  It
was however, accepted that the proposition that making, re-posting or
otherwise publicising critical, insulting, satirical or otherwise adverse
comments about Islam, the regime and so forth, could create a risk if the
authorities know about it.  It was also accepted that there was a risk of
imprisonment or being held in detention for questioning or investigation or
pending trial would be at risk of treatment contrary to Article 3.  It was
agreed that this was uncontroversial.

In summary, it was submitted on behalf of the respondent that there was
nothing to add in addition to the country guidance in SSH and HR of 2016.
None of the evidence indicates that the current country guidance should be
altered.

    Appellant's oral submissions

Ms Naik pointed out that SSH and HR was only heard over one day.  It
consists of 34 paragraphs and two appendices.  That part of the decision
relating to Kurds is extremely brief and was not a country guidance issue.
To identify risks, the Tribunal needs to be alive to the context in the
treatment of Kurds now in Iran.

It was accepted that there may need to be "inferential conclusions" based
on the expert evidence.  In SSH and HR there was one expert, Dr Kakhki.  It
is not suggested on behalf of the appellant that Professor Joff� or Ms
Enayat disagree with his evidence although they elucidate matters.

The respondent agrees that those suspected of being or who are politically
active are at risk.  The question is what is in the minds of the Iranian
border guards.  It is not just an issue of the 'pinch-point' or the point
of return.  We were invited to give the fullest guidance possible in
relation to political activity in terms of what is or what is perceived to
be political activity and why being a Kurd is an additional risk factor.

AB and Others is not country guidance but is a reported decision and has a
headnote.  That evidence and its conclusions do need to be examined.  SSH
and HR did not really consider that decision, although it was referred to
to some degree.  It was submitted that SSH and HR is not the start and end
point for this Tribunal's consideration of country guidance.

In terms of [30] of SSH and HR, it was accepted that the Iranian
authorities may well be able to make a distinction between opportunistic
claims and others, but that does not mean that they will (in fact) make
such a distinction. It was suggested that the Tribunal in SSH and HR went
slightly wrong at [30] in that context.

Absent this appellant's internet activity, his claim is based on pro-
Kurdish views, his parents and the area in which he lived.  The question is
how he would be treated by the Iranian State.

In terms of the respondent's written submissions at [1f] in terms of the
appellant's particular case, the question is, is there a risk that the
authorities would be aware of any support by the appellant's parents for
Kurdish groups.

It was submitted that following AB and Others the appellant would be asked
for his passwords, and some of his posts are publicly available.  His
Kurdish ethnicity makes questioning of him more likely and there is an
issue in terms of the level of severity of any ill-treatment.

Since 2016 there are new circumstances to take into account as set out in
the written submissions.  The respondent accepted in submissions that the
Iranian authorities are not wholly unconcerned with refugees whose claims
have failed.  The process of return would establish the facts.  One needed
to consider how a person would be perceived.

There was no evidence from the respondent in relation to the details of
returns and the respondent is the only source from which that information
could be provided.  The respondent had chosen not to provide the
information.  Although in SSH and HR there was evidence from Mr Griffiths
(the Assistant Director of Immigration Enforcement) dated February 2016 in
relation to the numbers of failed asylum seekers who had been returned to
Iran, that evidence pre-dated the change in circumstances in Iran.  The
nature of the State of Iran is a necessary backdrop to assessment of risk.
The evidence indicates how repressive the regime has become, and reference
was made to the written submissions in terms of the evolution of the
regime's attitude.

In the accepted context of discrimination against Kurds, the question is
really how that would impact on the behaviour of (say) border guards.  It
was, however, accepted that evidence was not given about Salafists,
although that was part of the context.

    Respondent's written submissions

The starting point for the treatment of failed asylum seekers to Iran
remains the decision in SSH and HR.

The majority of the material relied on by Ms Enayat and Professor Joff� was
considered in SSH and HR. Although they refer to some evidence post-dating
that decision, none of them address directly the country guidance point in
issue in this appeal. Ms Enayat did not disagree with paras 2.3.2 and 2.3.3
of the CIG of 2016 on Kurds and Kurdish groups, namely that the evidence
does not disclose that there is a risk to Kurdish returnees on the grounds
of ethnicity alone unless the person is otherwise of interest to the
authorities.

Professor Joff� was not able to provide any evidential basis for his
contention that the PCL imposed on the accused person the burden of proving
innocence of a political crime.

The Iranian authorities are capable of distinguishing between Kurds who
genuinely engaged in political activity and those who merely claimed to be
engaged in such activity to bolster an asylum claim.

The First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") did not accept the appellant's account that
his parents' disappearance in 1996 was due to their support for Kurdish
groups and nor was there evidence before the FtT to show that he was
politically active. There was no evidence to show that the authorities in
Iran would impute political views to the appellant or treat him as in need
of investigation. He left Iran when he was 6 years old and he had not been
politically active in the KRI.

However, it was accepted that if the Iranian authorities became aware of
it, the appellant would be liable to criminal prosecution but there was no
reliable evidence to show that the Iranian authorities would "necessarily"
be aware of his social media use or that he would disclose his support for
Kurdish rights if questioned.

In SSH and HR the Tribunal heard expert evidence from Dr Kakhki. The
evidence before the Tribunal addressed the issue of illegal exit and failed
asylum seekers but also considered specific evidence on the treatment of
Kurds. Although the respondent accepted the conclusion of Upper Tribunal
Judge Storey in the error of law decision in this appellant's case that
Kurdish ethnicity was not one of the issues identified for country guidance
in SSH and HR, it was wrong for the appellant to mischaracterise SSH and HR
as not addressing the risk to Kurds on account of their ethnicity. The
findings in that decision remain the starting point for the guidance in the
present appeal.

In relation to Ms Enayat's evidence, the respondent did not dispute that a
Kurd who is politically active is likely to be more harshly treated than a
non-Kurdish Iranian who is politically active, but that does not show an
increased risk to Kurdish returnees simply by virtue of the fact that they
are Kurdish.

Although she gave evidence of the worsening political situation since 2016
and that as a result of these tensions Kurds returning from abroad were
likely to be the subject of "heightened scrutiny", she agreed that there
was a lack of evidence to show that failed Kurdish asylum seekers had in
fact been subject to enhanced scrutiny on that basis. She was similarly
unable to state the likelihood of a Kurdish returnee being the subject of
secondary checks. She stopped short of saying that heightened scrutiny of
Kurds would, in and of itself, give rise to a real risk of ill-treatment or
persecution. Likewise in terms of the mere fact of being a returning
Kurdish  failed asylum seeker.

As with Ms Enayat, the evidence relied on by Professor Joff� in relation to
the risk to Kurdish failed asylum seekers mostly dates from before 2016
(and SSH and HR). Much of his evidence was concerned with "broader
geopolitical shifts" in the middle east since 2016 but there were numerous
deficiencies when it came to demonstrating how such shifts affected the
treatment of failed asylum seekers. Professor Joff�'s knowledge of the
region was accepted but his evidence in relation to the PCL (and the
suggested reverse burden of proof) was indicative of a general want of
accuracy on his part and a tendency to overstate his testimony, often in
sweeping terms. His evidence had been criticised in AB (Algeria, scope of
remittals) Algeria [2004] UKIAT 00323.

The evidence of Professor Joff� in relation to the risks faced by failed
Kurdish asylum seekers post 2016 should be accorded relatively little
weight.

The evidence fails to show that Kurdish ethnicity, even when combined with
other factors, such as illegal exit and/or claiming asylum abroad, would
give rise to a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment. None of the post-
2016 evidence is enough to displace the findings of SSH and SR. On the
appellant's case ('very little else in addition to Kurdish ethnicity is
required') any Kurdish failed asylum seeker (other than one who claimed
asylum on grounds of religious belief or sexuality) would face a real risk
since it is almost always` the case that their asylum claim involved some
form of opposition to the Iranian government or support for Kurdish rights.

The authorities in Iran are capable of distinguishing between returnees who
are politically active and those who claim to be so for purely
opportunistic purposes. Ms Enayat accepted that the purpose of questioning
of returnees was to identify those who posed a real threat to security. The
evidence to date remains broadly consistent with the country guidance in
SSH and SR and that in the CIG, version 2 of 2016.

As to the appellant's appeal, the FtT did not accept the appellant's claim
as to the reasons for his parents' disappearance or the burning down of
their house (namely support for Kurdish groups). The reason for the burning
down of the house remains unknown, the third hand account of the
appellant's uncle being some 20 years after the fact. The article by
Hamidreza Jalaeipour relied on by Ms Enayat does not support her suggestion
that these events happened because the village was used as a supply route
for Kurdish groups and thus attracted reprisals by the Revolutionary Guard.
That article describes a different tactic used, namely the shelling of
villages from a distance. In any event, the burning down of houses is a
tactic used by many groups in the region.

At best, the destruction of his parents' house and their disappearance
might prompt some additional questioning by the Iranian authorities. The
fact that the appellant's uncle remained in the same village as his parents
without apparent difficulty for more than two decades shows that it is
unlikely that the Iranian authorities would have any continuing interest in
the appellant for those reasons.

Ms Enayat said "possibly not" in answer to the question of whether the
authorities would seek to prosecute the appellant for having left Iran when
he was 6 years old. The evidence of Professor Joff� on this point was not
credible. In addition, in SSH and HR concluded that prosecution for illegal
exit was not generally experienced by returnees and when it is, the likely
sentence is a fine.

The evidence of Ms Enayat is accepted in terms of the appellant being
likely to face additional questioning by reason of having lived in the KRI
for so many years. However, she did not say that he would therefore face a
real risk of ill-treatment or persecution as a result.

It is accepted that the material posted by the appellant on Facebook, if it
became known to the authorities, would expose him to prosecution with a
risk of imprisonment and that this would result in a real risk of ill-
treatment. It is also accepted that the appellant's Facebook page is
currently visible to the public at large. However, there is insufficient
evidence that the Iranian authorities would necessarily be aware of that
material. There is also insufficient evidence to show that the Iranian
authorities routinely inspect the internet profiles of failed asylum
seekers.

As to the appellant's claim that he would be obliged to reveal his support
for Kurdish rights under questioning, either at the consulate and/or at the
airport on return, the question of what an individual would actually say if
questioned is a factual finding which must be made upon the basis of all
the evidence (Secretary of State for the Home Department v MH
(PA/02219/2017), 7 December 2017). There was no evidence from the appellant
to show that he would disclose his political opinions in such circumstances
and the FtT did not find a risk in that respect.

    Appellant's written submissions

The appellant's Kurdish ethnicity is a risk factor rather than a risk
category. The act of return crystallises that risk factor into a real risk
of persecution when it is reasonably likely that the circumstances of
return will lead the authorities to investigate the returnee. That is
likely to occur when the returnee has no passport, left Iran illegally
and/or claimed asylum abroad wherein he has criticised the state. Kurdish
ethnicity in those circumstances would increase the likelihood that the
regime will suspect the returnee of having claimed asylum on grounds which
challenge the authority of the state. Similarly, Kurdish ethnicity
increases the likelihood that the regime will respond to any perception of
political opposition with persecutory action.

The appellant does not seek to disturb the country guidance of SSH and HR.
As per the appellant's skeleton argument, in his error of law decision
Judge Storey found that Kurdish ethnicity was not one of the issues
identified for country guidance in that case and thus fell outside the
Practice Direction at para 12.2. Although the Tribunal in SSH and HR did
address the issue of Kurdish ethnicity it did so briefly and did not issue
country guidance on the point.

The FtT made credibility findings that were largely in the appellant's
favour but erred when it went on to dismiss the appeal because it
mistakenly treated SSH and HR as binding country guidance on the issue of
risk on return for Kurds. The credibility findings were preserved.

SSH and HR "sets out the starting position" for assessment of whether the
appellant would be at risk if all that were known about him was that he had
left Iran unlawfully and claimed asylum in the UK. According to the country
guidance in SSH and HR the answer would be 'no'. However, that is not the
end of the matter because it does not address the substance of the
appellant's claim.

It is not the appellant's case that any Kurdish failed asylum seeker would
be at risk simply by virtue of being Kurdish. There is no basis for the
respondent's suggestion that the Iranian authorities are capable of
distinguishing Kurds genuinely engaged in political activity and those
doing so to bolster an asylum claim. The point in any event is not whether
they are capable of making such a distinction but whether they do. Both
experts agreed with what was said in BA at [65] about opportunistic
involvement in demonstrations not being likely to be a major influence on
the perception of the regime and that expressing dissent itself will be
sufficient to result in a person having a significant political profile in
the eyes of the regime.

In so far as SSH and HR came to a different view in relation to the issue
of motivation at [30], that view is obiter in relation to the country
guidance issues in the case and wrongly departs from previous country
guidance (BA).

Reference is made in the written submissions to evidence said to indicate
the "extreme sensitivity" of the Iranian authorities to even slight
indications of dissent, whether at home or abroad. The oral evidence of the
experts is also relied on in this context, with various examples cited.

It is acknowledged that several of the examples given by the experts in
this case of those persecuted on return were considered in SSH and HR
(albeit in the context of what that case was considering).

As regards the figures for numbers of returnees to Iran, whether those
disclosed in SSH and HR or those in the public domain provided by the
respondent in this case in respect to the disclosure request, they say
nothing about the content of claims for asylum that were made. The figures
do not reveal how many of the returnees were Kurdish, or if they were,
whether the elements of the claim contained anything such as a challenge to
the authority of the state. Thus, the respondent's complaint as to a lack
of evidence relating to the treatment of Kurdish returnees (and in relation
to failed asylum seekers generally) misses the point.

Firstly, very few of those who fled Iran seeking asylum return voluntarily
or by compulsion even when their claims are rejected. Secondly, the
respondent's evidence is insufficiently particularised to disclose anything
of relevance to the asserted risk. The respondent's apparent reluctance to
enforce returns to Iran and Iran's policy of refusing to issue laissez-
passers to undocumented Iranian nationals, effectively operate to prevent
the return of the vast majority of failed asylum seekers.

The nature of the Iranian state, the activities of its security forces and
its human rights abuses are described with reference to country guidance
cases, the expert evidence and background materials.

The expert evidence in relation to the impact of recent events on the
assessment of risk is summarised. In addition, the statistics on asylum
applications show a dramatic increase in the rate of asylum claims in the
UK which has roughly doubled over the period when the main Kurdish partisan
groups resumed fighting, from 2014 when there were 2,000 claims to 2016
when there were 4,192. At the very least this must ring alarm bells.

As regards Professor Joff�'s evidence in relation to the PCL, as an
acknowledged expert on Iran he is entitled to draw inferences from what he
has read. He explained that from memory he thought he had read a commentary
to the effect that the PCL effectively reversed the burden of proof for
those accused of political crimes.

As to the respondent's reference to cases in which Professor Joff�'s
evidence had been subject to criticism, in the last 12 years his evidence
has been considered in at least 17 cases reported in the Court of Appeal,
SIAC and the UT, four in the UT being country guidance cases, with no
judicial criticism of his expertise or objectivity. In this case his
evidence was highly consistent with that of Ms Enayat and was not
contradicted by any "body of evidence".

In terms of this appellant's appeal, in her written and oral evidence Ms
Enayat said that the appellant's account was consistent with conditions in
the appellant's home area in 1994.

It is accepted that the evidence does not provide a reasonable basis for
concluding that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Iranian
authorities are already aware of the appellant's sur place activities on
Facebook. However, there are substantial grounds to believe that they would
become aware of those activities during the process of return, either at
the Iranian consulate during the redocumentation process or (more likely)
when questioned at the airport on return. Support for this was to be found
in what was said in SSH and HR at [11] and in AB and Others in terms of
what was said about the 'pinch point'.

Both experts gave unequivocal evidence that the appellant's Facebook
content would put him at risk of persecution if discovered by the Iranian
authorities. The respondent accepts that were it known then the appellant
would be at risk but questions whether he would in fact disclose the
content. However, that question is answered by the preserved finding of the
FtT that he is a genuine believer in Kurdish rights, and by settled
authority to the effect that his claim must be assessed on the basis that
he will, if asked, tell the truth.

In so far as the respondent relies on the unreported decision Secretary of
State for the Home Department v MH, in the first place the Practice
Direction on citation of unreported decisions has not been complied with.
Secondly, the ratio of the decision does not support the contention relied
on in terms of what an individual would actually say when questioned and
thirdly the respondent's position is contrary to the decision of the
Supreme Court in RT (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
[2012] UKSC 38. Fourthly, the situation in MH was different in that the
appellant in that case made an opportunistic attempt to bolster an ill-
founded claim and was not a genuine Christian convert. In this appeal, the
appellant have been found to be a genuine supporter of Kurdish rights.

Both experts agreed that the appellant's long stay in Iraq would be
problematic for him on return, aspects of their evidence being referred to.

On the country guidance issue, Kurdish ethnicity meets the conditions for
being identified as a risk factor in the sense explained in TK (Tamils
- LP updated) Sri Lanka CG [2009] UKAIT 00049.

The appellant's written submissions make suggestions as to the guidance to
be given.
