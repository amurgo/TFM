                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



For the Appellant:     Mr U Aslam, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    FtT Judge Sorrell dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by  a  decision
promulgated on 7 December 2017.  The appellant  was  granted  permission  to
appeal to the UT on 16 January 2018.

2.    It was conceded for the  respondent  that  the  outcome  on  Christian
conversion fell to be reversed.

3.    There are grounds of appeal going also to the political  element,  but
as the outcome would be the same, it is unnecessary to resolve these.

4.    The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside,  and  the
following decision is substituted: the appeal, as brought by  the  appellant
to the FtT, is allowed.

5.    No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
