                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)

                                                                 Respondents


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss L Longhurst-Woods, Counsel, instructed by Moin
                    Afzal Zaigham


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Lea made  on  the  papers  at  Glasgow  on  15th  February  2016.   The
    Appellants are siblings and  say  that  they  are  dependent  on  their
    brother and EEA sister-in-law for  their  essential  needs.  The  judge
    found in the appellants' favour and allowed the appeal.

 2. The Secretary  of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  against  that
    decision on the grounds that insufficient reasons had  been  given  for
    the decision. Permission was subsequently granted by  Designated  Judge
    Woodcraft on 19th July 2016.

 3. Having considered the submissions of both Mr Walker and Miss Longhurst-
    Woods I am satisfied that the judge did not give adequate  reasons  for
    her decision.

 4. The test to be applied is that the appellants have  to  establish  that
    they are dependent upon a union citizen for their essential  needs  and
    that they are in a real situation of dependence vis-ï¿½-vis that citizen.



 5. In a brief determination the judge referred back to a previous decision
    in which Judge Burk had allowed their father's appeal. In effect,  this
    was the basis for her allowing the appeal of the children.

 6. I cannot see from paragraph 12 of her determination how she reaches the
    conclusion that they are in a real situation of dependence.  There  was
    a paucity of evidence before her, simply a statement in an  application
    form and bank statements and evidence of transfer.

 7. It has to be said that the appellants  were  initially  acting  without
    proper legal advice and Miss Longhurst-Woods reasonably submitted  that
    it would be unfair to determine this appeal  without  giving  them  the
    opportunity of providing evidence in the terms  of  witness  statements
    from the appellants and evidence from the EEA sponsor showing transfers
    from her account which can be traced to the Western Union  accounts  of
    the appellants.

 8. The decision is accordingly set aside for inadequate reason and will be
    remade by me  on  a  date  shortly  after  21st  September  2016.   The
    appellants are directed to serve on the Tribunal and the respondent all
    of the evidence on which they intend  to  rely  within  four  weeks  of
    today's date i.e. 14th September 2016.  The respondent  has  a  further
    week to respond.

 9. On 5th September 2016 I received a letter from the sponsor  asking  for
    further time to submit more evidence stating that the  appellants  were
    on holiday in Pakistan and the sponsor was on holiday  in  Poland.   He
    asked for another date to be given in December so that  the  appellants
    could have sufficient time to submit the documentation.  I refused  the
    request since the appellants have already had more then  adequate  time
    to provide all of the evidence upon which they intended to  rely.   The
    original date was to serve the evidence by 14th September 2016.  It  is
    now 29th September 2016.  No further evidence  has  been  supplied  and
    accordingly I am proceeding to deal with this matter  on  the  evidence
    which is before me.

10. In order to succeed in this appeal the appellants  have  to  show  that
    they have been dependent on the sponsor for their  essential  needs  in
    Pakistan.

11. I have received no witness statements from the appellants giving me any
    details of their circumstances in Pakistan. Whilst they assert in their
    application that they are not working they are all adults  and  on  the
    face of it there is no reason why they should not be. Nor is there  any
    information in relation to any other possible sources of  income  other
    than that sent from the UK.

12. Neither do I have any evidence from  the  EEA  national.   The  Western
    Union transfers show the  money  being  sent  from  Moin  Zaigham,  the
    appellant's brother, but there is nothing from her bank accounts  which
    establishes that the dependency originates from  her.   The  fact  that
    they have produced a bank statement is not itself proof  of  dependency
    simply that money is being sent by  their  brother  into  a  particular
    account.

13. In Lim v ECO Manila [2005] EWCA Civ 1383 Elias LJ said at paragraph 29

         "Receipt of support is a necessary but  not  sufficient  condition.
         It is  still  necessary  to  determine  that  a  family  member  is
         dependent in the sense of being  in  need  of  the  assistance.   I
         accept  that  the  authorities  clearly  established  that  it   is
         irrelevant why he or she is dependent, whether because he has given
         his money away or because he is unwilling to  work  (save  possibly
         where an abuse of rights can be established) but  paragraph  62  in
         Pedro does not establish that dependency is determined by the  mere
         fact  that  the  EU  national  makes  resources  available  to  the
         dependent relative."

14. And again at paragraph 32

         "In my judgment the critical question is whether the claimant is in
         fact in a position to support himself or not, and Reyes  now  makes
         that clear beyond doubt in my view.  That is  a  simple  matter  of
         fact.  If he can support himself, there is no dependency,  even  if
         he is given financial material support by the  EU  citizen.   Those
         additional resources are not necessary to enable him  to  meet  his
         basic needs.  If on the other hand he cannot support  himself  from
         his own resources, the court will not ask why  that  is  the  case,
         save perhaps where there is an abuse of rights.  The fact  that  he
         chooses not to get a job and become self-supporting is  irrelevant.
         It follows that on the facts of this case, there was no dependency.
           The  appellant  had  the  funds  to  support  herself.   She  was
         financially independent and did not need the  additional  resources
         for the purpose of meeting her basic needs."

15. In this case the appellants have simply sought to rely  upon  the  fact
    that their brother has transferred money  to  their  bank  accounts  as
    evidence of dependency,  but  that  is  not  sufficient.   Without  the
    further evidence, which has not been forthcoming, the appellants cannot
    establish the fact of their dependency.  Accordingly their appeal  must
    fail.

Notice of Decision

The original judge erred in law and  the  decision  is  set  aside.   It  is
remade as follows.  The appellants' appeals are dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
