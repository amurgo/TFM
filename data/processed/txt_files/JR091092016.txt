                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -


    JUDGE PITT:


 1. This is an application made against a decision dated 15 July 2016 which
    refused further leave as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.


 2. The background to this matter is that the applicant, born in  India  on
    23 June 1980, came to the UK on 16 November 2010 with  entry  clearance
    as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant.  She had leave in that capacity until  4
    April 2016.


 3. On 14 March 2016 Ms Kaur made  an  application  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier  2  (General)  Migrant.   With  that  application  she
    submitted a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) assigned on 11 March 2016.




 4. The CoS was allocated by Astoria Healthcare Limited and was for  a  job
    entitled "Health Service Manager".  It stated that  the  job  type  was
    "1181 Health Services and Public Health Managers and Directors".


 5. The summary of the job description was as follows:


         "Implements policies of the board, ensures statutory procedures are
         followed, with  particular  emphasis  on  patient  safety  and  the
         management  of  risk;  liaises  with  healthcare  professionals  to
         determine  short  and  long  term  needs  and  how  to  meet  these
         objectives within budgetary constraints;  oversees  the  day-to-day
         management of the unit or service and provides leadership to staff;
         oversees the day-to-day management  of  the  unit  or  service  and
         provides leadership  to  staff;  uses  statistical  information  to
         monitor  performance  and  assist  with  planning;  negotiates  and
         manages contracts  with  providers  and  purchasers  of  healthcare
         services;  manages  staff,  including  recruitment,  appraisal  and
         development;  monitors  and  reports  upon  the  effectiveness   of
         services with a view of  improving  the  efficiency  of  healthcare
         provisions;  coordinates  the  promotion  of  public   health   and
         wellbeing in the actions and policies of public agencies and  their
         social partners; monitors and reports  upon  the  state  of  public
         health and wellbeing."


 6. It is common ground that this  section  of  the  CoS  is  in  identical
    wording to the example job  description  for  the  Standard  Occupation
    Classification (SOC) code 1181.


 7. The application for further leave as a Tier 2 Migrant was first refused
    on 18 March 2016. That decision is at  [63]-[76]  of  the  bundle.  The
    application was refused for two reasons.  The first reason is  set  out
    at [64] of the bundle.  It states:


         "You obtained a  qualification  from  Anglia  Ruskin  University  -
         London School of Marketing  which  was  removed  from  the  Tier  4
         Sponsor Register on 5 September 2014.  As  your  qualification  was
         obtained after the date the institution was removed from the Tier 4
         Sponsor Register, the Secretary of State is not satisfied that  you
         meet the requirements specified in the Immigration Rules  in  order
         to be granted leave as a Tier 2 Migrant."


 8. The second reason is set out at [65] of the bundle and states:


         "Your Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) does not provide  sufficient
         information to show that this job is a genuine  vacancy.   On  this
         occasion,  as  we  are  refusing  your  application  on  additional
         grounds,  we  have  not  sought  further  information   about   the
         employment stated on the CoS.  We are  therefore  unable  to  award
         points for sponsorship.  Should a further application be  made  for
         the specific employment, that meets  all  other  Tier  2  criteria;
         additional information would be sought if the CoS did  not  provide
         sufficient information to show that  the  position  was  a  genuine
         vacancy."


 9. On 29 March 2016 the applicant sought  an  administrative  review.  The
    respondent provided a response by way of a further  decision  dated  15
    July 2016, the decision under challenge, at [50]-[59] of the bundle.


10. The decision of 15 July 2016 acknowledged that the refusal on the basis
    of the status of Anglia Ruskin University was erroneous and that reason
    for refusal was no longer relied upon.


11. The respondent still  maintained  that  the  CoS  was  not  sufficient,
    however, indicating, at [52] of the bundle:


         "Your certificate of sponsorship (CoS) does not provide  sufficient
         information to show that this job is a genuine vacancy.


         The occupation codes  listed  in  the  Codes  of  Practice  provide
         guidance and examples of duties that a Tier 2 General Migrant would
         undertake. However, the job description stated on your  CoS  is  an
         exact match to the job description state under SOC code  1181.  The
         job description should provide a genuine vacancy  requiring  skills
         applicable to the job on offer but the job  description  stated  on
         your CoS directly mimics the Tier 2 Immigration Rules  which  leads
         to the conclusion that it is not a genuine vacancy.


         We are therefore unable to award points for sponsorship.  Should  a
         further application be made  for  this  specific  employment,  that
         meets all other Tier 2 criteria; additional  information  would  be
         sought if the CoS did not provide sufficient  information  to  show
         that the position was a genuine vacancy."


12. It is of note that the decision of 15 July  2016  also  stated  on  the
    first page (at [50] of the bundle) that the applicant had the option of
    a further administrative review. The decision repeats that  information
    with more detail on page 4 (at [53] of the bundle).


13. The applicant proceeded to issue this  judicial  review  on  19  August
    2016.  The application was considered  on  the  papers  and  permission
    refused in a decision issued on 10 November 2016.


14. The applicant renewed her application and after an oral hearing  on  13
    January 2017, the Upper Tribunal granted permission in a decision dated
    18 January 2017.  The permission decision indicated that:


         "(iii)   It is arguable that if the respondent imposes a Rule  that
                  certain requirements of the job must be  met,  a  sensible
                  applicant will tailor the job to meet those  requirements.
                  After  all,  if  the   requirements   fall   outside   the
                  requirements the respondent is likely to reject it as non-
                  compliant.  Is the applicant faced between a  rock  and  a
                  hard place?


         (iv) If, however, the draftsman  of  the  application  (arguably  a
                  responsible employer who is well versed in making  similar
                  applications) had made a simple mistake  by  entering  the
                  Standard Occupation  Classification  instead  of  the  job
                  description, might there  not  have  been  a  Sultana  and
                  Others (Rules: waiver/further enquiry; discretion)  [2014]
                  UKUT 00540 (IAC) discretion to raise the  error  with  the
                  applicant?"


15. The applicant's case is essentially as set out in those  paragraphs  of
    the grant of permission.


16. The respondent filed her detailed grounds of  defence  on  15  February
    2017.  The respondent's first ground of defence was a new  matter,  not
    previously raised in the litigation. The respondent submitted that  the
    judicial  review  was  academic  as  the  applicant  had  an   adequate
    alternative remedy by way of a further  administrative  review  of  the
    decision of 15 July 2016.


17. The parties agreed that I should decide this  issue  as  a  preliminary
    matter as, if it was made  out,  the  claim  would  have  to  be  found
    academic.


18. The respondent's  defence  maintained  that  provision  for  a  further
    administrative review arose from the operation of paragraph  34N(2)  of
    the Immigration Rules which states:


         "(2) A further application for administrative review in respect  of
                an eligible decision may be made where the  outcome  of  the
                administrative review is as set out in paragraph AR2.2(d) of
                Appendix AR of these Rules."


    and paragraph AR2.2(d) of Appendix AR to the  Immigration  Rules  which
    identifies an "eligible decision" for a further  administrative  review
    arises where:


         "(d) Administrative  review  does  not  succeed  and  the  eligible
                decision remains in force but with different  or  additional
                reasons to those specified in the decision under review  (my
                emphasis)."


19. The respondent maintained that the decision of 15 July  2016  contained
    both "different" and "additional" reasons to those in the  decision  of
    29 March 2016. As set out in [12] above, the respondent  had  correctly
    identified  in  the  decision  of  15  July   2016   that   a   further
    administrative review was available.  That  mitigated  the  alternative
    remedy argument not being pleaded by the respondent until the  detailed
    grounds of defence dated 15 February 2017. That was not a  sufficiently
    material matter in any event, the principle that the alternative remedy
    issue could be taken even at the substantive hearing being  clear  from
    case law, for example R (Islam) v SSHD [2016] EWHC 2491.


20. The applicant maintained that she did not have the option of a  further
    administrative review against the decision of 15 July 2016 and  so  was
    correct to seek judicial review as the only remedy  available  to  her.
    This was because the reasons given in the decision of 15 July 2016 were
    neither different nor additional.


21. In my judgment, the reasons given by the respondent in the decisions of
    18 March 2016, set out in paragraphs [7]-[8], and those in the decision
    of 15 July 2016, set out in [11] above, clearly show that  the  reasons
    in the second decision were  both  "different"  and  "additional".  The
    withdrawal of the reason for refusal concerning the  status  of  Anglia
    Ruskin University made the decision of 15  July  2016  different.  That
    decision gave additional reasons for  finding  that  the  CoS  did  not
    indicate that there was a genuine vacancy. The decision of 15 July 2016
    was therefore an eligible decision with an  entitlement  to  a  further
    administrative review.  That  is  an  adequate  alternative  remedy  to
    judicial  review  such  that,  following  well-established  public  law
    principles, the application should be refused as academic.


22. The applicant also submitted that the Upper Tribunal had  a  discretion
    to retain the  application  in  special  circumstances  even  where  an
    alternative remedy was available. She relied on  the  Court  of  Appeal
    having done so in the case of Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 424. However,
    at  [28]  of  Khan  the  Court  of  Appeal   identified   the   special
    circumstances that had arisen in that case:


         "28.     If I had been in the Judge's position I would  have  found
                that in the special circumstances of this case it was  right
                to   go   on   to   determine   the   jurisdiction    issue,
                notwithstanding the existence of an alternative remedy.  The
                relevant circumstances are not only that permission had been
                granted and the disappointed expectation and wasted time and
                costs which are the inevitable consequence  if  the  parties
                are then required to pursue a different route. I agree  that
                those   are   not   determinative,   although   they   carry
                considerable weight. But there are the additional  features:
                (a) that permission was granted at an oral hearing, at which
                the  Respondent  was  represented  and  took  no  point   on
                alternative remedy; (b) that the Respondent did not  herself
                take the point at any subsequent stage, it being  raised  by
                the Tribunal for the first time at what was expected  to  be
                the substantive hearing; (c) that the judicial review  route
                followed by the Appellant was one which  had  been  followed
                without demur in several other cases; (d) that  it  was,  to
                put it no higher, uncomfortable to decide the claim  on  the
                basis that the Appellant should have appealed to the FTT  in
                circumstances where her own decision letter asserted that no
                such appeal lay[5]; (e) that  the  proceedings  had  already
                been going on for almost two years without a  decision  even
                as to the correct route of challenge (a delay exacerbated by
                the adjournment in order to  allow  the  alternative  remedy
                point to be explored); and (f) that  it  appeared  that  the
                jurisdiction issue in this case might throw up issues  about
                the reasoning in Basnet which might be of wider  application
                and which it would therefore be useful to have determined at
                UT level. Our attention was not drawn to any  factual  issue
                of a kind which was inappropriate for resolution in judicial
                review proceedings."


23. The circumstances before me are different and not sufficient to  afford
    the  applicant  a  substantive  decision   on   her   judicial   review
    application. The point  was  not  made  first  by  the  Tribunal  at  a
    substantive hearing, some 2 years after the judicial review application
    had been made, as in Khan. Here, the respondent informed the  applicant
    correctly of the remedy of  a  further  administrative  review  in  the
    decision of 15 July 2016. The applicant had further notice of the issue
    in February 2017, some 6 months prior to the substantive hearing,  even
    if it was not raised in  the  acknowledgement  of  service  or  at  the
    permission hearing.


24. Those factors lead me to the conclusion  that  there  are  not  special
    circumstances here such that the Upper  Tribunal  should  exercise  its
    discretion to allow the application to proceed. The applicant's  lawful
    remedy  against  the  decision  of  15  July  2016  is  to  apply   for
    administrative review. If the applicant chooses to pursue  that  option
    where her disagreement with the decision has been found to be  arguable
    by the Upper Tribunal, the respondent will no doubt  wish  to  consider
    the history of this litigation when dealing  with  any  concerns  about
    timeliness.


25. For these reasons the application is refused,





Appeal to Court of Appeal


26. I make a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeal  under  Procedure
    Rule 44(4B) where the applicant has not applied for permission herself.
    The reasoning set out above does not show legal error and so permission
    is refused.


Costs


27. The applicant has  not  been  successful  and  is  liable  to  pay  the
    respondent's reasonable costs. The parties reached an agreement at  the
    hearing on 17  August  2017  that  an  appropriate  assessment  of  the
    respondent's reasonable costs was �1,380 and I make the order for  that
    amount.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
