For the appellant:     Mr A Eaton, instructed by Ata & Co, Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A Tan , Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269), I make an anonymity direction. Unless the Upper  Tribunal  or
a Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the appellant(s).

 1. The appellant has appealed against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Herwald, dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 14.2.19 to refuse  his  application  made  on
    11.10.18 for asylum and humanitarian protection.

 2. Having been granted permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the
    appeal was heard before Upper Tribunal at Manchester. In  the  decision
    promulgated 5.8.19, Judge Chalkley dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal,
    finding the First-tier Tribunal did not err in concluding that,  whilst
    his factual claim was accepted in its entirety, the appellant failed to
    discharge the lower standard of proof to  show  that  he  had  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution on  return  to  Afghanistan,  because,  the
    judge found, he could relocate internally and live safely without fear.



 3. The appellant sought to appeal the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    the Court of Appeal on the basis that, first, Judge Chalkley  erred  in
    failing to considered extant country guidance on the intent  and  reach
    of the Taliban as considered  in  RQ  (Afghan  National  Army,  Hizb-i-
    Islami, Risk) CG [2008] UKAIT 00013. Second, that both  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal erred in omitting  to  consider  up  to
    date country background  material  on  the  rise  in  violence  in  the
    Jalalabad region.

 4. On consideration of the application and pursuant  to  Rule  45  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008,  the  UT  reviewed  the
    decision  in  accordance  Rule  46.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Bruce  was
    concerned that the Country Guidance in RQ may have been  overlooked  in
    relation  to  cases  where  the  Taliban  are  pursuing   a   perceived
    collaborator and where the  issue  of  'double-crossing'  is  relevant,
    giving rise to a country-wide  risk  of  pursuit  by  the  Taliban.  In
    consequence, Judge Bruce wrote to the parties in October 2019  inviting
    submissions as to whether Judge Chalkley's decision should be set aside
    and remade in the Upper Tribunal. On no objection  to  that  course  of
    action being notified to  the  tribunal,  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal was set aside on 5.11.19.

 5. The matter was then relisted before the Upper Tribunal and came  before
    me sitting at Manchester on 16.12.19.

 6. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Eaton suggested that the directions of
    Judge Bruce meant that this was a  continuation  hearing  remaking  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. I disagree. The  decision  of  the
    Upper Tribunal having been set aside, it remains for the Upper Tribunal
    to make a decision on the error of law before addressing any consequent
    remaking of the decision.

 7. The accepted facts in the appellant's protection claim are that he  has
    a well-founded fear of persecution by the Taliban in his home  area  of
    Kabul, for reasons of his political opinion. It  is  accepted  that  in
    2018 the Taliban discovered  that  he  was  working  for  the  American
    Construction Logistics and Services Company (ACLS) and threatened  him.
    He was coerced into co-operating with the Taliban but he betrayed  them
    to the Afghan security services. The  Taliban  subsequently  discovered
    that he had double-crossed them, and threatened to kill him. It follows
    that the sole issue in the  appeal  was  whether  the  appellant  could
    reasonably be expected to relocate elsewhere  within  Afghanistan,  for
    instance to Jalalabad.

 8. The appellant argued that Afghanistan is still  volatile  and  that  it
    would be very difficult for him to travel from Kabul  to  Jalalabad  in
    safety, a distance of some 150 Km through the Nangahar  Province  where
    the Taliban have control. Wherever he went, he would be questioned and,
    it is argued, would soon come to the adverse attention of the  Taliban.
    The respondent argued that Jalalabad remains  under  Afghan  government
    control and with the assisted return  package  of  up  to  ï¿½1,500,  and
    perhaps  with  the  assistance  of  his  uncle  who  helped  him   flee
    Afghanistan, he could make the journey to  Jalalabad,  for  example  by
    travelling by car. It is suggested that he would be at no risk from the
    Taliban in Jalalabad itself.

 9. At [19] of the First-tier Tribunal  decision,  Judge  Herwald  did  not
    accept that the Taliban has power and influence throughout Afghanistan.
    The respondent had suggested relocation to Ghazni or Jalalabad, both of
    which were found to be  outside  Taliban  control.  Judge  Herwald  was
    satisfied that the appellant's uncle would continue to assist him,  and
    also noted the fortitude the appellant had displayed on making his  way
    clandestinely to the UK.

10. The Judge noted that in Januzi [2016] UKHL 5  standard,  the  House  of
    Lords held that, "the question whether it would be unduly harsh  for  a
    claimant to be expected to live in a place  of  relocation  within  the
    country of his nationality is not to be judged by  considering  whether
    the quality of life in the place of relocation meets the basic norms of
    civil, political, and socio-economic human rights...  If  the  claimant
    can live a relatively normal life there judged by  the  standards  that
    prevail in his country of nationality generally, and if  he  can  reach
    the less hostile part without undue hardship or  undue  difficulty,  it
    will not be unreasonable to expect him to move there."

11. The reason the decision of the Upper Tribunal upholding Judge Herwald's
    First-tier Tribunal  decision  was  set  aside  was  that  the  Country
    Guidance of RQ may have been overlooked.  RQ  considered  the  risk  on
    return for a former solider relocation to Kabul.  However,  within  the
    summary of its findings at the beginning of the decision  the  tribunal
    stated:

         "Where there are individual risk factors it is a question  of  fact
         whether the interest in a former soldier is likely to  be  confined
         to his home area or be more widely pursued. In particular, elements
         of 'double cross' in relation to the Taliban or  Hizb-i-Islami,  if
         true, may be sufficient to elevate the pursuit of the appellant and
         the risk to him to such a level that  international  protection  is
         engaged. Where the risk to a particular appellant  is  confined  to
         his  home  area,  internal  relocation  to  Kabul  is  in   general
         available. It would not be unduly harsh to expect an appellant with
         no individual risk factors outside his home area to live  in  Kabul
         and assist in the  rebuilding  of  his  country.  If  an  appellant
         establishes a wider risk, extending beyond the home area,  internal
         relocation  is  not  necessarily  available  and   sufficiency   of
         protection  will  depend  on  his  individual   circumstances   and
         characteristics. In  particular  (a)  internal  relocation  outside
         Kabul is unlikely to provide sufficiency of protection as the areas
         outside Kabul remain under the control of local warlords,  and  the
         population is suspicious  of  strangers;  and  (b)  the  safety  of
         internal relocation to Kabul is a question of  fact  based  on  the
         particular history of an individual appellant and of the warlord or
         faction known to be seeking to harm him."

12. Parts of this decision are clearly now out of date. What is  relied  on
    by the appellant, who was not a soldier, is the reference  to  elements
    of 'double-cross' in relation to the Taliban,  elevating  the  risk  to
    such a level that international protection is engaged.  At  [101]-[102]
    of RQ the Tribunal held,

         "where an individual was 'wanted' by the Taliban or  Hizb-i-Islami,
         then the evidence was that the  situation  in  Afghanistan  remains
         sufficiently lawless that if he were found, there would be  nothing
         to prevent them dealing with him as they thought fit. A person  who
         was wanted in his home area for a specific reason would be able  to
         show a real risk of persecution  (or  treatment  entitling  him  to
         humanitarian protection, as appropriate) in his home area. The next
         question was whether such a person could  relocate  away  from  the
         risk and whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him or  her  to
         do so. Where there was an individual risk, it would be  a  question
         of fact whether internal relocation was an option. In general,  for
         a person with no particular profile, the  Tribunal  had  held  that
         there was no risk in Kabul engaging  the  international  protection
         Conventions (M  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         (Afghanistan) [2004] UKIAT 00035)."

13. The Tribunal went on to hold at [105]  that  outside  Kabul,  enquiries
    would be made about an individual's background and that the rumour mill
    would wish  to  satisfy  itself  as  to  whether  an  incoming  unknown
    individual posed a risk to that community. After considered the Country
    of Origin Information Report for Afghanistan (April  2007)  citing  the
    UNHCR  Update  on  the  Situation  in  Afghanistan  and   International
    Protection Considerations, published June 2005, the Tribunal  concluded
    at [105], "We do not consider that (absent family connections who could
    provide safety in a particular area) internal relocation outside  Kabul
    would be available  to  appellants  with  difficulties  in  their  home
    areas."

14. At [108] the Tribunal stated,

         "Evidence that the appellant would be  personally  pursued  remains
         necessary on the principles set out  in  AF.  Where  such  a  real,
         individual risk is  established,  the  evidence  remains  that  the
         authorities in Kabul are not capable of  individual  protection  to
         the  Horvath  standard  and  that  the  ISAF  is  not  tasked  with
         individual protection  but  rather  with  generalised  peacekeeping
         within Kabul. It  would  always  be  a  question  of  fact  whether
         relocation to a city (in this  case  Kabul)  is  reasonable  or  is
         unduly harsh, both in relation to the conditions  in  the  city  of
         relocation  and  the  individual  history  and  aptitudes  of   the
         particular appellant."

15. At  [109(4)] the Tribunal stated,

             "Where there are individual risk factors it is a  question  of
             fact whether the interest in the ex-soldier is  likely  to  be
             confined to the home  area  or  be  more  widely  pursued.  In
             particular, elements of 'double  cross'  in  relation  to  the
             Taliban or  Hizb-i-Islami,  if  true,  may  be  sufficient  to
             elevate the risk to a level where the international protection
             Conventions are engaged."

16. At the hearing before me, Mr Eaton relied on RQ,  including  the  above
    passages. He also argued that all the case authorities  indicated  that
    the Taliban is now in a stronger position than in 2006-2007, the period
    of evidence considered in RQ. He emphasised that a distinction is to be
    drawn  between  persons  merely  at  risk  from  the  Taliban  such  as
    government collaborators and those who double-cross  the  Taliban,  who
    are at a much higher risk. It was pointed out  that  according  to  the
    appellant's witness statement at [55] to [58] he went to Jalalabad only
    to find his family there terrified that he had brought trouble to  them
    and they were desperate to get him  away  from  them  and  out  of  the
    country. It was suggested that the country background information is to
    the effect that the Taliban are wide-spread in  Nangahar  Province  and
    even in the capital Jalalabad, as set out in the EASO Country  Guidance
    of June 2019, there is an open Taliban presence. Mr Tan also raised the
    question of how the appellant would reach Jalalabad in any event, given
    that all returns are to Kabul, where, it  is  accepted,  the  appellant
    would be at risk.

17. Mr Tan submitted that RQ must be rather out of date and a fact-specific
    assessment must be made. The appellant's evidence was that  he  was  in
    contact with his family in Kabul and yet there  was  no  evidence  that
    they had been approached by the Taliban enquiring after the  appellant.
    It was also suggested that the appellant had  managed  to  travel  from
    Kabul across to Iran, most of the breadth of the country. He has family
    in Jalalabad which remains in government control.

18. Mr Tan also relied on the case of AS (Safety of Kabul) (CG) [2018] UKUT
    118, which the Court of Appeal found to be in error and remitted to the
    Upper Tribunal to be remade, on the basis of an error of computation in
    the Article 15(c) risk in Kabul. Given the narrow ambit  of  the  error
    leading to remittal, the tribunal's assessment of the current risk from
    the Taliban remains persuasive. From [173] of that decision  the  Upper
    Tribunal addressed the risk of persecution by the Taliban in  Kabul  on
    two different bases, either specific targeting or by chance encounter.

19. At [174] the Upper Tribunal found that:

         "The risk of a  specific  individual  being  successfully  targeted
         depends upon their identification as a target (for example, due  to
         past or present  actions/circumstances)  and  the  ability  of  the
         Taliban to locate and then carry out an attack on that  person,  as
         well as their will or priorities in doing  so.   The  evidence  was
         broadly in agreement as to the order of importance of  targets  for
         the Taliban in Afghanistan  being  (i)  senior  serving  government
         officials and the security services, (ii) spies, and at  the  lower
         level, (iii) other  collaborators  (including  the  wider  security
         forces, government authorities, foreign embassies, the UN, NGOs and
         anyone passing information to the government about the Taliban) and
         deserters.  Dr Giustozzi's evidence was that  the  Taliban  keep  a
         blacklist of all those who are wanted by the Taliban/identified  as
         legitimate targets, some of whom are included just because of their
         high-profile position and others at a  lower-level  are  identified
         because they have been through a system of sentencing and only then
         are they a legitimate target.

20.  On the basis  of  insufficient  evidence,  the  Tribunal  rejected  Dr
    Giustozzi's evidence that there was a blacklist, for  the  reasons  set
    out in detail in the succeeding paragraphs of that decision.

21. At [180] the Upper Tribunal stated,

         "The further step required  for  a  person  to  be  identified  and
         targeted is therefore some information about his whereabouts.  That
         would require a person to come to the attention of an informer, but
         even if they did (for example by providing their  details  directly
         to them for the purposes of obtaining a reference for employment or
         accommodation, which for the reasons set out  below  would  not  be
         required in every case), an informer would not have any  access  to
         the list to know that a  person  was  on  it  or  wanted.   At  its
         highest, that informer may tell the Taliban of a person's  details,
         for example as general information given about a person new  to  an
         area,  but  it  is  unclear  as  to  how  such  information   would
         realistically be  relayed  to  a  person  within  the  Taliban  who
         happened to know, from the small number of names that anyone  other
         than a very senior figure within the Taliban is likely to be given,
         that  the  person  they  received  information  about  was  on  the
         blacklist.

         "181. If, in the alternative, for some reason a person came to  the
         direct  attention  of  an  ordinary  Taliban  member  (not  via  an
         informer), again, the possibility that the person's name was one of
         a small number of wanted people thought to be within  that  Taliban
         member's area of operations, or would  reach  a  sufficiently  high
         level within the organisation to have a much larger list of  names,
         is  beyond  remote.   There  is  no  particular  reason  why   such
         information would be checked or passed on higher up  the  chain  of
         command about  someone  about  whom  was  no  immediate  reason  to
         suspect, or potentially only a person of low-level interest.  There
         was no suggestion in the evidence before us that  the  Taliban  had
         the required sophistication, widespread technology or resources  to
         conduct checks on every name of those who come to their  attention,
         via an informer or ordinary  member.   Given  the  vast  population
         movement both internally in Afghanistan and inflow of  people  from
         abroad, the task of  running  basic  identity  checks  against  the
         blacklist system described by Dr Giustozzi would be enormous  -  if
         all were monitored, well over a million people in 2016  alone.   We
         do not find that therefore that there  is  anything  other  than  a
         fanciful risk of identification  as  a  target  for  all  of  these
         reasons.

         "182. Further, even if (which  for  the  reasons  above  is  highly
         unlikely) a person was identified either in their home area  or  in
         Kabul as being on a blacklist (even if that also exists)  and  that
         information was passed  on  to  the  relevant  Taliban  member,  Dr
         Giustozzi's evidence is that there is a single  dedicated  unit  of
         around 20 people operating in Kabul province  tasked  with  hunting
         down and executing targets (albeit we accept that his evidence  was
         of at least one per province and he had not sought  information  as
         to whether there were any more than  one  in  Kabul  or  any  other
         province).  Although his evidence  was  that  low-level  people  of
         interest were pursued because they were easier to successfully kill
         and the number of opponents killed (as opposed to  named  or  high-
         profile targets) is important  within  the  general  objectives  of
         asserting authority as the  legitimate  power  in  Afghanistan  and
         undermining the current government; there would still need to be  a
         decision on the priority of targets amongst a population of 3.5  to
         7 million people, with such limited resources.

          183. The evidence of Mr Siddique recorded in the EASO report  (set
         out above) shows that the list of people for whom the Taliban  will
         invest resources and planning to track and target in  major  cities
         is limited to between a few dozen  to  up  to  a  hundred  persons.
         Further, there is a lack of supporting evidence of targeting of low-
         level individuals in Kabul, cities/urban areas or areas outside  of
         Taliban control (as also found  by  the  European  Court  of  Human
         Rights in H and B v UKï¿½ 70073/10, 44539/11, Chamber Judgment [2013]
         ECHR 298 (9/4/13)).  Overall, this  adds  an  additional  level  of
         remoteness such that in totality, there is insufficient evidence to
         support a real risk  of  a  low-profile  person  being  identified,
         located and targeted even if there is a blacklist  on  which  their
         name appeared.  In the absence of a blacklist at all, that risk  is
         fanciful at most."

22. However, the Upper Tribunal was addressing the risk  in  Kabul.  It  is
    clear that the appellant's home area and location of risk is in  Kabul;
    both parties accept that he cannot reasonably be expected to return  to
    live in Kabul. If he returns, he will be returned to Kabul and have  to
    make his  way  from  there  to  a  place  of  safety  elsewhere  within
    Afghanistan. The respondent's suggestion is that he can go to Jalalabad
    where the government remains in control.

23. However, the respondent's own CPIN dated  July  2019  in  'Afghanistan:
    Security and Humanitarian Situation' acknowledges that there has been a
    deterioration in Afghanistan since AK (Article  15(c))  Afghanistan  CG
    [2012] UKUT 163 (IAC). Mr Eaton's alternative argument is that  on  the
    basis of the  EASO  Country  Guidance  of  June  2019,  the  degree  of
    indiscriminate violence reaches such  a  high  level  in  the  Nangahar
    Province that there is an article 15(C) risk. However, the very passage
    quoted in Mr Eaton's skeleton argument  excepts  the  capital  city  of
    Jalalabad. I am not satisfied that there is any such risk on Jalalabad.



24. Nevertheless, I am not satisfied that the considerations made in AS  as
    to the risk in Kabul necessarily translate to  the  risk  to  a  person
    perceived not just as a collaborator but as a  double-crosser.  On  any
    view, given the undisputed factual background, the appellant must be at
    a higher risk from the Taliban and likely to be specifically  targeted.
    Whether or not he is on a Taliban blacklist, if such exists, may not be
    relevant. It is reasonable to assume that on return to Afghanistan  and
    reaching a place other than his home area, such as Jalalabad,  he  will
    inevitably be the subject of  questioning  and  enquiry.  As  Mr  Eaton
    pointed out, it would not take more than one person in the community to
    relay his details to the Taliban to place him  at  risk  of  his  life.
    Given that the Taliban is openly present in Jalalabad that risk must be
    more than negligible and at least significant  on  the  facts  of  this
    case. The respondent has not provided any cogent argument or  case  law
    to counter the Country Guidance decision of RQ that a double-crosser of
    the Taliban would be personally  pursued.  On  the  whole,  taking  the
    available evidence in the round, I find that the appellant falls within
    the risk category set out in RQ and nothing in AS or AK mitigates  that
    risk. If anything, on the current country background, the risk  may  be
    higher now that it previously was. I am not satisfied that  it  is  any
    less.

25. It follows that I find that there was an error of law in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal in, if not addressing RQ, at  least  in  not
    having sufficient regard to the clearly higher risk as a target of  the
    Taliban the appellant would face on return  to  Afghanistan.  Given  he
    cannot seek safety in Kabul, as many others  could,  he  is  placed  at
    additional difficulty in,  first,  reaching  somewhere  like  Jalalabad
    without coming across the Taliban  and,  second,  living  in  the  city
    which, according to up to date the country background information,  has
    an open presence of the Taliban.

26. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal cannot stand and must  be  set  aside.  Given  the  above
    considerations, the only realistic outcome is to allow the  appeal  for
    the reasons set out above.

Decision

27. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

     I make no fee award.
