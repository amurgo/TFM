Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss P Yong of Divine Law Practice
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Sreeraman, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Jamaica, date of birth  20  October  1981,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated  8  August  2014,  to
    refuse leave to remain and to make removal directions.

2.   The appeal against that decision [D] came  before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Turquet (the judge) who on 30 March 2015 dismissed appeals  under
    the Immigration Rules and in relation to Article 8 ECHR.  Permission to
    appeal that decision was given by First-tier Tribunal Judge Brunnen  on
    3 June 2015.

3.   Ground 1 dealt with the issue of whether or not there was in  effect  a
    material  difference  between  Section  117B(6)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  (NIAA)  2002  and  the  wording  of  the
    Immigration Rules and whether or not the Appellant met the requirements
    in  relation  to  the  eligibility  requirements  under   Appendix   FM
    particularly E-LTRPT2.2-2.4 and 3.1.

4.   The other  grounds  were  not  separately  pursued  before  me;  albeit
    permission had not been refused in respect of those grounds.

5.   It seemed to me the evidence  in  the  case  was  essentially  the  key
    issue.  With reference to paragraph 47 of the judge's  decision  namely
    that the judge had only considered the  requirements  under  E-LTRPT2.4
    the requirements of sole responsibility, access rights  to  the  child,
    evidence they were taking and intended to continue to  take  an  active
    role in the child's upbringing.

6.   The key issues decided by the judge on finding that the  Appellant  did
    not meet the requirements were

         (1)  Appendix FM partner route.  [D45, D49]

         (2)  E-LTRP 1.9. [D45]

         (3)  E-LTRP 2.1. [D46]

         (4)  E-LTRPT 2.4. [D47]

         (5)  Appendix FM EX1. [D47]

         (6)  E-LTRPT 3.1. [D49]

         (7)  Paragraph 276 ADE(iii) (iv) (v). [D50]

         (8)  Family life had not been established A8. [D51] [52]

7.   The judge did not accept as fact the Appellant  was  taking  an  active
    role in the upbringing of K since birth.

8.   The judge's finding that the Appellant had no intention of  caring  for
    K or taking an active role in K's upbringing [D47] or the child M [D49]
    was for the judge to make having heard the evidence.

9.   The judge did not accept the Appellant had enjoyed family life  with  M
    or financially supported M or SBC (mother of M) [D49].   Similarly  the
    judge found the same was so for K or SRit (mother of K) when SRit,  was
    on benefits as a single parent. [D47]

10.  The grounds do not refer to what evidence was lodged by  the  Appellant
    of financial support for K or SRit.  Having  received  the  Appellant's
    documents I can find limited evidence of payment to SRit for K's upkeep
    or her care.

11.  Some bank statements (unidentified) show payments to:-

|SBC      |7/4/14      |�500         |SRit       |2/5/14     |�240       |
|         |6/5/14      |�30          |           |6/5/14     |�10        |
|         |7/5/14      |�10          |           |18/6/14    |�210       |
|         |28/5/14     |�200         |           |3/6/14     |�40        |
|         |25/6/14     |�60          |           |           |           |
|         |7/7/14      |�150         |           |           |           |


12.  Nor  does  the  Appellant  witness  statements  12  March  2015  or  10
    September 2009 assist the Appellant's oral evidence was of paying  SRit
    40-50 weekly.  SBC said in oral evidence she  supported  her  household
    and the Appellant  did  not  give  anything.   In  these  circumstances
    without a proper context for  the  claimed  support  with  intermittent
    payments April to July 2014  to  SRit  for  K  does  not  disclose  any
    material error by the judge in March 2015.

13.  Ground 1 does not disclose any arguable error of law.

14.  The provisions of Section 117B(6) are as follows:

         "In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a qualified child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom."

15.  Miss Yong argued that the Appellant did have a genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a child known as K, a British national,  and  in  the
    circumstances of him living on his own with his mother it could not  be
    regarded as reasonable to expect K to leave the  United  Kingdom.   The
    submissions essentially argued that the  failure  to  consider  Section
    117B(6) was a fundamental error of law when the judge was  supposed  to
    be considering an Article 8 ECHR claim outside of the Rules.

16.  Miss Yong in general terms sought to argue that the  current  situation
    whereby SRit the mother of K and K had no contact  with  the  Appellant
    since January 2015 and the Appellant had not sought  access  to  K  nor
    made an application for a contact order or to the family court in order
    to see and have contact with K.  Within the  Appellant's  papers  there
    are references to a lady called S who the Appellant  married  and  with
    whom he had a step-son MA.  In the submissions and arguments raised  MA
    does not feature as a relevant consideration.  The child MA was born in
    2008 but since that time even by the statement of 10 December 2009, the
    Appellant did not identify any part he played in  MA's  life.   I  have
    taken into account the statement  and  a  handwritten  letter  dated  3
    November 2015 from SRit concerning K's relationship  with  his  father,
    the Appellant.

17.  Ground 2 does not disclose any error  of  law  to  establish  that  the
    Appellant met the requirements of E-LTRPT3.1 nor how  Appendix  FM  EX1
    could be engaged by itself.  The fact the children may be UK  Nationals
    does not assist.

18.  Ground 3

    Does  not  disclose  any  error  in  the  judge's  assessment  of   the
    Appellant's ability to return to Jamaica. [D50]

19.  Ground 4

    The judge was aware the Appellant had worked and  could  speak  English
    and considered  these  matters.  [D65  66  67]  and  decided  that  the
    maintenance of immigration controls  and  other  factors  made  removal
    proportionate and Article 8 ECHR compliant. [D68]

20.  The Appeal before the Original Tribunal related to  removal  directions
    under s.10 IAA 1999.  A form IS151A having been served removal  remains
    and was proportionate.

21.  The Original Tribunal's decisions stand.

    The Appeal is dismissed.

22.  No anonymity direction was made.
