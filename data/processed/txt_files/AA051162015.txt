Representation:
Appellant   Miss Rutherford, Counsel, instructed by Braitch RB
      Solicitors
Respondent  Mr Diwnycz (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Iraq. The appellant entered the United
       Kingdom on November 4, 2003 and claimed asylum on November 6,  2003.
       The respondent refused his asylum claim on December  23,  2003.  The
       appellant  appealed  that  decision  under  section  82(1)  of   the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. His appeal came before
       Adjudicator Prickett and in a decision promulgated on March 18, 2004
       he  refused  the  appellant's  appeal.  The  appellant  was  refused
       permission to appeal that decision and his appeal rights were deemed
       exhausted on August 10, 2004. Between December 2005 and  March  2007
       two  applications  for  a  certificate  of  marriage  approval  were
       refused.

    2. On June 9, 2007 he voluntarily  departed  and  went  to  Jordan.  On
       August 6, 2009 he  applied  for  settlement  as  a  spouse  but  was
       refused. He renewed this application on August 6, 2009 but this  was
       refused on August 23, 2009. He re-applied on September 10, 2009  and
       was given limited leave to enter until April 10, 2012.

    3. On May 5, 2012 he applied for further leave to remain  as  a  spouse
       but this was refused on October 22, 2012. He thereafter applied  for
       asylum on July 23, 2013 but this was refused on March 10, 2015 under
       paragraph 336 HC 395 and a decision was taken to remove him  by  way
       of directions under paragraph 10A of Schedule 2 to  the  Immigration
       Act 1971.

    4. The appellant appealed that decision  under  section  82(1)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on March 24, 2015.

    5. The appeal came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Hubball  on
       June 19, 2015 and in a decision  promulgated  on  July  6,  2015  he
       refused the appellant's appeal on all grounds.

    6. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on July 20,  2015  submitting
       the First-tier Judge had erred in his approach  to  the  appellant's
       claim and the assessment of risk generally.

    7. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fisher gave permission to appeal on
       basis the Judge may have erred.

    8. In a Rule 24 letter dated August 11, 2015 the respondent opposed the
       appeal. She argued the Judge reached findings open to him  based  on
       the earlier findings of Adjudicator Prickett and given  the  country
       material the Judge was entitled to conclude he could safely return.

    9. The matter came before me on the above date and I heard  submissions
       from both representatives.

   10. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity direction and pursuant  to
       Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  I
       extend that order.



SUBMISSIONS

   11.  Miss  Rutherford  submitted  the  grounds  were  connected  because
       findings on family issues were  relevant  to  risk  on  return.  She
       accepted that both today and at the earlier hearing she accepted the
       facts of his asylum claim had not changed between the decision  from
       March 2004 and the current day save he maintained  he  was  of  Arab
       ethnicity and the Judge had failed to address this in his  decision.
       Adjudicator Prickett had not addressed this  issue  in  the  earlier
       decision and the Judge's failure to do so amounted to  an  error  in
       law. She further submitted that  the  appellant  stated  he  had  no
       contact with his family and he was being asked to  provide  evidence
       to prove a negative. This was wrong in law. These errors contributed
       to the third error namely that the judge should have  departed  from
       the country guidance  decision  of  MK  (documents-relocation)  Iraq
       [2012] UKUT 00126 (IAC) in light of the recent evidence contained in
       the respondent's own reports. The Judge had also  not  engaged  with
       the expert report of Ms Guest and  had  failed  to  properly  assess
       risk.

   12. Mr Diwnycz relied on the rule 24 response and submitted the facts of
       the appellant's claim  remained  unchanged  and  there  was  no  new
       evidence to support his claimed ethnicity. These were  matters  that
       were placed before the original  Adjudicator  and  he  rejected  his
       claims. There was no error either on  this  issue  or  his  findings
       about the appellant's family. The Judge had considered his  evidence
       and given sufficient reasons to explain his conclusions.  They  were
       open to him and the fact the appellant did not  like  them  did  not
       amount to an error in law. As for the third  ground  of  appeal  the
       Judge noted  the  expert  report  was  prepared  on  the  basis  the
       appellant's  account  was  accepted  and  accepting  everything  the
       appellant claimed but his claim  had  been  rejected.  Her  findings
       would have carried limited weight in  those  circumstances  and  the
       Judge  had  properly  considered  the  more  recent  evidence   from
       paragraph [95] onwards and concluded the appellant would not  be  at
       risk. There was no error in law.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   13. Three areas were raised by Miss Rutherford. Two were factual  issues
       and one related to risk on return.

   14. Miss Rutherford acknowledged both  before  me  and  at  the  hearing
       before the First-tier Tribunal that the  facts  of  the  appellant's
       claim remained unchanged. She accepted  Adjudicator  Prickett  found
       the appellant not to  be  a  credible  witness  and  had  completely
       rejected  his  account  of  events.  He  had   identified   numerous
       discrepancies  and  he  concluded,  based  on  the  appellant's  own
       evidence, the appellant was a Kurd  who  went  to  school  in  Mosul
       before going to live with his uncles in Duhok.

   15. The Judge found he was a Kurd and that he was  a  Sunni  Muslim  and
       gave reason for this in paragraph [90]  of  his  decision.  He  also
       found the appellant was determined to remain here  and  changed  his
       evidence to enable him to try and remain and this finding, based  on
       his own conclusions and those of Adjudicator Prickett, were  clearly
       open to him.

   16. Nothing had changed, by Miss Rutherford's own admission,  from  when
       the Adjudicator last heard his appeal. Everything he  told  him  was
       repeated to the Judge and there is nothing in the  Judge's  decision
       that raised a factual error.

   17. Those findings were then formed part of the Judge's consideration of
       risk on return. The Judge referred not only to the expert report but
       also referred to the country evidence at paragraph [99].  The  Judge
       also had regard to  security  issues  in  paragraph  [97].  He  then
       considered the position if he  were  returned  to  the  KRG  and  at
       paragraphs [100] and [101] he gave reasons for finding he  could  be
       returned safely. The Judge reminded himself of the  decision  of  HM
       and others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00409 (IAC) which was
       the country guidance case at the time.  His  findings  were  clearly
       open to him and nothing contained in the respondent's refusal letter
       places him at risk.

   18. I therefore find there has been no error in law.

DECISION

   19. The making of the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
       involve the making of an error on a point of law. I uphold the First-
       tier decision.
