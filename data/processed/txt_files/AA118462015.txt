                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge H. Clark promulgated on the 21st June  2016,  in  which
      she dismissed the Appellant's protection and Human Rights appeals.

   Background

   2. The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan.  His age was in dispute  at
      the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  At that time the  Appellant  claimed
      to be 16 years old, but the Respondent relied upon an  age  assessment
      which has concluded that the Appellant was 18 years and 5 months  old.
      It is the Appellant's case that were he to be returned to Afghanistan,
      his life would be at risk because the Taliban  want  to  recruit  him.
      The Appellant had appealed against the Respondent's decision dated the
      27th August 2015 in which his asylum claim was rejected.

   3. The Appellant's appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge H.  Clark
      in the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House  on  the  25th  May
      2016.  Judge Clark in her decision, preferred the conclusions  of  the
      age assessment  conducted  on  the  Appellant  in  March  2015,  which
      concluded that he was aged 17 at the time, which would have  made  him
      18 years old and 5 months as at the date  of  the  decision  by  Judge
      Clark, to the Appellant's evidence and the evidence  given  by  the  3
      adult members of his cricket team.  She therefore concluded  that  the
      Appellant was no longer a minor for the purposes  of  considering  his
      appeal, but she did accept the Appellant's account of his father's and
      his brother's deaths and that  the  Appellant  was  from  the  Pashtun
      community and fitted  the  profile  of  Taliban  recruits  [59].   She
      therefore accepted that the Appellant's account of his brother's death
      and that the warning left on his body to the Appellant was  reasonably
      likely to have occurred, and that if the Appellant were to  return  to
      his home village he would be at risk of forcible recruitment or  death
      if he resisted.  However,  Judge  Clark  went  on  to  find  that  the
      Appellant could reasonably relocate to Kabul in safety and access  the
      sort of living standard which generally prevails in  Afghanistan  [64]
      and that the Appellant would have sufficiency of protection in  Kabul.
      She therefore refused his asylum claim. She  also  found  his  removal
      would not be a breach of his Human Rights.

   Grounds of Appeal

   4. The Appellant has now sought to appeal that decision for  the  reasons
      set out within the Grounds of Appeal.

   5. Within the Grounds of Appeal 4 grounds  of  appeal  are  relied  upon.
      Firstly, it is argued that the Judge had failed to take account of the
      Appellant's own evidence regarding his age and that the  Appellant  in
      his statement dated the 17th June 2015 had stated that:

           "Although I don't know the month of my birth, I believe  that  I
           am now 15 based on what my mother told me.  She told  me  I  had
           just turned 14 when I left.  I travelled for 3� months and  have
           been here for almost 10 months.  In  Afghanistan,  every  spring
           the new year comes and people count the years in  that  way.   I
           believe my mum definitely knew how to count the years.  We  were
           farmers.  We know it is spring because people  are  starting  to
           grow wheat."

      However it  is  said  that  Judge  Clark  mis-stated  the  Appellant's
      evidence regarding his age and that Judge Clark at [48] found that:

           "The Appellant's own evidence as to his age  is  unsatisfactory,
           because it is based purely on what he was  told  by  his  mother
           immediately before he left Afghanistan.  He,  quite  reasonably,
           has no way of knowing the basis for his mother's  conclusion  as
           to his age.  He has explained that birthdays are not  celebrated
           in Afghanistan and his mother could not read or  write,  so  her
           assessment necessarily relied on memory alone.  The  Appellant's
           general credibility is of no particular  relevance  to  the  age
           assessment, since all he can do is rely on what he was  told  by
           his mother.  There is no way of knowing what he was  told  about
           his age was accurate, or even thought  to  be  accurate  by  his
           mother."

      It is argued that the Appellant believed his mother knew  his  age  by
      reference to the onset of spring and that  the  Judge  has  mistakenly
      believed that due to her illiteracy the Appellant's mother would  have
      had no point of reference against which  to  measure  the  Appellant's
      age.

   6. Within the second ground of appeal it is argued that the Judge  failed
      to take account of  relevant  factors  and  that  although  the  Judge
      accepted that the risks facing children do not necessarily cease  upon
      them attaining majority, it is argued that apparent or assumed age  is
      more important that chronological age and that  the  Judge  failed  to
      take into account the Appellant's evidence regarding the  difficulties
      he would face with living  independently  and  that  when  considering
      whether or not the Appellant could safely internally  relocate  within
      Afghanistan, the Judge failed to take into accounts  factors  such  as
      the fact that the Appellant remained  under  the  care  of  the  Local
      Authority, did not live independently, gave evidence of limited  self-
      help skills, and that 3 witnesses provided examples of his immaturity.



   7.  Within the third ground  of  appeal  it  is  argued  that  the  Judge
      erroneously treated the  absence  of  risk  as  determinative  of  the
      assessment of whether internal relocation was reasonable at  [60]  and
      [64] of the decision.  In the fourth ground of  appeal  it  is  argued
      that at [64] the Judge had said that the Appellant would  be  able  to
      establish  himself  with  the  assistance  of  a  returnee  assistance
      programme in Afghanistan, which  would  provide  him  with  help  with
      setting up a business or finding work or short-term accommodation, but
      that the Judge had not identified the evidence upon which this finding
      was based and that that evidence did  not  sit  with  the  Appellant's
      immaturity and lack of independent living skills and the fact that the
      Judge herself had found that the 2016 Refugee Support Network Research
      concerning outcomes for returnees to Kabul suggested  the  Appellant's
      employment prospects would be precarious.

   8. Permission to appeal has been granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Landes on the 13th July 2016, when she found that it was arguable that
      the Judge had erred in her approach to internal relocation and that it
      was arguable that the Judge had not explained why the Appellant  would
      be able  to  access  the  sort  of  living  standard  which  generally
      prevailed in Afghanistan, given her  reference  to  the  2016  Refugee
      Support Network Research indication that  the  Appellant's  employment
      prospects as a returnee would be precarious. She further found that it
      was arguable that the Judge had considered internal relocation  simply
      in light of whether the Appellant would be at risk of  persecution  or
      treatment contrary to Article 3 in Kabul.  Judge  Landes  went  on  to
      state that although she did not limit  permission,  she  did  consider
      there to be less to the other Grounds of Appeal and that although  the
      Judge did not specifically identify the evidence upon which  she  came
      to the conclusion about the returnee assistance programme,  there  was
      similar  evidence  in  the  "After  Return"  report  produced  by  the
      Appellant at B125, where support for forced returnees provided by  IOM
      was described.  She found that as far as ground 2 was concerned it was
      difficult  to  see  the  Judge  had  erred  in  her  approach  to   KA
      (Afghanistan), given that apparent age is based on maturity, in  terms
      of behaviour as well as appearance and that the Judge's findings  were
      to the effect the Appellant's apparent age was 18 and  that  he  would
      present to others as an adult.  Judge Landes further  found  that  she
      saw no reason for considering the Judge had arguably  overlooked  what
      the Appellant had said in his witness  statement  and  the  Judge  had
      referenced his statement and that the evidence  contained  within  the
      first paragraph of that statement and that even the Appellant's mother
      counted years by reference to the onset of spring, and that assessment
      of the year the Appellant was born would still be by reference to  her
      memory given that birthdays were not celebrated in Afghanistan.

   9. Within the Rule 24 Reply from the Respondent dated the 25th July 2016,
      it is argued, inter alia, that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  directed
      herself appropriately and that the Grounds of Appeal hold little merit
      on the maturity point.  It is argued that the Judge had  made  lengthy
      findings, assessing a wealth of material,  when  considering  internal
      relocation and the Judge had assessed the current case law  and  found
      that it was reasonable for the Appellant to return to Kabul  and  that
      there was no material error of law.

  10. In the Appellant's Skeleton Argument dated the 5th August 2016, it  is
      argued, inter alia, that the Appellant is still involved in a judicial
      review proceeding in respect of his assessed date of birth and that he
      had been granted permission at an oral hearing for the judicial review
      on the 9th June 2016 by His Honour Judge Keyser QC on the ground  that
      it was arguable that the Upper Tribunal may reach a different decision
      as to age upon undertaking a new fact finding exercise, but  there  is
      no date for the hearing  as  yet.   It  was  then  argued  within  the
      Skeleton Argument  that  the  correct  test  in  respect  of  internal
      relocation as to whether it would be reasonable or  unduly  harsh  for
      the Appellant to relocate  and  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      applied too high a test when considering whether the  Appellant  would
      face persecution in Kabul and that in light of the  Appellant's  young
      age, lack of  connections,  family  support  and  detailed  levels  of
      hardship  mentioned  within  the  "After   Return:   documenting   the
      experience of young people forcibly  removed  to  Afghanistan"  report
      from April 2016, it is argued that had Judge Clark applied the correct
      legal test,  only  a  different  decision  could  have  been  reached.
      Reference is then made to the contents of the "After Return" report in
      respect of returnees having employment prospects and how employment is
      a significantly growing challenge for the  population  of  Afghanistan
      and how the IOM provides only small amounts of cash for onward  travel
      to  another  province,  2  weeks'  accommodation,  and   reintegration
      assistance up the value of �750 for setting up a business or  �900  to
      cover the cost of training or education, but  that  obtaining  such  a
      reintegration package is difficult  and  individuals  had  to  provide
      documentation demonstrating the viability of  the  business  and  that
      young people struggled  to  find  or  sustain  work  as  a  result  of
      experience and  discrimination  against  returnees  and  how  spending
      formative years outside Afghanistan disrupted the formation of natural
      connections within the Afghan society.  It was argued  as  a  returnee
      without family assistance the Appellant would not be  able  to  access
      the sort of living standards general prevailing in Afghanistan.

   Oral Submissions

  11. It was on that basis the case came before me in  the  Upper  Tribunal.
      In his oral submissions, Mr Smyth relied upon  his  Skeleton  Argument
      and the Grounds of Appeal, and argued  that  there  was  a  reasonable
      likelihood that the Appellant was the age he says and that  the  Judge
      had failed to take account of his own evidence and that it had  to  be
      borne in mind the Judge had found  the  Appellant  to  be  a  credible
      witness and that his mother did know how to count the  years  as  they
      grew wheat and the Judge had not taken account of that.

  12.  He then argued that First-tier Tribunal Judge Clark  had  essentially
      treated  the  risk  of  persecution  and  harm  in  Kabul   as   being
      determinative of the Appellant's ability to internally  relocate,  and
      that the Judge had applied the wrong legal test in respect of internal
      relocation at [64].  He argued that the  finding  that  the  Appellant
      would be able to access the  same  living  standards  as  the  general
      population in Afghanistan was perverse, given that he  had  no  family
      ties in Kabul.  He argued that the final ground of appeal tied in with
      the third ground of appeal and was not truly  a  separate  ground  but
      went to the deficiency of reasons given  by  the  Judge  in  terms  of
      accessing support.

  13. In her submissions on behalf of the Respondent, Mrs Ahmad argued  that
      the Judge had given detailed reasons as to why the Appellant  appeared
      to be over 18 years old and the  Judge  referred  to  the  Appellant's
      evidence at [48] and as to why she gave limited weight to the evidence
      supporting the Appellant's claimed age and that she  was  entitled  to
      make the findings that  she  did.   She  argued  that  the  Judge  had
      properly considered the age assessment report.

  14. Mrs Ahmad argued that in considering internal  relocation,  the  Judge
      had properly considered the case and  that  the  Judge  had  not  only
      considered risk upon return but had taken a number  of  other  factors
      into account at [64] and the financial and other assistance available.
       She  argued  that  the  Respondent's  position  on  assistance  being
      available was set out within paragraph  77  of  the  original  refusal
      letter.  She argued that following the case of Muse and Others v Entry
      Clearance Officer [2012] EWCA Civ 10, that brevity and succinctness of
      reasons were permissible and that the reasons  given  needed  only  to
      refer to the main issues in dispute, not every material consideration.



   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

  15. I do not accept the submission  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      failed to take account of the Appellant's own evidence in  respect  of
      his age.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Clark at [7]  fully  set  out  the
      documents which she  had  considered  in  the  appeal,  including  the
      statements from the Appellant himself, including the witness statement
      dated the 17th June 2015 by him.  When we looked  at  that  statement,
      the Appellant's evidence as to how he  believed  his  mum  would  have
      known his age is clearly set out, and the Judge at [48] had considered
      that evidence, but found it to be unsatisfactory, because it was based
      upon purely on what he had been told his mother immediately before  he
      left Afghanistan.  Although the Judge found "He, quite reasonably, has
      no way of knowing the basis for his mother's conclusion as to his age.
       He has explained that birthdays are not  celebrated  in  Afghanistan,
      his mother could not read  or  write  so  her  assessment  necessarily
      relied upon her memory alone", that finding is not undermined  by  the
      Appellant's evidence that they were farmers and that his mother  would
      have been able to count the years by reference to the onset of spring,
      given that even in such circumstances, her recollection would still be
      based upon his mother's memory, in circumstances where birthdays  were
      not celebrated. I find that the Judge had properly taken into  account
      the evidence of the Appellant in this  regard,  and  in  reaching  her
      conclusions as to age.

  16. She has also taken account of the evidence of his witnesses  from  the
      cricket  team  at  [46],  but  had  concluded  that  those  witnesses'
      observations  were  largely  limited   to   the   Appellant's   social
      interactions in the context of the cricket team and  that  "They  have
      had  no  opportunity,  for  instance,  to   assess   the   Appellant's
      independent living and self-care skills against those of the 15 and 16
      year olds with whom  they  are  comparing  him,  or  to  consider  the
      Appellant's age in the context of his  own  account  of  his  life  in
      Afghanistan or journey to  the  UK".   The  Judge  had  also  properly
      considered the Merton compliant  age  assessment  conducted  in  March
      2015, and gave full, adequate and sufficient  reasons  for  preferring
      that  evidence.   I  therefore  do  not  accept  that  the  Judge  has
      materially erred in respect of her analysis of the Appellant's age.

  17. In respect of the second ground of appeal the age assessment itself is
      based upon an assessment as to the likely age of the  Appellant  based
      upon his maturity and how he presents himself, given that there is  no
      documentary proof as to his age.   The  age  assessment  is  therefore
      based upon his apparent age, rather than documents proving his  actual
      age and therefore, in relying upon the age assessment, Judge Clark has
      not confused apparent or assumed age with maturity,  and  she  has  in
      considering  the  Appellant's  age,  at  [43]  clearly  set  out   the
      Appellant's own evidence that "However, the Appellant  does  not  feel
      ready to live an independent life".  She had therefore  taken  account
      of the Appellant's evidence in that regard, and although she  may  not
      have fully set out the entirety of that evidence, it is not  necessary
      for the Judge to set out the entirety of the evidence on the point, if
      the Judge has clearly had that evidence in mind, and taken account  of
      the same in reaching her conclusions.  I do not consider there was any
      material  error  in  that  regard.  I  find  she  has  adequately  and
      sufficiently explained her reasons and that her findings were open  to
      her on the evidence.

  18. In respect of the third ground of appeal it is argued that the  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge had treated the absence of risk  as  determinative
      of the assessment as to whether internal  relocation  was  reasonable,
      (or not unduly harsh) or taken all of the circumstances pertaining  to
      the Appellant into account, following the case of Junuzi  v  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department and Others [2006] UKHL 5. Clearly, as
      part of the assessment of internal relocation, the Judge does have  to
      consider whether or not the Appellant would be at a real risk  in  the
      area where it is proposed that  he  could  internally  relocate.   The
      Judge therefore did have to consider the risk of forced recruitment by
      the Taliban, were the Appellant to relocate to Kabul, as she has  done
      at [60] and, she has quite properly gone on to  consider  the  general
      risk to civilians in Afghanistan and Kabul at  [61],  [62]  and  [63].
      However, she has not treated that as determinative of the question  as
      to whether or not it was reasonable for the Appellant to  relocate  to
      Kabul and at [63] and [64] she specifically noted that  there  was  no
      bright line across which of the risks  to  and  of  a  child  suddenly
      disappear, but did note the Appellant did present, in light of the age
      assessment as being over 18 years old.

  19.  She further took into account that the Appellant would not  have  any
      family support upon return to Afghanistan, but that he  did  not  have
      such support in the United Kingdom either.  She further  at  [64]  did
      take account of the availability of a returnee assistance programme in
      Afghanistan which would help provide him with setting up a business or
      finding work or short-term accommodation.  Although the Judge has  not
      specifically mentioned the  "After  Return"  report  provided  by  the
      Appellant, given her reference to the returnee  assistance  programme,
      she has clearly taken that evidence into account given  her  reference
      to there being a returnee assistance programme.

  20.  Although complaint is made by the Appellant in terms of the fact that
      the "After Return" report  indicates  that  support  given  to  forced
      returnees is limited, in terms of accommodation  only  being  provided
      for a couple of weeks, and only �750  being  provided  for  assistance
      with setting up a new business, but that there  were  difficulties  in
      often accessing such support, in that one would have to establish  the
      viability  of  the  new  business,  the  fact  that  there  would   be
      difficulties in accessing such support does not mean that such support
      is not available, the Judge was quite right to indicate the  existence
      of such a programme, and it was open to the Judge  to  find  that  the
      Appellant would be able to establish himself with  the  assistance  of
      such a returnee assistance programme in providing help with setting up
      a business and short-term accommodation.

  21. The Judge had also taken account of the fact  that  the  2016  Refugee
      Support Network had indicated that his employment prospects  would  be
      precarious and that he would be  unlikely  to  continue  any  sort  of
      education and,  as  stated  earlier,  the  Judge  had  considered  the
      Appellant's own evidence that he did not  consider  himself  ready  to
      live independently, and the Judge had therefore taken account  of  all
      of the relevant considerations, and in my judgement, the finding  that
      the Appellant would be able to establish himself with  the  assistance
      of the returnee assistance programme and he would be  able  to  access
      the sort of living standard which generally prevails  in  Afghanistan,
      was a finding that was open to her on  the  evidence,  and  is  not  a
      finding which is "perverse" as argued by Mr Smyth on  the  Appellant's
      behalf.  I do not consider that the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Clark contains any material error of  law  in  this  regard.   I
      further  do  consider  that  her  findings  and  reasoning  has   been
      adequately and sufficiently explained.  I therefore  do  not  consider
      that there is any merit in  either  the  third  or  fourth  ground  of
      appeal.

  22. In such circumstances, the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  H.
      Clark does not reveal any material error of law and is maintained. The
      Appellant's appeal against her decision is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge H.  Clark  does  not  contain  any
material error of law and is maintained.

First-tier Tribunal Judge Clark did not make any anonymity order, and  there
was no application for an anonymity order before me.   I  therefore  do  not
make any anonymity order in this case.
