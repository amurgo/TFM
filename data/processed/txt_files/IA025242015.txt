For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss M Hannan, Corban Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the Secretary of State's appeal  but  we  shall  refer  to  the
    parties as in the First-tier Tribunal. The Appellant's  appeal  against
    the refusal of a residence card  was  allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Colyer on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  was  entitled  to  a
    permanent residence card under Regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations.

2.   It was agreed by the parties that the judge had erred  in  law  because
    the Appellant had not  been  residing  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    continuous period of five years.

3.   We therefore set aside paragraph 37 of  the  decision.   There  was  no
    error in relation to the judge's findings under Regulations 6 and 7 and
    those were not challenged by the Respondent in this appeal.

4.   We accordingly remake the decision.   The  Appellant  has  a  right  of
    residence under Regulation  14(2)  of  the  EEA  Regulations  2006  and
    therefore the appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations 2006.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.

The Appellant's appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations 2006.

No anonymity direction is made.
