Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Seelhoff, Solicitor, A Seelhoff Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent, (hereinafter "the claimant") is a national of  Portugal
    and hence an EEA national.  He came to the  United  Kingdom  in  August
    2001 and entered employment  soon  after.   On  27  June  2012  he  was
    sentenced to four years' imprisonment for causing  death  by  dangerous
    driving  and  twelve  months  (concurrent)  for  knowingly  causing   a
    recording of false data relating to his lorry tachograph.   The  victim
    was an elderly woman.  This conviction came on top of another  incident
    in February 2009 when a cyclist went under the wheels of his lorry  and
    died for which he received three points on his licence and a �200 fine.
     On 24 February 2014 the respondent decided to make a deportation order
    against him under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
    2006 (hereafter the "2006 EEA Regulations").  His appeal  against  that
    decision came before a First-tier Tribunal panel (Judge Talbot and Non-
    Legal Member S E Singer).  In a decision sent on 22 September 2014 they
    allowed his appeal.  The claimant had completed his prison sentence  on
    22 July 2014.

2.   The panel  noted  that  comprehensive  documentary  evidence  had  been
    produced to show that the claimant had been in continuous employment in
    the  UK  for  over  ten  years  prior  to  the  respondent's  decision.
    Accordingly, it considered that the claimant could only be deported, if
    there were "imperative grounds of public policy" for deporting him.

3.   Article 28 of ECO/2004/38 (the Citizens Directive)  and  Regulation  21
    of the 2006 EEA Regulations provide as follows:-

         Article 28:  Protection against expulsion

         (1)  Before taking an  expulsion  decision  on  grounds  of  public
             policy or public security, the host Member  State  shall  take
             account of considerations such  as  how  long  the  individual
             concerned has resided on its territory, his/her age, state  of
             health, family and economic  situation,  social  and  cultural
             integration into the host  Member  State  and  the  extent  of
             his/her links with the country of origin.


         (2)  The host Member State  may  not  take  an  expulsion  decision
             against Union citizens or their family  members,  irrespective
             of nationality, who have the right of permanent  residence  on
             its territory, except on serious grounds of public  policy  or
             public security.


         (3)  An expulsion decision may not be taken against Union citizens,
             except if the decision  is  based  on  imperative  grounds  of
             public security, as defined by Member States, if they:


             (a)  have resided in the host Member State  for  the  previous
                  ten years; or


             (b)  are a minor, except if the expulsion is necessary for the
                  best interests of the child, as provided for in the United
                  Nations Convention on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  of  20
                  November 1989.


         Regulation 21:Decisions taken on public policy, public security and
         public health grounds

             (1)  In this regulation a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
                  decision taken on the grounds  of  public  policy,  public
                  security or public health.


             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
                  ends.


             (3)  A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
                  person  with  a  permanent  right   of   residence   under
                  regulation 15 except on serious grounds of  public  policy
                  or public security.


             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
                  grounds of public security in respect of an  EEA  national
                  who-


                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                      period of at least ten years prior  to  the  relevant
                      decision; or


                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                      is necessary in his best interests, as  provided  for
                      in the Convention on the Rights of the Child  adopted
                      by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20th
                      November 1989.


              (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds  of  public
                  policy or  public  security  it  shall,  in  addition  to
                  complying  with  the   preceding   paragraphs   of   this
                  regulation, be taken in  accordance  with  the  following
                  principles-


                  (a)  the decision must comply with the principle of
                      proportionality;


                  (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the
                      personal conduct of the person concerned;


                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person concerned must
                      represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
                      threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of
                      society;


                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case or
                      which relate to considerations of general prevention
                      do not justify the decision;


                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions do not in
                      themselves justify the decision.


             (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of
                  public policy or public security in relation to a person
                  who is resident in the United Kingdom the decision maker
                  must take account of considerations such as the age, state
                  of health, family and economic situation of the person,
                  the person's length of residence in the United Kingdom,
                  the person's social and cultural integration into the
                  United Kingdom and the extent of the person's links with
                  his country of origin."


4.   The appellant's (hereafter "the  Secretary  of  State's"  or  "SSHD's")
    grounds of appeal challenged the panel's decision on two  main  counts.
    First, it was contended that it  had  erred  in  considering  that  the
    claimant was entitled to the highest level of  protection  ("imperative
    grounds of public policy").  In this regard  it  was  argued  that  the
    panel should have applied the binding authority of the Court of Justice
    rulings in C-400/12 Secretary of State v MG as elaborated by the  Upper
    Tribunal in MG [2014] UKUT 392 (IAC) and  in  calculating  whether  the
    claimant had the requisite ten years' continuous  residence  it  should
    have found that he did not because that period had been broken  by  his
    period of imprisonment.  This, together with  his  involvement  in  two
    fatal accidents and disregard of the court in 2009,  demonstrated  that
    he had not integrated into the UK and had no respect for  the  laws  of
    the UK.  As a result the claimant could  only  be  considered  to  have
    accrued residence afresh since 2012 and  as  a  result  the  SSHD  only
    needed to show that there were grounds of public policy  for  deporting
    him.

5.   Secondly, it was submitted that even in the  event  that  the  claimant
    had acquired  ten  years'  continuous  residence  the  panel  erred  in
    declining to find that there were imperative grounds of  public  policy
    because the claimant had caused  two  fatalities  and  the  second  was
    caused solely  through  the  claimant's  disregard  for  the  condition
    imposed on him to wear glasses while driving.   The  claimant  had  not
    learnt from his causing a fatal accident in 2009  and  had  caused  the
    death of a second innocent pedestrian.  The claimant, it was submitted,
    was a dangerous offender, a present, genuine and  sufficiently  serious
    threat and there were imperative grounds of  public  policy  to  deport
    him.

6.   In amplifying the grounds Mr Melvin upbraided the  First-tier  Tribunal
    panel  for  dealing  very  cursorily  with  the  issue  of  ten  years'
    continuous residence and for applying the wrong standard of protection.
     He submitted that the claimant had given evidence in Portuguese, which
    added to the other factors pointing against integration.

7.   Mr Melvin was asked  to  clarify  whether  it  was  accepted  that  the
    claimant had accrued ten years as a worker before  he  was  imprisoned.
    Mr Melvin said that the SSHD had not  challenged  the  finding  of  the
    panel to that effect but factually it seemed to him that  the  claimant
    only began employment in 2003 and the sentence was passed in 2011.   Mr
    Melvin was also asked to clarify why he was  now  submitting  that  the
    claimant should have been assessed by reference to the lowest  standard
    of protection when even the SSHD's decision  letter  had  accepted  the
    relevant standard was "serious grounds of public policy".  He  said  he
    left that as a matter for the Tribunal.

8.   The SSHD's basic point, submitted Mr Melvin, was  that  the  panel  had
    erred by failing to consider whether the claimant's ten year period  of
    residence had been broken by his period of imprisonment.

9.   Mr Seelhoff for the claimant urged the Upper Tribunal  not  to  re-open
    matters unchallenged by the SSHD in her grounds of appeal.   There  was
    evidence before the panel  to  show  that  the  claimant  had  been  in
    employment since 2001.  The whole family had given evidence  and  there
    was no dispute about the facts prior to Mr Melvin  seeking  to  re-open
    them at this hearing.   Asked  what  response  he  had  to  the  SSHD's
    contention that the First-tier Tribunal panel had erred in  failing  to
    consider whether prison broke the claimant's continuity  of  residence,
    Mr Seelhoff said it was implicit in its conclusion that the  panel  was
    satisfied the claimant had retained integrative links,  notwithstanding
    his imprisonment.  There was no evidence he had lost such  links.   His
    family had visited him in prison.  He was no danger to the  public  now
    as he had lost his licence.  Specific consideration would have resulted
    in the same factual conclusions.

10.  In response Mr Melvin highlighted the fact that the claimant had  spent
    the first 46 years of his life in Portugal and had only spent  a  small
    percentage of his life in the United Kingdom.  The panel also expressed
    doubt about the truthfulness of his claim to have been  nothing  but  a
    careful driver.

Our Assessment

11.  We concur with Mr Seelhoff that it is not open to the SSHD to  seek  to
    raise for the first time at the hearing before us  concerns  about  the
    claimant's employment history.  There was documentary  evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal that the claimant began work in 2001 and  there
    had been no challenge to this evidence  either  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal or in the grounds  of  appeal.   The  clear  and  unchallenged
    finding of fact made by the panel was that  the  claimant  had  been  a
    worker since 2001  and  had  thus  established  ten  years'  continuous
    residence.

12.  However, by virtue of regulation 19, the claimant was only entitled  to
    the highest level of protection on the basis of ten  years'  continuous
    residence if that period was not broken by his period  of  imprisonment
    which commenced on 1 August 2012 and ended  just  short  of  two  years
    later  on  22  July  2014.   The  centrality  of  this  test  has  been
    established by the CJEU ruling in MG.  That ruling also  confirms  that
    in calculating the ten years one counts  back  from  the  date  of  the
    decision to deport, in the claimant's case backwards from  24  February
    2014.

13.  One searches in vain for any apprehension that  this  was  the  correct
    test by the First-tier Tribunal  panel.   Its  only  justification  for
    concluding that the claimant had the qualifying period of ten years was
    given in paragraph 22 which states:

         "The Appellant and his family have resided in the UK for many years
         and have clearly become integrated.  We did not unfortunately  have
         the benefit  of  risk  assessment  before  us  from  the  Probation
         Service.  It  is  clear  however  that  the  risk  relates  to  the
         Appellant's driving but he and his wife have said that he does  not
         intend to drive again in the UK and we fervently hope that he keeps
         to this pledge.  In the near term he is in any  event  disqualified
         from doing so.  It is also reasonable to suppose that the Appellant
         would have finally gained some insight into how  lethal  a  vehicle
         can be on a public highway after having been involved in two  fatal
         accidents within a short period of time (despite his  disappointing
         denial at the hearing that he had ever been other  than  a  careful
         driver).  Given the high threshold for removal,  we  find  that  it
         would not be in accordance with EEA law for  the  Appellant  to  be
         removed.  We therefore allow the appeal under the EEA Regulations."

14.  The panel clearly thought its only task was to ascertain,  pursuant  to
    regulation 21, whether it was proportionate  for  the  claimant  to  be
    deported in light of his conduct (which had  to  represent  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of
    society) and having regard to a number of factors including his  length
    of residence in the UK and his social  and  cultural  integration.   It
    simply assumed without any analysis  that  the  claimant  stood  to  be
    assessed  on  the  basis  of   ten  years  of   continuous   residence,
    notwithstanding his period of imprisonment.  There was no reference  at
    all to the possible impact on the claimant's  asserted  integration  of
    his period of imprisonment.  The representatives at the hearing did not
    refer the panel to the CJEU ruling in MG, nor did the panel refer to it
    themselves.  It is impossible to avoid the conclusion  that  the  panel
    simply failed to grasp what the correct test was.  Its failure in  this
    respect was a clear error of law.

15.  At the same time we cannot allow the  SSHD's  appeal  unless  satisfied
    that the panel's error of law was a material one.  Here we  have  great
    difficulty with the SSHD's submissions and Mr Melvin's oral development
    of these.  From the guidance given by the CJEU in MG, it is clear  that
    we have to consider whether the claimant's integrative links  with  the
    UK were broken in August 2012 by his imprisonment.  Two factors seem to
    be of prime importance in this regard.  First of all, by  the  time  he
    was imprisoned he had lived and worked in the UK for over eleven years.
     Secondly, he also had a family life in the UK with  his  second  wife,
    who is a Portuguese national, and his son H (d.o.b.  2/11/80)  who  has
    cerebral palsy and is severely disabled (he is also  Portuguese).   The
    claimant also has a daughter who has settled in the UK with her partner
    and child.  The finding of fact made by the First-tier Tribunal panel -
    not challenged by the respondent - was that the claimant's family  have
    become integrated into the UK.  Thus his integration links consist  not
    only of employment in the UK but also residence for a lengthy period by
    his family whose integration into the UK is not challenged.  There  are
    certainly factors that point to  a  lack  of  certain  other  types  of
    integrative links - e.g. he chose to use a  Portuguese  interpreter  at
    the hearing before the FtT; by the time  he  came  to  the  UK  he  was
    already in his 40's, so his cultural links with Portugal  would  appear
    to be very entrenched.  However, it cannot seriously be argued that the
    absence of such links negated the strong family links, coupled with his
    continuous engagement with the UK labour market.

16.   A  second  factor  of  undoubted  importance  is  the  fact  that  the
    claimant's imprisonment was for a period  of  slightly  less  than  two
    years.  The SSHD is plainly right to emphasise the serious  criminality
    of the claimant and the claimant's evident disregard for  the  law  and
    lack of insight into his own behaviour as a driver.  However, that does
    not alter the fact that his period in prison was less  than  two  years
    and that, in deciding whether that broke his  integrative  links,  this
    relatively limited period had  to  be  balanced  against  his  previous
    lengthy period  of  residence  in  the  UK  where  he  had  established
    integrative links of some eleven years.

17.  We observe that in the MG case the CJEU  was  asked  what  significance
    should be attached to a case in which an  applicant  had  already  been
    resident in the host Member State for ten years  at  paragraphs  35-37.
    The CJEU stated:

         "35. As for the question of the extent to which the  non-continuous
             nature  of  the  period  of  residence  during  the  10  years
             preceding the decision to expel the person concerned  prevents
             him from enjoying enhanced protection, an  overall  assessment
             must be made of that person's situation on  each  occasion  at
             the precise time when the question of expulsion  arises  (see,
             to that effect, Tsakouridis, paragraph 32).


         36.   In  that  regard,  given  that,  in  principle,  periods   of
             imprisonment  interrupt  the  continuity  of  the  period   of
             residence for the purposes of Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
             2004/38, such periods may - together with  the  other  factors
             going to make up the entirety of  relevant  considerations  in
             each individual case - be taken into account by  the  national
             authorities responsible for applying  Article  28(3)  of  that
             directive as part  of  the  overall  assessment  required  for
             determining whether the integrating  links  previously  forged
             with the host Member State have  been  broken,  and  thus  for
             determining whether the enhanced protection  provided  for  in
             that  provision  will  be  granted  (see,  to   that   effect,
             Tsakouridis, paragraph 34).


         37.  Lastly, as regards the  implications  of  the  fact  that  the
             person concerned has resided in the host Member  State  during
             the 10 years prior to imprisonment, it should be borne in mind
             that, even though - as has been stated in paragraphs 24 and 25
             above - the 10-year period  of  residence  necessary  for  the
             grant of the  enhanced  protection  provided  for  in  Article
             28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 must be calculated  by  counting
             back from the date of  the  decision  ordering  that  person's
             expulsion, the fact that the  calculation  carried  out  under
             that provision is  different  from  the  calculation  for  the
             purposes of the grant of a right of permanent residence  means
             that the fact that the person concerned resided  in  the  host
             Member State during the 10 years prior to imprisonment may  be
             taken into consideration as part  of  the  overall  assessment
             referred to in paragraph 36 above."

18.  We are entirely satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal could only  have
    concluded in the claimant's case that his imprisonment  did  not  break
    his integrative links.  In concluding thus we have given full weight to
    the fact that the claimant had not only spent time in  prison  but  had
    also engaged in conduct in 2009 and 2011 that  was  both  criminal  and
    anti-social.  He had shown disregard for the law in failing to have  an
    eye test.  He had tampered with his lorry tachograph.  It  is  possible
    that his conduct for the entirety of the period between 2009  and  2011
    was contrary to the fundamental interests  of  society.   Nevertheless,
    such considerations cannot  alter  the  fact  that  there  was  genuine
    integration established before  that  and  the  claimant's  integrative
    links have to be looked at not just in relation to him on his  own  but
    in the context that his family included two other EEA nationals in  the
    UK in their own right.

19.  Whilst the FtT did not engage with the  issue  of  whether  integrative
    links had been broken we agree with Mr Seelhoff that it is  clear  from
    their findings of fact, having heard evidence from the claimant's wife,
    that the strength of his integrative links with the UK were  such  that
    their interruption by just under two years  of  prison  did  not  break
    them.

20.  Accordingly, we consider that  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  although  it
    wrongly applied the relevant law  regarding  periods  of  imprisonment,
    arrived at  a  rational  and  lawful  conclusion  that  the  claimant's
    continuous residence in the UK could be taken to be over ten years.

21.  The only remaining issue is whether the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    concluding that there were no imperative grounds of public  policy  for
    deportation  of  the  claimant.   Here,  once  again,  we  consider  it
    pertinent to refer to CJEU guidance, this time guidance  given  by  its
    Grand Chamber on the meaning of imperative grounds of  public  security
    in Case C-348/09, P.I. v Oberb�rgermeist erin der Stadt  Remscheld,  22
    May 2012, in particular at paragraph 33:

         "33. In the light of the foregoing considerations,  the  answer  to
             the question referred is that Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
             2004/38 must be interpreted as meaning that it is open to  the
             Member States  to  regard  criminal  offences  such  as  those
             referred to in the second subparagraph of Article  83(1)  TFEU
             as constituting a particularly serious threat to  one  of  the
             fundamental interests of society, which might  pose  a  direct
             threat to the calm and physical security of the population and
             thus be covered by  the  concept  of  'imperative  grounds  of
             public security', capable of justifying an  expulsion  measure
             under Article 28(3), as long  as  the  manner  in  which  such
             offences  were  committed   discloses   particularly   serious
             characteristics, which is a matter for the referring court  to
             determine on the basis of an  individual  examination  of  the
             specific case before it."

22.  We have very considerable sympathy with the view of the SSHD as to  the
    reprehensible  nature  of  the  claimant's  conduct.    He   has   been
    responsible for the deaths of  two  innocent  people,  one  a  cyclist,
    another an elderly pedestrian.  In  relation  to  the  killing  of  the
    elderly  pedestrian  he  was  guilty  of  dangerous  driving  and   the
    particulars of his case  show  that  it  came  about  through  his  own
    negligent and obtuse attitude to his own driving ability, coupled  with
    falsification of his  lorry  tachograph  details.   The  fact  that  he
    appears even today not to accept that this conduct was contumelious  is
    chilling.  At the same time, even cast in its worst garb,  his  conduct
    is clearly considerably short of what the CJEU had  in  mind  for  this
    level of protection, at paragraph 33 of P.I.

23.  Another difficulty in the way of  the  respondent's  case  is  that  in
    relation to all three levels of protection it is necessary to show that
    a claimant is a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the
    fundamental interests of society.  Even accepting  (as  we  have  done)
    that the claimant was  previously  someone  who  posed  a  genuine  and
    sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of society, we
    cannot see that he was so at the date of  hearing  before  the  FtT  in
    September 2014.  By that time he had been banned from driving  and  the
    First-tier Tribunal appears to have accepted. On the  strength  of  the
    evidence of the claimant's wife, that he would not drive again.   Short
    of speculating that the claimant would either  contravene  the  driving
    ban or hold specific intentions to regain his licence  in  the  future,
    the SSHD cannot reasonably argue that he posed a  "present"  threat  to
    society by driving again.  That is true even if  we  accept  he  has  a
    propensity to re-offend in respect of his driving.  There has  been  no
    suggestion that he harbours criminal proclivities outside  the  context
    of driving.



24.  Had we been applying UK law governing deportation of foreign  criminals
    we may well have concluded that his deportation  was  both  lawful  and
    proportionate, but the claimant is an EEA national and his case must be
    decided under the relevant EU law provisions as transposed into our law
    by the 2006 EEA Regulations. It  is  not  within  our  legal  power  to
    direct, but we would express our hope that this man is never allowed to
    drive again.

Notice of Decision

For the above reasons we conclude that despite falling into legal error  the
FtT did not materially err in law and accordingly the  appeal  of  the  SSHD
against its decision is dismissed. No anonymity direction is made.
