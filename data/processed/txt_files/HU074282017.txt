Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
An anonymity direction was made earlier in the proceedings. I  continue  the
anonymity direction because the case involves a child. Unless  and  until  a
tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity.  No
report of these proceedings shall directly or  indirectly  identify  him  or
any member of his family. This direction applies both to the  appellant  and
to the respondent.


Representation:
For the Appellant:     The Appellant appeared in person
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By a decision dated 12 February  2019  ("the  Decision"),  I  and  Lord
    Beckett found an error of law in the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  J  K  Swaney  promulgated  on  15  October  2018  allowing   the
    Appellant's appeal.   The  Decision  is  annexed  hereto  for  ease  of
    reference.  In light of our conclusions, we set  aside  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision and gave directions for a  resumed  hearing  before
    me.

 2. At the hearing before me, the Appellant was no longer represented as he
    said that he could not afford a barrister.  I explained  the  procedure
    for the hearing to him and he indicated that he was content to proceed.
     He was extremely well-prepared and read to me a prepared statement  of
    his case to which I refer below so far as appropriate.   He  also  gave
    evidence by way of his earlier written witness statements and orally in
    response to questions from Mr Tufan and  some  clarificatory  questions
    from me.  His evidence is also recorded below so far as necessary.

 3. The history of the Appellant's case is adequately set out at [1] to [6]
    of the Decision and I do  not  repeat  those  matters.   There  is  one
    additional factor which I need to take into account  and  that  is  the
    birth of the Appellant's third  child,  his  second  with  his  current
    partner.  That is dealt with in a  further  statement  dated  13  March
    2019.  His daughter was born on 17  February  2019.   I  refer  to  her
    hereafter as [D] to avoid confusion as she bears the  same  initial  as
    her brother.  I also received a further statement  in  the  form  of  a
    letter from the Appellant's partner who I refer to hereafter as [C].  I
    did not hear evidence from her although she was  at  the  hearing  with
    both [A] and [D].  I will also need to refer to the  Appellant's  other
    child from a previous relationship, [K] and to her mother, [T] who is a
    British citizen.

 4. Although I have set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision, there  is
    no  factual  dispute  save  on  one  issue  which  I   mention   below.
    Accordingly, it remains appropriate to  have  regard  to  the  evidence
    which the Appellant gave in that appeal as recorded at [10] to [23]  of
    that decision.  It is also appropriate to have  regard  to  what  Judge
    Swaney said about the documentary evidence  at  [45]  to  [57]  of  her
    decision.  However,  it  will  be  necessary  for  me  to  revisit  the
    underlying documents in order to form  my  own  assessment  about  what
    those show and the impact of them in relation to the central issues.

 5. There is one additional factual matter which concerns  the  Appellant's
    entry into and residence in the UK.  Mr Tufan sought  to  introduce  in
    evidence two visa applications dated 16 September 2004 and 7 July  2005
    respectively in the Appellant's name.  The first of those  applications
    (both for a multi visit visa) was granted on 17 September 2004 until 17
    March 2005.  The second was refused  on  8  July  2005.   Both  bear  a
    photograph of a child.  Both make reference to a date  of  birth  of  2
    January 1988 (which is the Appellant's date of birth).  Both  bear  the
    same details in relation to the names of the child's  parents  and  the
    same passport number.  A copy of the bio-data details is annexed to the
    second of the applications.  The refusal of that application refers  to
    it being made via the drop-box and being considered on the basis of the
    documents.  The refusal is on the basis  that  the  passport  does  not
    reflect the applicant's true immigration history.  I will come  to  the
    importance of that in due course.  In response the Appellant produced a
    copy of a  student  card  which  does  not  provide  details  beyond  a
    photograph and name.  He also  produced  a  letter  from  [A]'s  school
    providing updated evidence as to the Appellant's son.

 6. In addition to the above-mentioned evidence, I have and have had regard
    to  the  totality  of  the  evidence  contained  in  the   bundle   and
    supplementary bundle produced on behalf of  the  Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  I have read all that evidence but refer  only  to
    that evidence relevant to the issues which  I  have  to  decide.   When
    referring to the documents, I adopt the formulation [AB/xx] in relation
    to documents in the first of the Appellant's  bundles  and  [SB/xx]  in
    relation to documents in the supplementary bundle.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

 7. The factors relevant to the assessment of the  Appellant's  appeal  are
    set out in summary form at [4] of  the  Decision.   The  Appellant  was
    convicted on 29 November 2013 of two charges of  conspiracy  to  supply
    controlled drugs for which he was sentenced to a term  of  imprisonment
    to 4 ï¿½ years.  As such,  whether  under  the  Immigration  Rules  ("the
    Rules") or in accordance with Section 117C Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117C") the test is  whether  there  are  very
    compelling circumstances over and above the exceptions set out  in  the
    Rules or Section 117C.   The relevant parts of the  Rules  and  Section
    117C are set out at [29] and [30] of the Decision and I do not need  to
    set them out again.

 8. In summary, in order to succeed, the Appellant needs to show  that  the
    factors in his case amount to very compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above the exceptions in Section 117C and the Rules which would, if  his
    sentence had been lower, permit him to succeed based on either or  both
    of his private and family life.

 9. However, it is also relevant to that  question  whether  the  Appellant
    could meet either of those exceptions if they did  apply.  The  way  in
    which the test operates was explained by the  Court  of  Appeal  in  NA
    (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ
    662 as follows:


         "[29]    In our view, the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in JZ
         (Zambia) applies to those provisions. The phrase used in section
         117C(6), in para. 398 of the 2014 rules and which we have held is
         to be read into section 117C(3) does not mean that a foreign
         criminal facing deportation is altogether disentitled from seeking
         to rely on matters falling within the scope of the circumstances
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2 when seeking to contend that "there
         are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described
         in Exceptions 1 and 2". As we have indicated above, a foreign
         criminal is entitled to rely upon such matters, but he would need
         to be able to point to features of his case of a kind mentioned in
         Exceptions 1 and 2 (and in paras. 399 or 399A of the 2014 rules),
         or features falling outside the circumstances described in those
         Exceptions and those paragraphs, which made his claim based on
         Article 8 especially strong.
         [30] In the case of a serious offender who could point to
         circumstances in his own case which could be said to correspond to
         the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2, but where he
         could only just succeed in such an argument, it would not be
         possible to describe his situation as involving very compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
         2. One might describe that as a bare case of the kind described in
         Exceptions 1 or 2. On the other hand, if he could point to factors
         identified in the descriptions of Exceptions 1 and 2 of an
         especially compelling kind in support of an Article 8 claim, going
         well beyond what would be necessary to make out a bare case of the
         kind described in Exceptions 1 and 2, they could in principle
         constitute "very compelling circumstances, over and above those
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2", whether taken by themselves or in
         conjunction with other factors relevant to application of Article
         8."

10. Again, in short summary, the first of the  exceptions  referred  to  in
    that extract concerns private life.  The Appellant would need  to  show
    that he had been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life, that
    he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK and that there would
    be very significant obstacles to his integration in Nigeria.  In  terms
    of his family life, the Appellant would need to  show  that  he  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who  is  settled  in
    the UK or British or with a child who is British or has lived in the UK
    for at least seven years and that in either event, that the  effect  of
    the Appellant's deportation would be unduly harsh for that  partner  or
    child.

11. The Supreme Court has recently provided guidance in relation to the way
    in which the test of "unduly harsh" is to apply in order  to  meet  the
    second exception in KO (Nigeria) and others v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53.  Indeed, we found in  the  Decision
    that the way in which Judge Swaney had applied the test was contrary to
    that guidance (although unsurprisingly since her decision pre-dated the
    Supreme Court's judgment).    The  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  the
    question whether the effect was unduly harsh was  an  assessment  which
    had to be made based solely on the impact  on  either  the  partner  or
    child, taking no account of the public interest  in  deportation  which
    was already built in to the exception.  However, the Supreme Court drew
    attention to the high level of impact required to satisfy the  test  as
    follows:


         "23.     On the other hand  the  expression  "unduly  harsh"  seems
         clearly  intended  to  introduce  a  higher  hurdle  than  that  of
         "reasonableness" under  section  117B(6),  taking  account  of  the
         public interest in the deportation of  foreign  criminals.  Further
         the word "unduly" implies an element of comparison. It assumes that
         there is a "due" level of "harshness", that is a level which may be
         acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context. "Unduly" implies
         something going beyond that level. The relevant context is that set
         by section 117C(1), that is the public interest in the  deportation
         of foreign criminals. One is looking  for  a  degree  of  harshness
         going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child faced
         with the deportation of a parent. What it does not  require  in  my
         view (and subject to the  discussion  of  the  cases  in  the  next
         section) is a balancing of  relative  levels  of  severity  of  the
         parent's offence, other than is inherent in the  distinction  drawn
         by the section itself by  reference  to  length  of  sentence.  Nor
         (contrary to the view of the Court of  Appeal  in IT  (Jamaica)  v
         Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department [2016]  EWCA  Civ
         932, [2017] 1 WLR 240, paras 55, 64) can  it  be  equated  with  a
         requirement to show "very compelling reasons".  That  would  be  in
         effect to replicate the additional test applied by section  117C(6)
         with respect to sentences of four years or more.
         ...
         27.              Authoritative  guidance  as  to  the  meaning  of
         "unduly harsh" in this context was  given  by  the  Upper  Tribunal
         (McCloskey J President and UT Judge Perkins) in MK (Sierra Leone) v
         Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department [2015]  UKUT  223
         (IAC), [2015] INLR 563, para 46, a decision given on 15 April 2015.
         They referred  to  the  "evaluative  assessment"  required  of  the
         tribunal:
         "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh'  does
         not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or  merely
         difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold.
         'Harsh' in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It  is
         the  antithesis  of  pleasant  or  comfortable.  Furthermore,   the
         addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated standard
         still higher."
         On the facts of that particular case, the Upper Tribunal held  that
         the test was satisfied:
           "Approached in this way, we have  no  hesitation  in  concluding
           that it would be unduly harsh for either of the two  seven  year
           old British citizen children concerned to be  abruptly  uprooted
           from their United Kingdom life setting and lifestyle and  exiled
           to  this  struggling,  impoverished  and  plague  stricken  west
           African state. No reasonable  or  right  thinking  person  would
           consider this anything less that cruel."
         This view was based simply on the wording of  the  subsection,  and
         did not apparently depend on any view of the relative  severity  of
         the particular offence. I do not understand the conclusion  on  the
         facts of that case to be controversial."

12. In the context of considering whether the  impact  of  the  Appellant's
    deportation on his children would be unduly harsh,  I  must  of  course
    have regard to section 55 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009
    ("Section 55") concerning what the best  interests  of  those  children
    require.  In so doing, I note that, whilst the best  interests  of  the
    child must be a primary consideration, they are not  the  only  primary
    consideration - see what is said in Zoumbas v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2013] I WLR 3690.  That is particularly  important
    in a deportation case where the public interest in removal  is  higher.
    A child's best interests are considerations  which  still  have  to  be
    weighed in the balance against other competing interests.

13. Furthermore, as I have already observed, the Appellant  cannot  succeed
    simply on the basis of satisfying either or both of the exceptions  and
    I have to consider whether there are very compelling circumstances over
    and above the exceptions.  That assessment  does  import  wider  public
    interest considerations as is explained in the Presidential decision of
    this Tribunal in  MS  (s.117C  (6):  "very  compelling  circumstances")
    Philippines [2019] UKUT 122 (IAC) ("MS"), the headnote to  which  reads
    as follows:

         "(1) In determining pursuant to section 117C(6) of the Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 whether there are  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2
         in subsections (4) and (5), such as to outweigh the public interest
         in the deportation of a foreign criminal, a court or tribunal  must
         take into account, together with any other relevant public interest
         considerations, the seriousness of the particular offence of  which
         the foreign criminal was convicted; not merely whether the  foreign
         criminal was or was not sentenced to imprisonment of  more  than  4
         years. Nothing in KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
         Department [2018] UKSC 53 demands a contrary conclusion."

14. The second paragraph of the headnote in MS refers to what  is  said  by
    the Supreme Court in Hesham Ali v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] UKSC 60 ("Hesham Ali").  Although,  as  the  Tribunal
    notes in MS, the judgment in Hesham Ali pre-dates the  introduction  of
    Part 5A of the 2002 Act which includes, inter alia, Section 117C,  that
    judgment is still helpful for what it  has  to  say  about  the  public
    interest in deportation  and  the  way  in  which  the  proportionality
    assessment in deportation cases should be approached, in particular  at
    [50] and [82] to  [83]  where  Lords  Reed  and  Thomas  advocated  the
    following approach:

         "50.              In summary, therefore, the tribunal carries  out
         its task on the basis of the facts as it finds them to  be  on  the
         evidence before it, and the law as established by statute and  case
         law.  Ultimately,  it  has  to  decide   whether   deportation   is
         proportionate in the  particular  case  before  it,  balancing  the
         strength of the public interest in the deportation of the  offender
         against the impact on private and family  life.  In  doing  so,  it
         should give appropriate weight to Parliament's and the Secretary of
         State's assessments of the strength of the general public  interest
         in the deportation of foreign offenders, as explained in paras  14,
         37-38 and 46 above, and also consider all factors relevant  to  the
         specific case in question. The critical issue for the tribunal will
         generally be whether, giving due weight  to  the  strength  of  the
         public interest in the deportation of  the  offender  in  the  case
         before it, the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong  to  outweigh
         it. In general, only a claim which is very  strong  indeed  -  very
         compelling, as it was put in MF (Nigeria) - will succeed."
         ...
         82.              I agree with the judgment of  Lord  Reed  and  in
         particular the matters he sets out at paras 37-38, 46 and 50. I add
         three paragraphs of my own simply to emphasise  the  importance  of
         the structure of judgments of the First-tier Tribunal in  decisions
         where article 8 is  engaged.  Judges  should,  after  making  their
         factual determinations, set out in clear and succinct  terms  their
         reasoning for the  conclusion  arrived  at  through  balancing  the
         necessary considerations in the light of the  matters  set  out  by
         Lord Reed at paras 37-38, 46 and 50. It  should  generally  not  be
         necessary to refer to any further authority in cases involving  the
         deportation of foreign offenders.
         83.              One way of structuring such a judgment would be to
         follow what has become known as the "balance sheet" approach. After
         the judge has found the facts, the judge would set out each of  the
         "pros" and "cons" in what has been described as a  "balance  sheet"
         and  then  set  out  reasoned  conclusions  as   to   whether   the
         countervailing factors outweigh  the  importance  attached  to  the
         public interest in the deportation of foreign offenders."

  15. As is made clear in Hesham Ali and also in the Tribunal's decisions in
      MS and RA (s.117C: "unduly harsh"; offence; seriousness)  Iraq  [2019]
      UKUT 00123 (IAC) ("RA"), the public interest in  deportation  includes
      not only the reduction of risk to the public but also factors such  as
      deterrence and the public's view of particular crimes.   Although,  as
      noted at [49] of the decision in  MS,   Lord  Wilson,  in  Hesham  Ali
      resiled from his comment made in  an  earlier  case  that  the  public
      interest  in  deportation  includes  the   "expression   of   societal
      revulsion" of particular crimes, he did so  only  in  the  context  of
      comments made at [69] and [70] of the judgment  which  underlined  the
      continued importance of  deterrence  and  departed  from  the  earlier
      comment only on the basis that it was "on reflection,  too  emotive  a
      concept to figure in this analysis". The point is also made in RA,  as
      reflected in the headnote in that case,  that  "[r]ehabilitation  will
      not ordinarily bear material weight in favour of a foreign criminal."

THE EVIDENCE

The Evidence of the Appellant

16. The Appellant has provided three written statements dated 17  May  2017
    ([AB/53-60], 1 October 2018 ([SB/1-5]) and 13 March 2019  (to  which  I
    have already referred).  He also answered questions at the hearing from
    Mr Tufan and from me.  In addition, because he was not represented, his
    oral submissions tended to be focussed on the evidential aspect of  his
    case rather than the law.  I obviously intend no criticism  of  him  in
    that regard, but it is therefore appropriate for me to  consider  those
    submissions as part of his evidence.

17. The Appellant came to the UK in 1999 with his mother. He was  aged  ten
    years. His mother left him here with his aunt and never  returned.   He
    does not know where his mother is or what has  happened  to  her.   His
    aunt has since died.  The Appellant continued to live  with  his  aunt.
    Her partner did not like the Appellant living with them and their child
    and mistreated the Appellant, sometimes locking him out  of  the  home.
    The Appellant was not given money for  lunch  at  school  and  was  not
    entitled to free lunches.  He worked after school to  earn  some  money
    but returned home late and found himself locked out and sleeping in the
    basement of the flats where they lived.

18. On one occasion, the Appellant  was  approached  by  a  man,  [M],  who
    invited him to play for a football team which [M] coached.  He  did  so
    although was not always able to attend as he had to babysit his  aunt's
    child.  The Appellant finally disclosed his circumstances to [M].   [M]
    invited the Appellant to go and stay  with  him  if  he  found  himself
    locked out of his aunt's flat.  He did that on  three  occasions.   [M]
    abused the Appellant on the third occasion (although  it  appears  from
    his statement that the Appellant was concerned about  [M]'s  intentions
    on the second occasion also). The Appellant has never reported this  to
    the authorities as [M] said that the Appellant would  not  be  believed
    and would get his aunt into trouble due to  the  Appellant's  irregular
    immigration status.  The  Appellant  left  the  football  club.   These
    events occurred, it appears, in about 2001.

19. The Appellant left school in 2003 with five GCSEs at Grades  B  and  C.
    He decided to go to college.  He enrolled first at John Ruskin  college
    in 2004.  However, he still had to work to pay his fees and as a result
    his education suffered.  He failed  his  two  years  of  college  as  a
    result.

20. The Appellant then enrolled at Coulsdon College and was able to  obtain
    the grades necessary to secure a place at  university.   In  2007,  the
    Appellant completed a foundation course in law and then started  a  law
    degree course in Coventry in 2008.

21. Whilst at college, the Appellant's daughter, [K] had been born  to  [T]
    in April 2006.  She is now aged thirteen years.  [K] and [T]  lived  in
    London.  The Appellant did not live with them.  He met  and  married  a
    Portuguese national, [L], in May 2009.  As a result of  this  marriage,
    the Appellant was given a residence card from 7 July  2010  to  7  July
    2015, having made an application on that basis in February  2010.   The
    Appellant was living and studying in Coventry but  commuting  back  and
    forth to London to visit his daughter.  As a result, he says, he failed
    the first year of his degree.

22. It is unclear when the Appellant's marriage to [L] came to an end.   He
    told me that the relationship broke down  because  [L]  knew  that  his
    immigration status was uncertain and that therefore she had a hold over
    him.  She therefore acted in a "condescending" and "patronising" manner
    towards him.  He even went so far as to assert in his submissions  that
    she physically and verbally abused him.  That is not mentioned  in  his
    statements.

23. Whatever the position in relation to that marriage, the Appellant  says
    that, having failed the first year of his degree, he  decided  that  he
    should  "take  some  steps  to  improve  [his]  life  circumstance  and
    hopefully become a bit more settled".   He  therefore  applied  to  the
    Nigerian High Commission for a passport.  He says that one  was  issued
    but with a wrong date of birth.  A date of birth of  31  December  1985
    was entered.  He says he queried the error, but the authorities refused
    to change the details, and so he decided to keep the passport.   Little
    turns on that error. It appears that it was  this  passport  which  was
    used to support the residence card application.

24. By 2010, the Appellant had moved to London.  He  enrolled  at  BPP  law
    school in London.  He then became associated with someone he had  known
    from school, [MO].  He and [MO] trained  together  at  the  gym.   [MO]
    asked the Appellant if he  could  stay  with  him  because  he  had  an
    altercation with his partner.  The Appellant came to know that [MO] was
    a notorious drug dealer.  He asked [MO] to leave but [MO] refused to do
    so.  He and his henchmen threatened the Appellant and [K], his daughter
    with harm if the Appellant refused to deal  drugs  for  [MO].   He  was
    advised by another friend to do as [MO] said  and  not  to  go  to  the
    police.  So it was, the Appellant says, that he  became  involved  with
    the behaviour which led to his conviction which is the index offence in
    relation to deportation.  The conviction was in November 2013.

25. The Appellant says that he claimed  in  defence  of  the  drug  dealing
    charge that he was acting under duress due to the circumstances which I
    have outlined above.  He told me that his representatives had failed to
    mention these in his mitigation.  He says in  his  statement  that  the
    prosecution had argued that the Appellant had a lead role  and  he  was
    found guilty in spite of the plea.   The  Appellant  says  that  he  is
    ashamed about this offending and remorseful.  He says in his  statement
    that he was "so stupid and naï¿½ve"  and  "should  have  dealt  with  the
    situation a lot more responsibly".  I  will  come  on  to  the  Judge's
    sentencing remarks for that offence in due course.

26. It is appropriate to mention at this juncture that the index offence is
    not the only offence of which the Appellant has been  convicted  albeit
    it is the only one which has  led  to  a  term  of  imprisonment.   The
    Appellant admitted during cross-examination that he had been  cautioned
    in 2005 for possession of cannabis but said  that  this  was  only  for
    personal use.  He also  admitted  that  he  was  convicted  of  driving
    offences in 2011 for which he had served a community sentence.

27. The Appellant was released from prison in August 2015.  He says that he
    has learned his lesson following his sentence.  He completed  a  number
    of courses during  his  sentence.   He  has  learnt  "how  to  be  more
    assertive in making  decisions  and  deciding  the  best  and  positive
    options for whatever situation [he] finds [himself]".  He  has  avoided
    involvement with anyone other  than  his  family  since  release.   The
    Appellant's probation officer has provided a letter confirming that she
    had no concerns about his lifestyle and associates, that the  Appellant
    was fully aware of the impact of his offending behaviour and  had  been
    able to address the triggers and to avoid situations which  might  lead
    to those triggers.  The letter is undated but must  have  been  written
    prior to May 2017 as  it  refers  to  the  letter  being  provided  for
    representations due on 23 May.  The period of supervision  was  due  to
    last until November 2017.  There is no  update  from  that  source  but
    equally nothing  to  suggest  that  the  Appellant  has  committed  any
    offences since the index offence.

28. The Appellant says that, if he were allowed to remain, he would like to
    act as a mentor for other young people at danger of  becoming  involved
    in crime to stop them making the same mistakes that he  had  made.   He
    also wants to be a role model to his children to ensure that they  grow
    up to be the best they can.

29. The Appellant met [C] whilst awaiting his criminal trial.  During  that
    period, she became pregnant and [A] was born in February  2014.  He  is
    now aged five years. [C] is a British citizen and therefore [A] is also
    a British citizen.  [A] was born after the Appellant was imprisoned but
    [C] and [A] visited the Appellant in prison on a regular basis.  I note
    from the evidence of those visits that, on many occasions, [C] and  [A]
    were accompanied by [C]'s mother with whom, it appears, they  may  have
    been living  at  that  time.  [K]  did  not  visit  the  Appellant  but
    corresponded with him by letter.

30. The main factor on which the Appellant relies is his relationship  with
    his children, [K], [A] and now [D].  In fact, in  his  submissions,  he
    went so far as to say that "he would have faced up to [deportation]" if
    it had not been for his children and the impact that his removal  would
    have on them.

31. The Appellant is mainly responsible for [A]'s daily care.  [C] works as
    a nurse and has to leave home usually at about 7.30am returning at 5pm.
     She would not be able to drop [A] off and pick  him  up  from  school.
    [A] is having some  problems  with  being  bullied  at  school  and  is
    naturally therefore reluctant to attend.  The  school  is  said  to  be
    addressing the issue, but the Appellant says  that  it  is  he  who  is
    responsible for encouraging [A] to go to school.   The  Appellant  says
    that [A] is heavily reliant on him. He gave  me  an  example  of  [A]'s
    reaction when the Appellant had hidden behind a hedge on their  way  to
    school and [A] had turned round, and thought his father was not  there.
    The Appellant says that [A]'s "life nearly crumbled".

32. The Appellant also takes [A] to the park and plays football  with  him.
    The Appellant taught [A] to ride his bike.  He helps [A]  with  reading
    and writing.

33. Although the Appellant does not live with [K] and [T] (and  it  is  not
    clear to me from the evidence that he ever has), he also enjoys a close
    bond with his daughter.  He goes to collect her  at  weekends  and  she
    spends the weekend with  the  Appellant,  [C]  and  [A].  They  go  out
    together as a family. The Appellant also picks [K] up from school  when
    [T] is unable to do so.  He attends [K]'s  parent  evenings  at  school
    (with [T]) and helps [K] with homework.  He provides here with guidance
    and emotional support.  He says that she was "devastated" when  he  was
    in prison. The Appellant says that he has a strong bond  with  [K]  and
    that she also has  a  strong  bond  with  her  half-brother  [A].   The
    Appellant says that the relationship between [K] and [A] would  not  be
    able to continue if he were deported.  He told me  that,  although  [T]
    had never been obstructive about him seeing [K], the visits  would  not
    continue if he were not there as he is the common link and it "wouldn't
    work with these two women".

34. The Appellant says that [K], [A] and [D] are all at critical points  in
    their development and that his removal would have a detrimental  impact
    on them all.  [K] is a teenager at secondary school working towards her
    exams.  [A] has just started primary school.  [D] has  just  been  born
    and has yet to form a bond with the Appellant.  The Appellant  admitted
    that none of the children has any health problems.  It was suggested at
    an earlier stage that [A] was  autistic  but  the  Appellant  confirmed
    that, following a referral, that was found not to be the case.  He does
    though have some learning and development  problems  for  which  he  is
    receiving  additional  assistance.   Although  he  accepted  that   his
    children could remain in contact via Skype etc, and, at  least  in  the
    case of [A] and [D], by visits to see him in Nigeria (although  he  did
    not know where they would visit as he  did  not  know  where  he  would
    live), he said that this would be no substitute for the close bond they
    currently enjoy.

35. The Appellant's case in relation to his family life is  also  that  [C]
    would not cope in his absence as he provides the main care for [A] (and
    [D] once [C]'s maternity leave is over).  She would not be able to work
    and provide childcare.

36. Although, as I have noted above, the Appellant accepts  that  the  main
    factor on which he relies is the position  of  his  children,  he  also
    points out that he has not been to Nigeria since he was a young  child.
    He does not know anyone there.  He does not know where his  mother  is.
    Although the Appellant accepted what we had  to  say  in  the  Decision
    about the relevance of his abuse to his offending in terms of the  time
    lag, he submitted that this and his background as a child was something
    which had to be taken into account when assessing  the  proportionality
    of deportation as  the  circumstances  in  which  he  grew  up  were  a
    contributing factor to his offending and, having recognised his mistake
    and the impact of it, there was not a risk that he would reoffend.

Evidence of [C]

37. [C] has provided a letter dated "2017" ([AB/63-64]), a statement  dated
    1 October 2018 ([SB/7-10]) and a letter dated 12 March 2019  which  was
    provided at the hearing. Although [C] was present at the  hearing,  she
    had both children with her, and Mr Tufan having indicated that  he  had
    no questions to ask her, I did not consider it necessary to  hear  from
    her.

38. I do not repeat those parts of [C]'s evidence which overlap  with  that
    of the Appellant.  She deals with  the  problems  she  faced  when  the
    Appellant was in prison.  She was twenty-five weeks' pregnant with  [A]
    when the Appellant was sent to prison.  She  gave  birth  by  caesarean
    section.  Notwithstanding those difficult  circumstances,  she  ensured
    that she took [A] to see the  Appellant  regularly  from  very  shortly
    after his birth so that father and son could form a bond. She continued
    to visit at least every two weeks.  They also attended a family day  in
    prison.

39. [C] says that she found it very difficult to cope  in  the  Appellant's
    absence.  She cried frequently and was depressed.   However,  she  says
    that she managed  to  get  through  because  she  knew  that  he  would
    eventually be released from prison.

40. [C] was diagnosed with IBS in 2016.  She is  in  great  pain  when  her
    symptoms flare up.  Although she accepts that medication has alleviated
    the problems to some extent, she says that  she  still  gets  bouts  of
    symptoms on frequent occasions.

41.  [C]  has  also  been  diagnosed  with  "adenomysis"  which  gives  her
    significant pain for at least two weeks per month during  menstruation.
    She is given medication to help with the pain but has  been  told  that
    her condition will continue unless she has a hysterectomy which she  is
    reluctant to do.

42. [C] says that when her medical conditions give her pain, the  Appellant
    is able to help by caring for the  children.   She  says  in  her  most
    recent letter that, were it not for  the  Appellant's  assistance  with
    childcare, she "most likely" would also be unable to work  which  would
    have a negative, financial impact on the family and  on  the  stability
    which she and the Appellant can offer the children.

43. I noted above that, on a number of occasions when the Appellant was  in
    prison, [C]'s mother visited with [C] and [A].  [C]'s  letter  in  2017
    refers to living in temporary accommodation due to a breakdown  in  the
    relationship between mother and daughter.  It is not  clear  when  that
    occurred nor whether it is irreconcilable.  However, to the extent that
    [C] relied on support from that  quarter  when  the  Appellant  was  in
    prison, it may no longer be available.

44. It is fair to observe, however, that the main content of [C]'s evidence
    is concerned with the impact of  the  Appellant's  deportation  on  the
    children either directly or indirectly due to his absence  for  support
    like childcare.  [C] says in her statement that "if [the Appellant] was
    not here to watch  his  son  grow  up  then  this  would  be  extremely
    detrimental  to  his  development  and  feeling  of  stability.    [The
    Appellant] is [A]'s world and he looks up to him with a sparkle in  his
    eye.  From birth [the Appellant] has been [A]'s protector and has given
    him an abundance of love  and  laughter.   He  strives  to  bring  only
    complete happiness into his  life.   [A]  has  just  started  Reception
    school and if his dad was not there to run to at the end of his day  to
    tell him how school was it would devastate him utterly."  She ends  her
    statement as follows:

         "I sincerely plead that my Son's world and heart is not  broken  at
         the innocent age of 4 years old.  I desperately plead that his hero
         is not taken away from him  with  an  explanation  that  he  cannot
         possibly understand, without feeling that his father has  abandoned
         him.  I also ask that our second  child's  best  interest  is  also
         considered."

Evidence of [T]

45. [T] is the mother of [K].   She  has  provided  a  statement  dated  15
    September 2018.  Although [T] says in her statement that  she  and  the
    Appellant were in a romantic relationship for "quite  some  time",  she
    does not say when that was, and that relationship does  not  figure  in
    the Appellant's evidence save insofar as [T] gave birth to his daughter
    and that he has maintained that relationship.   For  that  reason,  and
    understandably, [T]'s statement focusses on the impact on  [K]  of  the
    Appellant's deportation.  She says that "her father means the world  to
    her" and that [K]'s  social  and  emotional  development  is  extremely
    dependent on her father".

46. [T] puts those comments in context when describing the impact on [K] of
    the Appellant's imprisonment.  She would have  been  aged  about  seven
    years at that time.  According to [T], the Appellant's  conviction  and
    imprisonment caused [K] to become withdrawn and she struggled with  her
    confidence. She is said to have needed extra tuition and  comfort  ate.
    Her school identified problems with [K]'s weight  and  her  speech  and
    language  development.   Although  the   school   apparently   arranged
    additional support, [T] says that the problems have gone away since the
    Appellant's release.

47. [T] also identifies the problems which she will face if  the  Appellant
    is removed.  She works although at the time of  her  statement  was  on
    maternity leave looking after her six months' old  child.   It  is  not
    clear whether she has the support of that  child's  father.   She  says
    that she also has to look after  her  own  grandmother.   There  is  no
    updating statement from [T].  [T] also says  that  [K]  has  "massively
    struggled to adjust to the new addition to our family but spending time
    with her father  and  brother  away  from  home  helps  to  reduce  any
    tensions".  Although she says that the  Appellant  is  "definitely  the
    glue" between [K] and [A], the sentence I have quoted suggests that [T]
    would be supportive of [K] maintaining the relationship with her  half-
    brother if the Appellant were deported.  Although  [T]  says  that  the
    deportation  of  the  Appellant  would  deny  [K]  the  possibility  of
    developing a stronger bond with [A], that assertion appears  predicated
    on an assumption that [A] would  go  with  the  Appellant  and  [C]  to
    Nigeria.

Report of Julie Meek, Independent Social Worker

48. Ms Meek is an independent social worker qualified in 2006 and  who  has
    worked within Children's Services for twelve years.  She has prepared a
    report dated 27 September 2018  following  two  home  visits  with  the
    Appellant, [C], [A] and on the second occasion [K] also.  She has  also
    spoken on the phone on six occasions with the Appellant and [C].

49. Ms Meek reports the Appellant's description  of  [A]  as  "a  fantastic
    outgoing child" which is somewhat at odds with the evidence  which  the
    Appellant and [C] provide to this Tribunal. He also  describes  [K]  as
    "kind, caring, loving and a clever daughter" and says that  she  has  a
    "wonderful character". [C] refers to [A] as being "a little  hyper"  if
    the Appellant is not there.  [A] will not settle if his father  is  not
    there.

50. The Appellant describes his relationship with [C] to Ms Meek as being a
    "strong union".  He says that she is "a great person,  loving,  caring,
    supportive, she means a lot, life without her would be unbearable". [C]
    for her part admitted that the  Appellant's  immigration  problems  had
    caused some stress for the relationship, but they were still  together.
    She  described  the  Appellant  as   "very   caring,   supportive   and
    understanding, he just wants to do the best for his  family  and  wants
    better for them all."

51. Ms Meek met with [K] on one occasion.  Since I have  no  evidence  from
    [K]  herself,  I  have  regard  to  what  Ms  Meek  says  about   [K]'s
    relationship with the Appellant.  [K] told Ms Meek that her  father  is
    "really funny sometimes and he is quite energetic".  She describes  the
    activities which they do together and confirms that he father picks her
    up from school.  She says that "it would be weird if he was  not  there
    with her".  She enjoys spending time also with [A].  Ms  Meek  observed
    the close relationship between father and daughter and between [K]  and
    [A] at first hand.

52. Ms Meek describes [A] as "very shy".  He did not really want to talk to
    her.  However, the Appellant phoned Ms Meek after the first home  visit
    and [A] spoke to her about the things which he  does  with  his  father
    which are as described in the evidence of the Appellant to which I have
    already referred.

53.  Unsurprisingly,  Ms  Meek  concludes  that  both  children  have   "an
    attachment" with their father.  The Appellant is [A]'s main  carer  and
    continues to have regular and frequent contact with [K].  Ms Meek  says
    that "separation anxiety" is a normal  part  of  childhood  development
    which usually disappears around the age of two.  It is not  clear  from
    her report that she is saying that either of the two  children  suffers
    from such anxiety.  She concludes that both [K] and  [A]  are  able  to
    draw on the support from their father and  that  the  time  spent  with
    their father gives them  confidence  to  try  out  new  things  in  the
    knowledge that she will help them if they make mistakes.  She does  not
    provide any comment about the availability of  such  support  from  the
    mothers of the two children in the event that  the  Appellant  was  not
    physically able to be with the children.

54. Ms Meek's conclusions in relation to  [K]  are  somewhat  difficult  to
    reconcile with the facts.  She says that "all [K] has ever known is her
    father being there with her".  However, the Appellant was in prison for
    about two years during which time [K] did not visit him.  There  is  no
    evidence that the Appellant has ever lived with [K] and [T] as a family
    unit.  In any event, [K]'s only comment to Ms Meek is  that  she  would
    find it "weird" if her father were not there.  As such, it is difficult
    to see how Ms Meek then reaches the  conclusion  that  the  Appellant's
    deportation "could impact on [K] emotionally, physically as well as  on
    her development  and  learning  within  education"  which  "could  then
    continue into her adult life and future relationship".  She  refers  to
    research about the impact on teenage girls  of  growing  up  without  a
    father in their lives.  However, that research article is not  produced
    and therefore I cannot read what Ms Meek says  in  context.   I  cannot
    accept without some underlying evidence that all teenage girls who grow
    up without a father in their lives are affected in  the  way  which  Ms
    Meek describes based on the one article on which she relies.

55. I accept as a possibility that [K] could develop emotional and physical
    effects if the Appellant is deported.  [T]'s  statement  suggests  that
    she did experience some problems when the Appellant was in  prison  (to
    which Ms Meek does not refer) but I do not have any medical evidence or
    evidence from [K]'s school about the impacts.  In any event, [K] is now
    much older.  It is not clear whether [K]'s reaction would be greater or
    lesser as a result of that age difference. I am not  much  assisted  in
    this regard by Ms Meek's evidence.

56. Ms Meek says that [C] and [A] would not be able to  return  to  Nigeria
    with the Appellant because they  do  not  have  accommodation  and  the
    Appellant would not be able to support them.  I accept of  course  that
    they cannot be required to go with the Appellant and, certainly in  the
    short term, given the Appellant's lack of familiarity with  Nigeria,  I
    accept it might be difficult for the family to relocate there.  I  also
    accept that the Appellant and [C] would probably prefer their  children
    to be educated in the UK.  I therefore proceed on the  assumption  that
    if the Appellant were deported, [C], [A] and now [D]  would  remain  in
    the UK.

57. Ms Meek says that the prospect of the Appellant's deportation is having
    an emotional impact on [C].  I do not doubt that this  is  a  stressful
    time for [C].  However, there is no medical  evidence  to  support  any
    suggestion that [C] is not emotionally stable as  Ms  Meek  appears  to
    suggest might be the position if the Appellant were deported.  Although
    [C] says she was depressed when the Appellant was in prison,  there  is
    no evidence of any medical intervention in  that  regard.   Assumptions
    about [C]'s mental state are beyond the competence of Ms Meek  who  has
    no medical qualification and what she says about those implications  is
    speculative in the extreme.

58. I accept that [C] found the Appellant's absence stressful when  he  was
    in prison and that the position is likely to be worse if  there  is  no
    potential end date as there was then.  I accept also that the stress of
    separation from the Appellant may well exacerbate her physical illness,
    particularly her IBS. However, I reiterate that  there  is  no  medical
    evidence to support a suggestion that [C] was emotionally unstable when
    the Appellant was in prison nor that she was not able to care  for  [A]
    for that reason.  I have already noted that [C] may at that  time  have
    had support from her mother then which may not  be  available  now  but
    that is not mentioned either by Ms Meek.  I can therefore  give  little
    weight to Ms Meek's conclusions about [C]'s ability to look  after  [A]
    (and [D]) if the Appellant were deported.

59. Ms Meek's conclusions about the impact on [K] and [A] of a severing  of
    the bond between them depends whether [A] would remain in the UK if the
    Appellant were deported as I have assumed would be the  case.   I  have
    already referred to [T]'s evidence which does not support a  conclusion
    that the relationship between [K] and [A] would  not  continue  if  the
    Appellant were deported, provided of course that [C] and [A] remain  in
    the UK.

60. I give no weight to what Ms Meek says about the risks to the  Appellant
    in Nigeria or the family's concerns about kidnapping.  Ms Meek does not
    refer to any evidence in support and whilst I  am  prepared  to  accept
    that kidnappings do take place in some parts of Nigeria, it  is  beyond
    Ms Meek's expertise to comment on those matters.  I  accept  of  course
    that [C] and the children might worry about what might  happen  to  the
    Appellant  in  Nigeria  and  that  is  a  factor  which  I  take   into
    consideration.

61. Ms Meek's concluding paragraph reads as follows:

         "6.8 Should [the Appellant]  be  deported  to  Nigeria  it  is  the
         professional opinion of the author of this report  that  this  will
         have a detrimental emotional impact on his son  [A].   Should  [the
         Appellant] be deported this will also have a detrimental  emotional
         impact on his daughter [K] as well as a detrimental physical impact
         on [K].  [The Appellant]'s absence will  also  have  a  significant
         emotional and physical impact on his partner [C] which in turn will
         also impact emotionally and physically on their  son  [A].   It  is
         therefore in the best interests of his children that [A] remains in
         this country with his family."

62. I have no problem accepting that the Appellant's deportation would have
    a detrimental emotional impact on [C] and the children.  However, I can
    give little weight to Ms Meek's  other  conclusions.   I  have  already
    noted that Ms Meek has no medical qualifications and it is  beyond  her
    expertise to offer an opinion on mental and physical health impacts  as
    to which there is limited evidence (except in relation to the effect of
    stress on [C]'s IBS - which is very limited - and [T]'s evidence  about
    the impact on [K] when her father was in prison which is unsupported by
    any  medical  opinion).   Moreover,  Ms  Meek  moves  from  an  opinion
    expressed within the report that the  Appellant's  deportation  "could"
    have these effects to a categoric assertion that  they  will  which  is
    unsupported by the body of her report.  I should say though that I have
    no difficulty accepting that  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of  the
    children that the Appellant remain in the UK with them.  I will come on
    to that again below.





Letter from [A]'s school

63. The Appellant produced at the hearing a letter from [A]'s school  dated
    12 March 2019.  That is written by  the  Assistant  Head  Teacher.   It
    reads as follows:


         "Thank you for your letter and for meeting me  yesterday.   It  was
         helpful to hear your concerns about [A].
         I did speak with [A] today who told  me  that  he  sometimes  likes
         school and he spoke positively about three  friends  in  particular
         whom he plays with.  He did  comment  on  a  child  who  makes  bad
         choices and likes to play fight and he could tell me what he should
         do if anything did happen.  He confirmed that  he  should  tell  an
         adult and could name adults that he felt he could talk to.   I  did
         ask him whether anything had happened recently and he told me  that
         it hadn't.
         We also discussed that if you were worried or  had  concerns  about
         [A], to talk directly to the staff  rather  than  approach  parents
         themselves.
         As agreed, I did discuss your concerns  with  the  reception  staff
         team who are going to be keeping a close eye on him.  The staff  do
         see [A] playing with one or two friends and said  that  he  appears
         happy in his play and at school.
         I will talk to [A] again in a few days to check  in  with  him  and
         have asked his teacher to do the same.
         Please do come and talk to me or  Jade  if  you  have  any  further
         concerns."

64. This letter is not particularly supportive of the Appellant's case.  It
    suggests that the Appellant may be exaggerating the problems which  [A]
    has encountered at school.  It also indicates that the school  is  able
    to support [A] and that [A] himself knows what to do if he is  worried.
    It further suggests that the Appellant has intervened in the  situation
    inappropriately by speaking to other parents rather than the school.  I
    do not seek to criticise him for that.  He is worried about his son and
    no doubt thinks he is doing the  right  thing  by  intervening  on  the
    child's behalf.   However,  the  letter  does  not  provide  evidential
    support for the Appellant's case that the effect of deportation on  [A]
    would be unduly harsh because of the problems which [A] is experiencing
    at school albeit that is an additional factor  to  be  weighed  in  the
    balance.

The Appellant's Offence

65. I have  already  summarised  the  index  offence  and  the  Appellant's
    evidence in relation to that offence.  It is also  appropriate  however
    to have regard to the Judge's sentencing remarks which cast a different
    impression of the role which  the  Appellant  played  and  the  reasons
    behind it.  Those read as follows:


         "...Would you stand up please, [AA] and [MK].  In both your cases I
         have read the pre-sentence reports and  noted  their  contents.   I
         treat both of you as men of good character before  the  jury  found
         you guilty.  As far as you [AA]  I  have  also  read  a  number  of
         letters from two members of your family, your  manager,  Mr  Saidu,
         and from a fourth person [KF].  I note their  contents,  but  given
         the sentencing guidelines which I am obliged to follow, I am afraid
         that I can do very little to fulfil the wishes of the writers.
         Both of you acted as willing runners for [MO].  I am satisfied both
         of you did so in the hope of substantial financial gain.  I am also
         satisfied that on the evidence I have heard that  to  some  extent,
         both of you knew the scale of the operation and you played a  vital
         part in the actual supply of drugs,  and  the  taking  of  payment.
         Thus so far as the law is concerned, your part in  the  running  of
         that business was a significant one.  I also note that  neither  of
         you claims then or now to be a drug user or let  alone  an  addict.
         You were caught on camera on a very limited basis in both cases.
         However, in my view, having watched the  footage  more  than  once,
         both of  you  look  to  me  to  be  entirely  comfortable  in  your
         surroundings, and that is not consistent with  you  being  novices.
         From that I infer you both acted as agents for [MO] more often than
         the films showed.
         I am confirmed in that view by other  evidence.   You,  [AA],  were
         able to pay off substantial rent arrears in a short period of  time
         between August and December 2012, and the sum  involved  was  about
         ï¿½3000.  You could have not afforded that without earnings from  the
         drugs trade.
         ...
         I treat both of you as assistants to a dealer who you knew to be in
         a substantial way of business, but not  quite  how  substantial  it
         turned out to be.
         For the  reasons  already  given  your  roles  must  be  considered
         significant ones.  Your cases both belong in the third category  of
         seriousness, identified by the sentencing guidelines,  which  I  am
         obliged  to  follow,  and  do.   It  follows  from  that  that  the
         sentencing range is three  and  a  half  to  seven  years,  with  a
         starting point of four and a half years.   Both  of  you  contested
         these matters and therefore can have no credit for a guilty plea.
         You, [AA], are aged 25.  In your case,  the  sentence  on  each  of
         these counts is one of four and a half years imprisonment, and  the
         qualifying curfew will mean that 176 days will be  counted  towards
         that sentence.
         ...
         In practical terms what that means is that you will serve  half  of
         the sentences that I have passed, and you will  then  be  released.
         Stay out of trouble until the expiry of the  two  periods  and  you
         will hear  no  more  of  this  matter.   Get  into  trouble  again,
         especially in relation to Class A drugs and the  chances  are  that
         you will be recalled to  serve  some  or  all  of  the  outstanding
         balance."

66. I appreciate that the sentence passed was one towards the lower end  of
    the available scale.  Nonetheless, the Court  did  not  accept  on  the
    evidence that the Appellant's role was other than significant and  also
    did not accept that the  motivation  was  other  than  financial  gain,
    contrary to the case which the Appellant has put forward.  I also  note
    that, although the Appellant was released from prison in  August  2015,
    he has remained on licence until more recently (November 2017) and  has
    moreover been aware throughout that time that he faced the prospect  of
    deportation which has provided a  very  significant  incentive  not  to
    reoffend.  On the other hand, he says, and I accept  that  he  has  not
    offended since (as confirmed by his probation officer).  I do not  have
    any evidence that he is seen as posing any or  any  significant  future
    risk to the public.  However, as I come to below, this was  an  offence
    concerning Class A drugs.  There are also other aspects to  the  public
    interest beyond simply a continuing risk to the public.







DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

67. As I observe at [7] above, although the Appellant cannot  benefit  from
    the exceptions in Section 117C due  to  the  length  of  his  sentence,
    nonetheless it is relevant to consider whether he could meet  those  if
    they did apply.

Private Life

68. As I understand the Appellant's case, he does not rely on  his  private
    life as being reason why he cannot be deported.  Indeed, he said  that,
    were it not for his children, he would accept deportation to  his  home
    country.  It is however relevant to the overall proportionality of  the
    deportation decision to consider his background.

69. I begin by accepting that the Appellant came to the UK in 1999 with his
    mother as he says and that he was abandoned by her here in the care  of
    his aunt.  There is evidence in the bundles that the Appellant  was  in
    education here from 2001 to 2004 and some  documents  thereafter  which
    show academic achievements  between  2005  and  2010.     I  accept  as
    genuine the applications which the Respondent has produced.  However, I
    do not accept that those show that the  Appellant  must  have  been  in
    Nigeria when those applications were made.  It appears that  the  first
    application in 2004 (which led to the grant of a visit visa)  was  made
    online and no address is given in Nigeria.  There is  no  documentation
    to show that the visa was used.  The second which was refused indicates
    that the application was submitted via the drop box.  It  may  well  be
    that  the  Appellant's  mother  was  responsible   for   making   these
    applications in an effort to regularise the Appellant's stay.   On  any
    view, however, the Appellant was only a teenager at the time and  there
    is no indication that he was responsible for making  the  applications.
    Even if the applications were not legitimate, therefore,  the  evidence
    does not show that he was involved in their making.  I also observe  in
    passing that I  do  not  consider  as  relevant  the  difficulties  the
    Appellant had when applying for a Nigerian passport and, in particular,
    I accept that he has the date of birth which he says he has and was the
    age he claims to be when he arrived in the UK.

70. The Appellant has therefore been in the UK since the age of  ten  years
    and for about twenty years.  He is now aged thirty-one years.   He  has
    therefore been in the UK for over half his  life.   However,  the  only
    status which he has ever been given in the UK was between 2010 and 2015
    when he was given a residence permit as the spouse of an EEA  national.
    I have no evidence as to when the marriage came to an end  nor  whether
    he remains married to his EEA partner (or where she is living now).  It
    is not suggested that the Appellant retains any EU law  rights  as  the
    family member of an EEA national. Indeed, the Appellant  has  expressly
    disavowed any knowledge of  applications  made  to  the  Respondent  in
    September 2014 and March 2015 for permanent residence  on  this  basis.
    The first of those applications gave rise to a right  of  appeal  which
    was heard in June 2015 and allowed on 12 June  2015  on  the  basis  of
    retained rights of residence.   The Appellant says  that  his  identity
    was used by another individual on that occasion and says that he  could
    not have been the author of these applications or this appeal as he was
    in prison at the time.  The skeleton argument produced for the previous
    Upper Tribunal hearing asserts that the marriage  came  to  an  end  in
    2014.

71. The Appellant probably had leave to enter the UK as a visitor  in  1999
    (although no  evidence  is  produced  of  that)  and  had  a  five-year
    residence permit but on any view has not  been  lawfully  resident  for
    half his life.

72. I accept that the Appellant is socially and  culturally  integrated  in
    the UK.  He was educated in the UK.  There is no evidence that  he  has
    worked here as he was studying  before  his  conviction  and  has  been
    unable to work since due  to  his  immigration  status.   He  is  in  a
    relationship with a British citizen.  She was  born  in  the  UK.   His
    children are all British citizens.

73. I do not however accept that there are very  significant  obstacles  to
    the Appellant's integration in Nigeria.  He was brought up by his aunt.
     I have little information about her and she has since died.   However,
    I assume that she too was Nigerian by birth and may have passed on some
    of the culture to  the  Appellant  (albeit  I  accept  the  Appellant's
    evidence that she did not parent him as well as she might  have  done).
    Furthermore, the Appellant was born and lived in Nigeria until  he  was
    aged ten years.  He can be expected therefore to have some  familiarity
    with the customs of that country.  English is widely spoken  there.   I
    accept that he will never have worked in Nigeria (although I have  also
    noted that he has not worked  in  the  UK  either).   However,  he  has
    educational qualifications which will stand him in good stead to obtain
    employment, albeit his conviction may present  some  obstacles  to  him
    obtaining certain jobs including as a lawyer which  was  obviously  his
    intended career when he was younger.  It would also do so though in the
    UK.  As I have already noted, the Appellant himself said that, were  it
    not for his children, he would have accepted deportation.

74. I accept that the Appellant had a very difficult upbringing.  I  accept
    as true what he said happened to him when he was  a  child.   I  accept
    that he will have found it very  difficult  growing  up  in  a  foreign
    country with little support of a parental nature and in  the  knowledge
    that his mother had abandoned him.   I  accept  his  account  of  being
    abused by a man who was in a position of trust and that this will  have
    had an impact on him emotionally.

75. To his credit, though, the evidence shows that, before the  conviction,
    the Appellant was taking steps to turn his life around.  He studied and
    whilst his studies were not perhaps as successful as  they  might  have
    been because of his circumstances, he has obtained  qualifications  and
    was on track to qualify as a lawyer.

76. I do not accept what the Appellant  says  about  the  reasons  for  his
    offending which led to the conviction for the index  offence.   I  have
    set out the Judge's sentencing remarks which set out the  view  of  the
    Court about the Appellant's motivation for his crime.  That differs  to
    the Appellant's account.  The Appellant's defence of  having  committed
    the crime under duress was not accepted.  The  Appellant's  blaming  of
    his schoolfriend [MO] for  having  involved  him  in  drug  dealing  is
    another example of the Appellant blaming others for his  problems  (for
    example that his solicitors failed to mention  [MO]'s  threats  to  his
    family in mitigation of his crime and that he failed at college because
    of the problems  with  his  marriage  to  [L]  and  having  to  commute
    constantly between Coventry and London to see [K]).

Family Life

77. The Appellant is in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  [C].
    Although, as I have observed, much of [C]'s evidence about  the  effect
    of the Appellant's deportation is focussed on the  children,  I  accept
    that the couple are committed to each  other.   I  accept  that,  as  a
    British citizen, [C] cannot be obliged to return  to  Nigeria.    As  I
    have already indicated, I do not expect that she would go with  him  if
    he were deported (at least not  in  the  short  term)  because  of  her
    concern about the children.

78. There is limited evidence about [C]'s  medical  conditions.   I  accept
    that she has some physical illnesses which,  at  times,  she  finds  it
    difficult to manage.  At the very  least  her  IBS  is  exacerbated  by
    stress.  I also accept that she is assisted when ill by the Appellant's
    support, particularly in caring for the children. She coped when he was
    in prison, but she may not have the same support network now.  I accept
    as true that her relationship with her mother has broken down and  that
    she was apparently living with her mother when  the  Appellant  was  in
    prison.  That evidence is not challenged.  I also accept that she  will
    find it more difficult if the Appellant is deported because there  will
    be no end date to the separation.

79. I also accept that [C] will find it difficult to juggle the demands  of
    working full-time with the care of two young children.  [A] is  now  at
    school but [D] is new born and, once [C]'s maternity leave comes to  an
    end, she may well only be able to return to work on a  part-time  basis
    if at all.  She may have to depend on childcare  arrangements  or  even
    give up work altogether with the consequences that will  have  for  the
    family finances.  However, once the Appellant  finds  work  in  Nigeria
    (which I find he will be able to do - see above), he will  be  able  to
    provide some financial contribution to the family.  I do  not  know  if
    [C]'s relationship with her mother is capable of being reinstated.   If
    it can be, [C]'s mother may be able to help.

80. However, taking all those factors together, and even if the deportation
    of the Appellant to Nigeria were to bring to an  end  the  relationship
    between the Appellant and [C], I do not accept that the effect  on  [C]
    is unduly harsh.  That is a  very  high  threshold.  She  can  maintain
    contact with the Appellant at a distance and there is nothing  to  stop
    her from visiting him there.  The impact on  [C]  will,  I  accept,  be
    harsh and possibly very harsh but I do not accept that the effects meet
    the threshold of being unduly harsh.

81. The focus of the Appellant's case is in any event on the effect on  his
    children.  I have already set out the evidence about them and I do  not
    repeat what I have already said.  I find as a starting point  that  the
    best interests of all three children are to remain in the  UK  and  for
    their father to remain here  with  them.   Whilst  that  is  a  primary
    consideration, it is not the only consideration and not  paramount.   I
    do though give that factor weight when considering the impact  on  [K],
    [A] and [D].

82. I also accept that the children could not be expected to go to  Nigeria
    with the Appellant.  In the case of [K], she does  not  live  with  the
    Appellant and her mother, [T],  is  not  in  a  relationship  with  the
    Appellant.  If she went to  Nigeria  with  the  Appellant,  that  would
    separate her from her mother.  It would be unduly harsh for her  to  go
    to Nigeria.  The position is less clear-cut in relation to [A] and  [D]
    as whether it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  them  to  leave  with  the
    Appellant would  depend  on  the  choices  made  by  their  parents  in
    particular [C].  However, as I have  already  indicated,  I  would  not
    expect [C] to go with the Appellant at least in the short term.  She is
    British and apparently not even  of  Nigerian  descent.   Further,  the
    children are both British and I have found that it would  be  in  their
    best interests to remain in the UK.  I note also  that  the  Respondent
    conceded before Judge Swaney that it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    children to go to Nigeria with the Appellant and I therefore proceed on
    the basis that they would remain  in  the  UK  without  him  if  he  is
    deported.

83. There is no evidence that the Appellant has lived on a full-time  basis
    with [K].  I have already explained why I cannot accept some of what Ms
    Meek says about the impact on [K] including  because  it  misapprehends
    the factual position.  Nonetheless, I accept that [K] has a strong bond
    with her father and sees him regularly and  frequently.   Although  she
    did not see him during the time when he was in  prison,  I  have  noted
    [T]'s evidence about the impact which [K]'s separation from her  father
    had at that time.  However, that  evidence  is  not  supported  by  any
    medical evidence that the problems were particularly  acute  and  could
    not be managed with appropriate support from [T] and [K]'s school.

84. Probably the greatest impact is likely  to  be  on  [A]  for  whom  the
    Appellant acts as a full-time carer (when [A] is  not  at  school).   I
    accept that [A] has a very strong bond with the Appellant as a  result.
    The Appellant was able to give me examples of the anxiety caused to [A]
    has when the Appellant is not  there.   [C]  says  that  she  finds  it
    difficult to settle [A] in the Appellant's absence.  Nonetheless, there
    is no evidence that [A] was significantly impacted by  the  Appellant's
    imprisonment.  I appreciate that he was younger then and was  not  used
    to living with his father.  There is no doubt that separation  will  be
    more difficult for him as a result of having  had  his  father  in  his
    life.  I take into account what Ms Meek  says  about  the  support  [A]
    derives from his father.  I also accept that it is the Appellant rather
    than [C] who is involved in activities  with  [A]  because  [C]  works.
    However, [A] will continue to  have  his  mother's  support.    I  have
    already observed that the Appellant's account of the problems which [A]
    is having at school is  undermined  to  some  extent  by  the  school's
    letter.  In any event, it is clear from that letter that  [A]'s  school
    is also supportive of him and will be willing and  able  to  assist  in
    supporting him through a difficult time.

85. In relation to [D], I had very limited evidence beyond the fact of  her
    birth and the complications of that birth.  That is unsurprising  given
    her age.  She will not yet be as aware as [A] of her parents.  I accept
    though that deportation of the Appellant would  effectively  mean  that
    she would be unable to build a close relationship with her  father.   I
    have already noted that [C] is likely to find it  difficult  to  manage
    with childcare also in his absence.

86. One of the factors on which reliance has been placed by  the  Appellant
    is the breakdown of the relationship between [K] and her  half-siblings
    if he is deported.  He says that he is the common  link  and  that  the
    children's mothers would have no incentive to maintain that contact  if
    he were not present. I do not accept that.  [T]'s  evidence  recognises
    the value to [K] of continuing the relationship with her  half-brother.
    [C]  has  been  willing  to  accept  [K]'s   regular   weekend   visits
    notwithstanding she is not [C]'s child.  The Appellant  says  that  the
    contact would not be retained if he were not there to  go  and  collect
    [K] but I was told that [T] and [K] live about thirty minutes  away  by
    bus from the home where [C] and the Appellant live.  [K]  is  now  aged
    thirteen and could probably  travel  alone  if  there  were  logistical
    problems with picking her up.

87. Taking all of the above factors together, and taking  into  account  my
    finding as to what is in the best interests of the children, I  am  not
    satisfied that there is sufficient evidence  that  the  effect  of  the
    Appellant's deportation will be unduly harsh.  The children will remain
    in the UK with their respective mothers.   Their  separation  from  the
    Appellant will undoubtedly be  harsh.   It  may  even  be  very  harsh.
    However, the factors relied upon are no more than those which would  be
    involved for any child faced with deportation of a parent.   I  do  not
    accept that the evidence shows  that  the  very  high  threshold  which
    applies is met (see KO (Nigeria)).

Very Compelling Circumstances Over and Above the Exceptions

88. As I have already noted, it would be insufficient, in  any  event,  for
    the  Appellant  to  meet  the  exceptions.   Taking  into  account   my
    conclusions as to those exceptions, therefore, I move  on  to  consider
    whether there are very compelling circumstances over  and  above  those
    exceptions which would render the  decision  to  deport  the  Appellant
    disproportionate.  In so doing, I look at all the factors both for  and
    against the Appellant adopting the balance sheet approach advocated  in
    Hesham Ali.

Factors for the Appellant

89. Although I have found that there are no very significant obstacles  for
    the Appellant to his integration in Nigeria, there is no doubt that  he
    will find it difficult to adjust to life there.  He has been away  from
    the country for twenty years.  He has never lived there as an adult.  I
    accept he has no family or friends there and will, in effect,  have  to
    start his life over.  Those are hardships which it is  appropriate  for
    me to take into account.  Although I have very limited  evidence  about
    the Appellant's  life  in  the  UK  beyond  his  family  life  and  the
    educational achievements  which  he  has  made,  there  is  undoubtedly
    interference also with his private life built up here.

90. When looking at his private life, it is also appropriate for me to take
    into account the Appellant's background when growing up which  he  says
    is relevant to the reasons for him making bad choices  leading  to  his
    offending.  I have already dealt with this and I do not repeat  what  I
    have said.  I accept that his background and difficult  upbringing  may
    have had some impact on his offending and may go some way to explaining
    it, but that consideration is limited by the fact  that  the  Appellant
    was showing signs of having turned his life around before he  committed
    the index offence.  I can give  this  factor  some  weight  but  not  a
    significant amount of weight.

91. In relation to the Appellant's family life, this is where the  greatest
    interference arises.  Although I have not accepted that the  effect  of
    deportation will be unduly harsh for either [C] or his children, I have
    already set out the hardship which  the  Appellant's  deportation  will
    cause.  I do not repeat the evidence or my  findings  in  that  regard.
    Those  effects  are  as  I  have  accepted  harsh,  even  very   harsh,
    particularly in relation to the children.   I have  accepted  that  the
    children's best interests are to have their father with them in the UK.



The Public Interest

92. On the  other  side  of  the  equation  lies  the  public  interest  in
    deportation.  I have accepted that the  Appellant  has  not  reoffended
    since his release from prison in August 2015.   That  though  can  only
    take him so far.  First, he was on licence for part of the period since
    then and,  even  after  his  licence  expired,  he  was  aware  of  the
    Respondent's intention to deport him and therefore had every  incentive
    not to reoffend.  I do not suggest that he is likely to do so again  in
    the future.  I have no evidence to that effect.

93. However, second, and in any event, the risk of reoffending is only  one
    facet of the public interest in deportation.  I have  to  take  account
    also of the deterrent effect of deportation and the expectation of  the
    public that foreign criminals will be dealt with  appropriately.   That
    is the more so in relation to crimes involving the supply  of  Class  A
    drugs which have a significant impact on society, in particular on  the
    young and other vulnerable persons who become addicted to them.

94. The Appellant sought to mitigate his responsibility for the offence  by
    suggesting that he was the subject of influence and duress  from  [MO].
    As I have already observed, that part of his case is undermined by  the
    Judge's sentencing remarks.  The evidence  shows  that  the  motivation
    behind the Appellant's offence was personal, financial  gain,  that  he
    was a willing participant and was involved in  a  substantial  business
    dealing drugs; also, that he was not a  novice.   This  was  a  serious
    offence as reflected in the sentence.

95. The Appellant has expressed remorse for his offending. He says  in  his
    statement at [SB/4] that he has learned about the  impacts  of  selling
    drugs not just for the user but also for society as a whole.   However,
    his remorse also has to be considered in the  context  of  him  blaming
    others for his commission of the crime, particularly [MO].  He said  to
    me in his submissions that he was "stupid to fall for it" ([MO]  taking
    advantage as he  saw  it).   Whilst  I  accept  therefore  that  he  is
    remorseful, it is still unclear that he accepts the attribution of  his
    responsibility  for  the  supply  of  drugs  which  emerges  from   the
    sentencing remarks.



Balancing Assessment

96. I take together all of the factors in the Appellant's favour.   I  have
    particular regard to my finding that the Appellant's deportation on his
    family will have harsh and even very harsh effects  on  them.   I  also
    take into account  my  finding  that  it  is  in  the  children's  best
    interests that the Appellant be allowed to remain with them in the  UK.
    However, the Appellant's  offence  was  a  serious  one  involving  the
    dealing of Class A drugs.  The Judge's sentencing remarks  reflect  the
    Appellant's involvement in that offence.  Although he is remorseful, he
    continues to blame others for involving him in the offence  and  it  is
    not clear that, even now, he fully accepts his role  in  that  offence.
    Whilst accepting that  the  Appellant  has  not  reoffended  since  his
    release from prison and that there is no evidence that he is likely  to
    do so in future, bearing  in  mind  the  other  facets  of  the  public
    interest to which I have referred, the nature and  seriousness  of  the
    offence and the Appellant's role in it, when  the  public  interest  in
    deportation is balanced against the impacts on the Appellant's  private
    and family life and that of his family members,  I  conclude  that  the
    decision  to  deport  is  not  disproportionate.   There  are  no  very
    compelling circumstances, over and  above  the  exceptions  in  Section
    117C, such as to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in  the  Appellant's
    deportation.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Symes, Counsel instructed by Westkin Associates

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) on 12 October  2018  to  uphold  AA's  (the  claimant's)
    appeal, on human rights  grounds,  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision of 16 June 2017 to refuse his human rights claim and to deport
    him.

 2. The Secretary of State seeks to deport the claimant on the  basis  that
    he is a foreign criminal within the meaning  of  UK  Borders  Act  2007
    section 32 and liable to automatic deportation.

 3. The claimant is a national of Nigeria born in January 1988 who  entered
    the UK in 1999 with his mother. She quickly abandoned him, left the  UK
    and he has no contact with her.  In February 2010 he was granted a five
    years' residence card on the basis of his marriage to an EEA national.

 4. On 29 November 2013 he was convicted of two charges  of  conspiracy  to
    supply controlled drugs and sentenced to 4 ï¿½  years'  imprisonment  for
    offences committed in 2012.

 5. The claimant's further applications for a permanent residence card were
    unsuccessful and on 21 April 2017 he was  notified  of  a  decision  to
    deport him in relation to which his representations were rejected on 16
    June 2017.

 6. The claimant has two children who are British citizens:  a  daughter  K
    aged 12, who lives with his former partner, and a son  A  aged  4.  The
    claimant lives with A and A's mother C who is expecting  another  child
    by the claimant.

The Determination of 12 October 2018

 7. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  (FTTJ)  summarises  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision at para 8 before summarising the evidence given by the
    claimant and his partner at the hearing between paras 11  and  22.  She
    summarises the competing submissions she heard at paras 23 to 38 and at
    paras 39 to 43 sets  out  the  relevant  immigration  rules  and  their
    effect. She summarises further  documentary  evidence  at  paras  45-57
    which included: favourable prison  records;  a  report  by  independent
    social worker Julie Meek of 27 September  2018;  and  some  documentary
    evidence supporting the claimant having been at school in the  UK  from
    at  least  2001  and  having  successfully  completed  a  law   related
    university foundation course in 2008. Between paras 58 and 81 the  FtTJ
    set out her findings and reasons.

 8. The FtTJ  noted  positive  reports  about  the  claimant's  engagement,
    conduct and progress on courses he undertook in prison with a  view  to
    addressing his offending  behaviour  and  improving  his  prospects  of
    employment. At para 47 she  accepted  information  from  his  probation
    officer to the effect that he had addressed  his  offending  behaviour,
    recognised his triggers and  high-risk  situations.  The  claimant  had
    expressed remorse to his probation officer who had  no  concerns  about
    his lifestyle or associates.

 9. At paras 48-55 the FtTJ considered in some detail an independent social
    work report from Ms Meek who found that both of the claimant's children
    have an attachment to him. His son was brought to visit the claimant in
    prison from two weeks after his birth.  The  claimant's  absence  could
    impact on his daughter emotionally, physically and  educationally.  She
    noted the importance of the presence  of  a  father  during  the  early
    years, particularly for a boy, and she  did  not  consider  that  Skype
    contact could permit the same quality of contact currently enjoyed.  Ms
    Meek concluded that deportation  would  have  a  detrimental  emotional
    impact on his daughter and on his son and the impact on the  son  would
    be exacerbated by the emotional and physical impact on  his  mother  of
    the absence of her partner.

10. At  paras  61-62  the  FtTJ  identified  the  public  interest  in  the
    claimant's deportation, noting that he had been convicted of conspiracy
    to supply the class A drugs crack cocaine and  heroin.  She  recognised
    the harmful consequences of supplying such drugs, that  the  claimant's
    sentence was at the level which means that he is liable to  deportation
    unless there are very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  the
    private and family life exceptions in section 117 C, although she  also
    noted that there was not a pattern of such offending. At  para  63  she
    gave little weight  to  the  Secretary  of  State's  delay  in  seeking
    deportation, noting departmental unawareness of his situation to  which
    the claimant may have contributed by obtaining a Nigerian passport with
    the wrong date of birth on it. She concluded at para 64  that  she  was
    required  to  place  significant  weight  on  the  public  interest  in
    deportation in all the circumstances.

11. At paras 65-68 there is a discussion of the claimant's credibility, but
    we say no more about it because there is no ground of  appeal  in  that
    regard.

12. It was not in dispute before the FtTJ that it would be unduly harsh for
    the claimant's children and partner to accompany him to Nigeria as  the
    FtTJ noted at para 69.

13. At para 70 the FtTJ concluded that it would be in the best interests of
    the children to continue to enjoy their relationship with their  father
    and it would be unduly harsh for them to remain here without him. K  is
    on the cusp of adolescence at the age of 12 with implications  for  her
    development should her father be deported as Ms Meek had explained.  At
    para 71 she noted Ms Meek's views on the impact on the 4 year-old A. At
    para 72 she gave significant weight to  the  relationship  between  the
    claimant's children which would be lost in his  absence  and  concluded
    that it was in their best interests that it should continue. At para 73
    she observes that C might have to give  up  work  as  a  nurse  if  the
    claimant cannot provide child care for A. At  para  74  she  noted  the
    claimant's contribution to his son's education and activities.  In  the
    absence of the claimant this may undermine A's ability  to  participate
    in some of his activities.  At  para  75  she  considered  C's  medical
    condition which can at times undermine her ability to care for her son,
    and noted that the situation would become more difficult when her  baby
    is born.

14. At para 76 the FtTJ noted C's low mood when the claimant was in  prison
    and when she now contemplates a life without him. C feels that her mood
    will prejudice her daily functioning so that she may be unable to  meet
    the needs of her son consequent on the loss of his father. The boy will
    suffer  a  considerable  loss  and  will  need  considerable  emotional
    support. For these reasons, the FtTJ concluded that it would be  unduly
    harsh for C to remain in the UK without the claimant.

15. At para 77, the FtTJ found that the claimant cannot  meet  Exception  1
    based on his private life.

16. The FtTJ accepted the claimant's evidence that he had been raped  by  a
    football coach which contributed to his marriage  to  an  EEA  national
    being short and unhappy. The FtTJ considered this to have  had  a  huge
    impact on him as she explained in para 78. At para  12  she  gives  the
    impression that this may have occurred around 2010, but the  claimant's
    statement of 17 May 2017 suggested that it was in or before 2003.

17. At para 79 she accepted the claimant's  account  of  the  circumstances
    including that he was vulnerable when he committed the  drugs  offences
    and susceptible to the bad influence of an associate.

18. Para 80 is in these terms:

         "80. The claimant's conduct in prison and  since  his  release  has
         been positive and the evidence demonstrates that  he  engaged  with
         his sentence plan and took steps to address his offending behaviour
         and to obtain skills he could use in the community  after  release.
         He talks about learning how to make better decisions and to be more
         assertive, two key factors in his offending. He also described  how
         a drug awareness course taught him about the wider impacts of  drug
         dealing within the community. The claimant has not re-offended  and
         his personal circumstances are now significantly different to  what
         they were when he committed the offence. The claimant is now living
         with his partner and son and his partner  is  pregnant  with  their
         second child. His partner is employed as a nurse and  he  enjoys  a
         stable family life. This contrasts significantly with the  life  he
         was leading at the time of his offending. I accept the claimant has
         taken positive steps to reduce his risk of reoffending and that  it
         is unlikely that he will reoffend in the future."

    At para 81, which we reproduce in full at our para 48 below,  the  FtTJ
    gave particular weight to the findings that Exception 2  was  met,  the
    likely loss  of  relationship  between  the  claimant's  children,  the
    contribution made by the claimant's background to  his  offending,  the
    steps he had  taken  to  address  his  offending  and  changes  in  his
    circumstances which she deemed to reduce the risk of  his  reoffending.
    It was these considerations which the FtTJ determined amounted to  very
    compelling circumstances  over  and  above  the  exceptions  so  as  to
    outweigh the public interest in deportation.

The challenge

19. Within 11 enumerated paragraphs it seems to  us  that  there  are  four
    grounds of appeal,  set  out  in  paras  5-8  of  the  application  for
    permission to appeal.

        .     It is said that the  FtTJ  erred  by  giving  weight  to  her
          assessment that Exception 2 in section 117C (or Immigration  Rule
          399(a) and (b)) could be met. The suggestion is  that  since  the
          exceptions cannot apply where the sentence  is  in  excess  of  4
          years then the only relevant issue was whether  there  were  very
          compelling reasons over and above the exceptions in section  117C
          with reference to NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home
          Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662;

        .    secondly, that the FtTJ failed to have adequate regard to  the
          very considerable weight accorded by  Parliament  to  the  public
          interest in the claimant's deportation and that findings  on  the
          issue of undue harshness for the claimant's partner and  children
          had "infected" the decision as to whether there were  exceptional
          circumstances over and above the exceptions and there had been  a
          failure  to  consider  state  support  which  may  alleviate  the
          circumstances. This somewhat discursive ground of appeal contains
          two sentences which may be significant:

             "It is submitted that the FtTJ's  error  and  findings  as  to
             whether the claimant's deportation would be unduly  harsh  for
             the  claimant's  partner  and  children  has  infected   [her]
             subsequent findings in  respect  to  whether  there  are  very
             compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  the   exceptions,
             paragraph 398 (c). In any event it is submitted that the  FtTJ
             has erred in finding that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  under
             either 399(a) or (b) for the claimant to be deported  even  if
             his sentence had fallen below the four year threshold  as  the
             reasons stated at [70] to [76] would  apply  in  almost  every
             case."

        .   thirdly, the Secretary of State contends that the FtTJ erred in
          taking account of the  claimant's  personal  background  when  he
          offended, on the basis that historical circumstances were not  in
          the  scope  of  the  material  which  might  give  rise  to  very
          compelling circumstances and fell to be considered  only  in  the
          criminal proceedings. Only current circumstances can be relevant.

        .   fourthly, the judge had erred as there was no foundation in the
          evidence for concluding that on the  claimant's  deportation  his
          children by different mothers would not have  contact  with  each
          other; this could not amount to very compelling circumstances; no
          evidence was available to support suggestions that the claimant's
          partner and son suffered medical conditions; regard had been  had
          to the claimant addressing his offending but it was not clear how
          this could amount to very compelling circumstances.

Submissions for the Secretary of State

20. Mr Tufan submitted that since the sentence was  of  4  ï¿½  years,  there
    required to be very compelling circumstances if the appeal to  the  FtT
    was to succeed.  Thereafter, his submissions were not entirely faithful
    to the grounds of  appeal  but,  as  we  understood  his  position,  he
    contended  that  weight  had   been   given   to   perfectly   ordinary
    circumstances which, given what was said in the  Supreme  Court  in  KO
    (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC  53,
    at para 27, were not capable of amounting  to  undue  harshness,  still
    less very compelling circumstances over and above that exception.

21. There was no diagnosis of autism in respect of the claimant's  son  and
    even if there was, such a condition is nothing out of the ordinary.  If
    the claimant contributed to his children's  education,  that  was  just
    normal parenting and nothing extraordinary.  There  was  nothing  which
    amounted to undue harshness, let alone very compelling circumstances.

22. The Secretary of State's essential point, to be found within the second
    ground of appeal as we have described it above, seemed to be  that  the
    FtTJ had erred in finding that it would be unduly harsh for the partner
    and children to remain in the UK without the claimant and  this  had  a
    material  impact  on  the  conclusion  reached  that  there  were  very
    compelling circumstances so that the error was material.

Submissions for the claimant

23. Mr Symes adopted his  skeleton  argument.  In  response  to  the  first
    ground, he submitted that the Secretary of State misunderstood what was
    said by the Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan). Properly understood,  the
    Court of Appeal's judgment supported the approach taken by the FtTJ.

24. The FtTJ had conducted a careful analysis of all of the facts  and  had
    properly reached a conclusion as to where the  best  interests  of  the
    children lay. It was perfectly clear that the FtTJ had  understood  the
    nature and gravity of the offence and the weight given to a sentence of
    such a length in the 2002 Act and associated rules.

25. There was nothing  in  the  "social  services"  point  because  it  was
    authoritatively recognised that state support is not a  substitute  for
    care within a family: R (on the application of HH) v  Westminster  City
    Magistrates' Court [2012] 1 AC 338 at para 69.

26. There was no temporal restriction on the  circumstances  which  can  be
    considered in the context of section 117C (6) and Immigration Rule  398
    (c).

27. There is an evidential basis for the conclusion reached that the  half-
    siblings would lose contact if the claimant is deported.

28. In reality, the Secretary of State's approach was to mount a  disguised
    irrationality argument.

Analysis

29. The 2002 Act provides in section 117 C:

         "117C Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals
          (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
          interest.
          (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
          the greater is the public interest in deportation of the
          criminal.
          (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
          sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
          public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
          Exception 2 applies.
          (4) Exception 1 applies where-
          (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most
          of C's life,
          (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
          Kingdom, and
          (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration
          into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.
          (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
          relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and
          subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the
          effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly
          harsh.
          (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
          period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
          interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
          circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
          2.
          (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
          into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision
          to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason
          for the decision was the offence or offences for which the
          criminal has been convicted."

30. Immigration Rules 398, 399 and 399A now provide:

         "398. Where  a  person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
         contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 ... and

         (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;
         (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months;
         or
         (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the public interest because, in the view of  the
         Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or they
         are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for  the
         law, the Secretary of State in assessing that claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.
         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -
         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
         with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and
         (i) the child is a British Citizen; or
         (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least the  7
         years immediately preceding the date of the  immigration  decision;
         and in either case
         (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in  the  country
         to which the person is to be deported; and
         (c) it would be unduly harsh for the child  to  remain  in  the  UK
         without the person who is to be deported; or
         (d) the person has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled in the
         UK, and
         (i)  the  relationship  was  formed  at  a  time  when  the  person
         (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration status  was
         not precarious; and
         (ii) it would be unduly harsh for  that  partner  to  live  in  the
         country  to  which  the  person  is  to  be  deported,  because  of
         compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those   described   in
         paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and
         (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in the UK
         without the person who is to be deported.
         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)  applies
         if -
         (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his
         life; and
         (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
         (c) there would be very significant obstacles  to  his  integration
         into the country to which it is proposed he is deported."

31. In NA (Pakistan) the Court of Appeal explained  how  the  exception  in
    117C (6) can work at paras 29 and 30 of its  opinion.  The  context  to
    this passage is that the Court  of  Appeal  considered  that  the  very
    compelling circumstances exception ought to be applied equally to those
    in the medium bracket if the facts fell outside those  exceptions,  but
    the exceptions were relevant also to  consideration  of  the  level  of
    compelling circumstances for the most serious offenders:

         "29......The phrase used in section 117C (6), in paragraph  398  of
         the 2014 rules and which we have held is to be  read  into  section
         117C(3) does not mean that a foreign criminal facing deportation is
         altogether disentitled from seeking  to  rely  on  matters  falling
         within the scope of the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and
         2  when  seeking  to  contend  that  "there  are  very   compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2". As we have indicated above, a foreign criminal is  entitled  to
         rely upon such matters, but he would need to be able  to  point  to
         features of his case of a kind mentioned in Exceptions 1 and 2 (and
         in paragraphs 399 or 399A of the 2014 rules), or  features  falling
         outside the circumstances described in those exceptions  and  those
         paragraphs, which made his claim  based  on  article  8  especially
         strong.

         30.  In  the  case  of  a  serious  offender  who  could  point  to
         circumstances in his own case which could be said to correspond  to
         the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and  2,  but  where  he
         could only just succeed in  such  an  argument,  it  would  not  be
         possible to describe his situation  as  involving  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.  One might describe that as a bare case of the kind described in
         Exceptions 1 or 2.  On the other hand, if he could point to factors
         identified in  the  descriptions  of  Exceptions  1  and  2  of  an
         essentially compelling kind in support of an Article 8 claim, going
         well beyond what would be necessary to make out a bare case of  the
         kind described in Exceptions 1  and  2,  they  could  in  principle
         constitute "very compelling circumstances,  over  and  above  those
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2" whether taken by themselves or  in
         conjunction with other factors relevant to application  of  Article
         8."

32. The claimant was entitled to rely either on  features  which  may  fall
    within the  exceptions,  or  features  beyond  their  scope,  or  both.
    Accordingly, we do not consider that the FtTJ made the  error  proposed
    in the first ground of appeal.

33. Turning to the third ground of appeal  which  contends  that  the  FtTJ
    erred by taking account of circumstances which may have contributed  to
    the claimant offending, we do not consider that the  terms  of  section
    117 C or rule 398(c) preclude taking account of such considerations. We
    note one example where it can be relevant with reference to R  (Kiarie)
    v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 42 at para 55,
    where Lord Wilson indicated that it would be legitimate to consider the
    risk of re-offending amongst other factors when considering  the  issue
    of very compelling circumstances. In so far as the FtTJ may have  taken
    account of the claimant having been raped and this being  part  of  the
    context in which he offended we consider that, in  principle,  she  was
    entitled to take  this  into  account  when  considering  the  risk  of
    reoffending. Whilst it may  be  of  limited  weight  given  the  multi-
    dimensional  aspects  to  the  public  interest  in  deporting  foreign
    criminals, low risk is relevant to one of those aspects; the protection
    of  the  public  from  further  offending  by  the  person   concerned.
    Accordingly, we do not consider the FtTJ necessarily to have  erred  in
    this respect.


34. However, we also consider that only very limited weight could attach to
    the appellant's vulnerability insofar as based on his having been raped
    whether that occurred in or before 2003 or  in  2010.   His  qualifying
    offences  were  not  crimes  of  violence  against  his  attacker   but
    involvement in drug supplying years later, each  of  the  two  offences
    occurring over almost four months between  August  and  December  2012.
    Insofar as the claimant may have been influenced by another person into
    assisting him to supply drugs  it  could  have  little  weight  as  the
    sentencing judge accepted that the claimant had been running drugs  for
    someone else. The judge also noted that the claimant  must  have  known
    the scale of the operation he was involved in and  made  a  substantial
    amount of money in doing so.


35. So far as the fourth ground of appeal is concerned, we do not  consider
    that the FtTJ meant that the general desirability of two  half-siblings
    continuing to develop a relationship, and that the  likelihood  of  the
    relationship disintegrating in the claimant's absence was of  itself  a
    compelling circumstance. It was a factor she was entitled to take  into
    account in assessing the best interests of children and  add  into  the
    overall assessment for what it  was  worth.  Whilst  we  may  not  have
    accorded as much weight to this consideration as it  appears  that  the
    FtTJ did, it cannot be said that it was of no  weight  in  the  overall
    assessment. There was evidence in the claimant's statement that in  his
    absence their relationship was bound to  collapse.   It  could  in  any
    event be legitimately inferred that in the absence of the claimant, who
    was the common denominator between an otherwise unconnected partner and
    ex-partner  who  were  the  respective   mothers   of   the   children,
    arrangements would not be made for the children to see each other.



36. There was also evidence in the  statement  of  the  claimant's  current
    partner C that she has been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and
    adenomysis,  both  of  which  she  describes  as  being   painful   and
    debilitating. The Secretary of State's refusal letter accepted evidence
    that a medical investigation was ongoing as to whether his  son  A  has
    autism, albeit the view was expressed that  even  in  the  event  of  a
    diagnosis, this would not be considered material  on  the  question  of
    very compelling circumstances. Accordingly, we do not find ground 4  to
    demonstrate any material error.


37. Before turning to ground of appeal 2, we acknowledge that there is some
    force in counsel's submission that the Secretary  of  State's  approach
    seems to  be  that  the  decision  reached  was  one  which  could  not
    reasonably have been reached on the facts, without the foundation of  a
    ground of appeal to that effect.

38. On ground 2, we reject the contention that the FtTJ failed to have  due
    regard to the weight of the public interest in deportation in this case
    having regard to the terms of those parts of her determination which we
    have summarised at para 10 above.

39. It is self-evident that state  support  cannot  substitute  for  family
    support of the kind which existed between the claimant, his  partner  C
    and his son A, but its potential mitigation would have been a  relevant
    consideration in evaluating whether the  deportation  of  the  claimant
    would be unduly harsh for his partner and son and we  do  not  consider
    that the sentence seized on by Mr Symes from HH demonstrates otherwise.
    However, we do not consider this omission to have great materiality.

40. Within ground 2 there is said to have been  an  error  of  law,  namely
    determining that it would be unduly  harsh  on  his  children  and  his
    partner, in  the  circumstances  found  by  the  FtTJ,  to  deport  the
    claimant.

41. Taking the circumstances at their highest, the situation was  that  the
    claimant has a daughter aged 12 by a former partner and he is  involved
    in his daughter's life and makes a positive contribution. He lives with
    a partner who is a British citizen and they have a son aged  4  with  a
    baby expected. His partner has IBS and adenomysis and felt low when  he
    was in prison as  she  could  be  expected  to  be  on  the  claimant's
    deportation which would have implications for their son.  However,  she
    is able to work as a nurse, albeit the claimant facilitates  her  doing
    so by taking their son to and from school, and his absence  could  mean
    that she would have to give up work. We note, at para 4.5 of Ms  Meek's
    report, that C told the social worker that she could not go to  Nigeria
    as her family is here. The claimant is involved in his son's  life  and
    supports him in his activities and education and  the  absence  of  the
    claimant would have a negative impact. Ms Meek found that both children
    have an attachment with their father. Should he be deported his absence
    could impact on his daughter emotionally, physically as well as on  her
    development and education. It would have a detrimental emotional impact
    on his son and it would have a  detrimental  emotional  impact  on  his
    daughter, and in her case a physical impact  which  Ms  Meek  does  not
    justify. All of which led Ms Meek to conclude, as the FtTJ did, that it
    is in the best interests of the children for the claimant to remain.

42. We note the judgment of the Supreme Court in KO  (Nigeria)  where  Lord
    Carnwath observed at para 23 that "One  is  looking  for  a  degree  of
    harshness going beyond what would necessarily be involved for any child
    faced with the deportation of a parent" and  at  para  27  he  endorsed
    judicial commentary on Exception 2 in 117 C (5):
         "27 Authoritative guidance as to the meaning of "unduly harsh" in
         this context was given by the Upper Tribunal (McCloskey J President
         and Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins) in MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2015] INLR 563 , para 46, a
         decision given on 15 April 2015. They referred to the "evaluative
         assessment" required of the tribunal:
             "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh'
             does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable
             or merely difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more
             elevated threshold. 'Harsh' in this context, denotes something
             severe, or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant or
             comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb 'unduly'
             raises an already elevated standard still higher.
                    ..."

43. We accept that on the analysis of the Court of Appeal in NA  (Pakistan)
    it would be possible to meet the very compelling  circumstance  without
    meeting the tests in Exception 1 and  2.  However,  in  this  case  the
    FtTJ's approach was first to consider Exception 2 and she found that it
    was met in the case of both his children and his partner. It was to the
    claimant's credit that he took advantage of the  resources  in  prison,
    behaved well and the  FtTJ  considered  him  to  present  low  risk  of
    reoffending. However, such circumstances would not of  themselves  have
    taken the claimant very far.

44.  Accordingly, we see some force in the Secretary of State's  contention
    that if the finding on Exception 2 was erroneous it was indeed material
    albeit the ground of appeal uses somewhat different terminology, namely
    that the finding infected all further consideration.

45. We go on to note what the Judge  herself  records  as  the  Appellant's
    submissions about the very compelling circumstances which arise in this
    case at [34] to [37] of the decision:

         "[34] The very compelling circumstances on which it is  relied  are
         set out in the skeleton argument.  In  particular,  the  likelihood
         that the relationship the appellant's two children  currently  have
         with each other would break down in  the  appellant's  absence  was
         significant.  It is the appellant who is the common factor  in  the
         half brother and sister having a relationship.  Their mothers  have
         no relationship with each other and if the appellant  were  not  in
         the United Kingdom would have no interest in ensuring the  children
         could remain in  contact.   In  addition,  the  children  would  be
         without any means of finding out about their  Nigerian  background.
         The appellant does not have any other family members in the  United
         Kingdom who could fill this gap  for  them  in  his  absence.   The
         report of the independent social worker  highlights  the  potential
         detriment to the children if the appellant is not present in  their
         lives.

          [35]    The appellant's personal history including physical  abuse
         by his uncle and sexual abuse by his football coach are significant
         and compelling.

         [36] Mr Symes  relied  on  the  respondent's  delay  in  initiating
         deportation proceedings pointing out that it  was  not  until  four
         years  after  his  conviction.   The  delay   has   permitted   the
         appellant's  family  ties  to  become  stronger  and  he  has   not
         reoffended.  Moreover, he has distanced himself from  the  life  he
         was leading prior to his conviction.  Mr Symes submitted  that  the
         delay is capable of reducing the public interest in deportation.

         [37] In respect of the appellant's offence  Mr  Symes  acknowledged
         that a sentence of more than  four  years  puts  him  in  the  most
         serious category, however, submitted that  his  sentence  puts  him
         just over the four-year threshold.

         [38]  Mr  Symes  submitted  that  taken  together  the  appellant's
         circumstances can properly be  described  as  very  compelling  and
         asked me to allow the appeal."

46. Notwithstanding that the sentence was not much more than 4  years,  the
    claimant still required to meet the criteria in section 117C (6) as  it
    has been judicially interpreted. The Judge gave "little weight" to  the
    delay because she accepted that the respondent may have been unaware of
    the appellant's conviction due to the identity issue ([63]).   We  have
    already dealt with  the  relevance  of  the  personal  history  of  the
    appellant, the salient features of which had arisen a number  of  years
    before and were unconnected with the offending.

47. Although of course the Judge was entitled to take into account  factors
    such as the lack of reoffending since release,  as  the  Judge  herself
    observes at [62], there are other considerations which weigh in  favour
    of the public interest such as the nature of the offence and  the  harm
    caused to society by drugs.

48. The remaining factors bearing  on  the  Article  8  assessment  in  the
    appellant's favour are therefore the  impacts  on  the  family  as  the
    appellant's  representative  had  submitted  and  the  Judge  accepted.
    Without finding that Exception 2 was met, we do not  consider  that  it
    was open to the FtTJ to find  that  there  were,  in  this  case,  very
    compelling circumstances over and above.  We  are  reinforced  in  that
    view by what is said by the Judge at [81] of the decision as follows:

      "Having considered all the factors above I find that  the  appellant's
      particular circumstances  are  very  compelling  over  and  above  the
      exceptions to deportation  and  that  they  outweigh  the  significant
      public interest in deportation.  I have placed particular weight on my
      findings that the appellant would have satisfied paragraph 399(a)  and
      (b) had those provisions applied; the impact on  the  ability  of  the
      appellant's children to continue to  have  a  relationship  with  each
      other in the appellant's absence; the appellant's personal  background
      and the contribution made to his offending; the  steps  the  appellant
      has taken to address his offending and the fact that his circumstances
      have changed significantly since his  offending  meaning  any  further
      offences are in my view most unlikely."

49. Accordingly,  the  finding  that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  on  the
    claimant's partner and children for them to remain in  the  UK  on  his
    deportation was of critical importance.

50.  The  deportation  of  the  claimant  would  certainly  be   difficult,
    inconvenient, undesirable and perhaps harsh for  his  partner  and  his
    children and it would not be  in  the  children's  best  interests.  We
    recognise that to the extent that it was necessary to determine it, the
    judgement of whether the situation met the  standard  of  being  unduly
    harsh was primarily a matter for the FtTJ to determine, and she did  so
    before the correct approach to section 117C (5) was  clarified  by  the
    Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria). However, having considered  all  of  the
    circumstances considered by the FtTJ we are unable to identify a  basis
    on which it could  be  said  that  the  circumstances  which  the  FtTJ
    determined would pertain if the claimant is deported can be said to  be
    unduly harsh for the children or C.

51. For these reasons we find there to have been a material  error  of  law
    and allow the Secretary of State's appeal.

52. Parties were agreed that in the event that we allowed the Secretary  of
    State's appeal we should remake the decision in the Upper  Tribunal  on
    the basis of the facts found by the FtTJ.  We consider however that  it
    is appropriate to hear oral evidence from the claimant  and  any  other
    witnesses  he  wishes  to  tender  before  re-making   that   decision.
    Accordingly, we have given  directions  below  for  a  further  hearing
    before UTJ Smith in due course.

DECISION
We are satisfied that the Decision contains a material error of law. We  set
aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge J K  Swaney  promulgated  on
15 October 2018. We give the following directions for the re-making  of  the
decision:


DIRECTIONS
   53. Within 28 days from the date when this decision is promulgated,  the
       Appellant (AA) shall  file  with  the  Tribunal  and  serve  on  the
       Respondent any further evidence on which he relies.
   54. The appeal will be re-listed before UTJ Smith on the first available
