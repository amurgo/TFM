For the claimant: Mr S Umigwe, instructed by Harrison Morgan Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Afako promulgated 10.10.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  to
    curtail his leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The Judge heard the
    appeal on 17.9.14.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  White  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    11.12.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 3.2.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Afako should be set aside.

 5. The brief history is that the claimant arrived at Heathrow  on  17.5.13
    with a passport bearing leave to enter, issued on 22.8.11 (a  five-year
    multi-entry visit visa). However,  the  immigration  officer  concluded
    that false representations, or material facts had not  been  disclosed,
    for the purpose of obtaining that leave to  enter.  Enquiries  revealed
    that on his previous visit to the UK on  8.11.12  he  claimed  to  have
    stayed only 12 days, supported by  an  entry  stamp  showing  returning
    entry to Nigeria on 20.11.12. However,  he  actually  left  the  UK  on
    28.4.13. He had obtained a number of  false  Nigeria  entry  stamps  to
    falsely demonstrate that he had been in the UK a shorter period of time
    than he had. In fact, over the preceding 36 months he had been  in  the
    UK over 25 months. He stated that he had come to the UK for a period of
    two weeks, to visit his girlfriend Lisa Martin and his  baby  daughter,
    whilst staying with his cousin. In fact, he had a return flight  booked
    for 27.10.13.

 6. The immigration officer concluded that in the light of  the  claimant's
    attempts to conceal the true length of his previous stays  he  had  not
    come to the UK on this occasion for the purpose and period claimed, but
    rather to reside in the UK and that he had  used  deception.  Thus  his
    leave was cancelled.

 7. In summary, Judge Afako concluded that the cancellation of  leave  must
    have  been  pursuant  to  paragraph  321A(2)   and   thus   the   false
    representations or failure to disclose material facts  had  to  be  "in
    relation to the application for leave.." At  �8  the  judge  considered
    that the false representations, etc.,  relied  on  by  the  immigration
    officer only emerged after the decision to cancel leave and  were  thus
    irrelevant to the making of the decision and not within  the  terms  of
    paragraph 321A(2).

 8. The judge also considered, but discounted as not applicable,  paragraph
    321A(1), "such change in the circumstances of that person's case  since
    the leave was given, that it should be cancelled."

 9. Further, the judge regarded the cancellation of  leave  as  not  having
    been  sanctioned  by  a  Chief  Immigration  Officer   or   Immigration
    Inspector, as stated in paragraph 10 of the  Immigration  Rules,  which
    states that the power is not to be exercised by an Immigration  Officer
    acting alone. "The authority of a Chief Immigration Officer  or  of  an
    Immigration Inspector must always be obtained."

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge White found  it  arguable  that
    Judge Afako made an error of law in finding that the Secretary of State
    "had to prove more than that the stamps  were  falsified  in  order  to
    discharge the burden of  proof  (para  13),"  "...  given  that  it  is
    arguable that dishonesty may be inferred from the circumstances in  the
    absence of a plausible, innocent explanation from  the  appellant  (see
    the discussion in Shen (Paper appeals; proving dishonesty) [2014]  UKUT
    00236 (IAC)).

11.  For  the  Secretary  of  State,  Mr  Nath   relied   both   on   false
    representations or failure to disclose material facts,  and  change  of
    circumstances.

12. It emerged at the hearing before me that the claimant  still  does  not
    accept that he obtained false immigration stamps in  his  passport,  as
    stated in his witness statement of 2.9.14.  However, his  interview  on
    the day of arrival, the contemporaneous record of which was before  the
    Tribunal, amounts to clear admissions  of  everything  alleged  in  the
    Notice of Refusal of Leave to Enter. I note that the claimant  did  not
    give evidence at the First-tier Tribunal and  thus  the  only  relevant
    evidence before  the  Tribunal  fully  supported  the  claim  of  false
    representations or failure to  disclose  material  facts,  despite  the
    witness statement and grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

13. As the judge correctly observed at �8  and  the  wording  of  paragraph
    321A(2), the false representations  or  failure  to  disclose  material
    facts must relate to the application for leave, in other words the five-
    year multi-entry visit visa issued on 22.8.11. There was no evidence of
    false representations or failure to  disclose  material  facts  in  the
    application for that leave.

14. However, it is clear from the immigration history that the claimant had
    stayed longer than claimed in the UK  on  his  previous  visit,  having
    entered on 8.11.12 and left on 28.4.13, and sought,  by  the  dishonest
    use of false Nigerian entry stamps, to hide  the  true  length  of  his
    visit and the fact that over the preceding 36 months he had spent  over
    25 months in the UK. In the notice of refusal of leave  to  enter,  the
    immigration officer stated, "From the length of time you have spent  in
    the United Kingdom, I consider your true purpose is to reside  here,  a
    purpose other than that for which your visa  was  issued.  I  therefore
    cancel your continuing leave. If your leave was conferred by  an  entry
    clearance this will also have  the  effect  of  cancelling  your  entry
    clearance."

15. Paragraph 320(1) of the Immigration Rules provides as the first  ground
    on which entry clearance is to be refused,  a  mandatory  ground:  "The
    fact that entry clearance is being sought for a purpose not covered  by
    these Rules." It is clear on the evidence that the claimant was seeking
    leave to enter for a purpose not covered by the Rules. He was  in  fact
    seeking to reside in the UK for lengthy periods. Even  though  none  of
    those periods may have individually exceeded the 6  months  visit  visa
    limit, entry under paragraph 41 is for "a limited period as  stated  by
    him." The claimant falsely stated that  he  was  coming  for  only  two
    weeks, when he had a return flight booked for 27.10.13. In the light of
    the false representations or failure to disclose material facts, he was
    not believed. It  follows  that  the  refusal  of  leave  to  enter  is
    consistent with reliance on paragraph 320(1). Even though the  decision
    does not specifically refer to that  provision,  or  indeed  321A,  the
    wording is entirely consistent with 320(1).

16. From �7 of the First-tier Tribunal decision, Judge Afako  assumed  that
    the decision could only have been made under  paragraph  321A.  Perhaps
    this was because the judge considered that there had been a decision to
    cancel leave at port. However, the decision itself is headed 'Notice of
    Refusal of Leave to Enter.' Paragraph 320 sets out grounds for refusing
    either entry clearance or leave to enter.  However,  paragraph  320  is
    subject to 321, which  provides  for  refusal  of  leave  to  enter  in
    relation to a person in possession of an entry clearance  "duly  issued
    to him and is still current" only  where  the  Immigration  Officer  is
    satisfied that, either false representations were made in  relation  to
    the application for entry clearance, or that "a change of circumstances
    since it was issued has removed the basis  of  the  holder's  claim  to
    admission..."

17.  The  wording  of  the  refusal   decision   relies   on   both   false
    representations or failure to disclose material facts and  that  "there
    has been such a change of circumstances in your case  since  the  leave
    was granted that it should be cancelled," which suggests reliance  also
    on paragraph 321A.

18. Either under paragraph 321 or 321A, the Secretary of State was entitled
    to rely on change of circumstances since the leave was granted. At  �13
    Judge Afako considered this a "possible" argument but stated  that  the
    point needed to be explained in the decision and argued  on  appeal  by
    the Secretary of State who had the burden of proof. The judge concluded
    that this had not been done beyond the  bare  assertion.  That  is  not
    accurate. It is clear that the facts and immigration history as set out
    in the notice of decision  demonstrate  the  clear  use  of  deception,
    admitted by the claimant, to disguise the true length of his visits  to
    the UK. That is a  clear  and  obvious  change  of  circumstances.  The
    claimant was in fact seeking to reside in the UK, a purpose not covered
    by the grant of entry clearance as a family visit for  a  short  period
    "as stated by him" following which he intends to leave the UK.  In  the
    circumstances, the refusal to grant leave to enter and to cancel  leave
    was fully justified by the decision of the Secretary of State.

19. An issue relied on by the judge at �14 of the decision, relates to  the
    exercise of the  power  to  refuse  leave  to  enter  or  cancel  entry
    clearance, which requires the authority of a Chief Immigration  Officer
    or an Immigration Inspector. This issue appears to have been raised  by
    the judge alone; it was not  raised  as  a  ground  of  appeal  by  the
    claimant. Neither was the Secretary of State put on  notice  that  this
    issue was to be raised. The grounds of appeal assert that  this  is  an
    internal procedure and that the decision was countersigned by the Chief
    Immigration Officer. Mr Unigwe sought  to  persuade  me  that  I  could
    compare the signature on the interview record with that on the  refusal
    notice and see that the same person had signed both. However, I am  not
    an expert in handwriting and cannot make such a comparison. It  is  the
    assertion of the Secretary of State that it was  duly  authorised.  How
    that is done in practice is very likely  to  be  an  internal  process.
    There is nothing in the Rules to  require  the  signature  of  a  Chief
    Immigration  Officer  or  an  Immigration  Inspector  to  the   refusal
    decision. In the circumstances, I find that the Secretary of State  was
    not required  to  demonstrate  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    decision had been authorised by  a  Chief  Immigration  Officer  or  an
    Immigration Inspector and that this was  not  a  matter  fatal  to  the
    decision, as claimed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

20. In the circumstances, there were material errors of law in  the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  it  cannot  stand
    and must be set aside and remade, which I do by dismissing  the  appeal
    on immigration grounds, for the reasons set out above.

21. I do not deal with human rights and article 8 ECHR. Although  addressed
    in the most vague and general terms in the written submissions  of  the
    claimant's representative to the Upper Tribunal, it was not  raised  in
    the grounds of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal,  or  in  submissions
    before the First-tier Tribunal, and  did  not  form  any  part  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. In Sarkar [2014] EWCA Civ 195, the
    Court of Appeal held that even when Article 8  is  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal, if no evidence is adduced and no submissions made the appellant
    can be taken to have abandoned it as a ground of appeal and  the  Judge
    does not err in failing to deal with it. In the circumstances,  I  need
    not address article 8 at all. Furthermore, it is open to  the  claimant
    to make application for further entry clearance as a visitor, or indeed
    for the purpose of settling in the UK as a spouse. What  he  was  doing
    was to subvert immigration controls by misusing the visit visa  process
    for effective residence in  the  UK,  without  making  the  appropriate
    immigration application. In the circumstances, even  if  article  8  is
    engaged in this case, in any Razgar balancing exercise between  on  the
    one hand the rights of the claimant and his now wife and child  and  on
    the other the legitimate and necessary public  interest  in  protecting
    the economic well-being of the UK through immigration control,  bearing
    in mind section 117B of the 2002 Act,  I  would  have  found  that  the
    decision was entirely proportionate and not unduly harsh (Nagre).

Conclusion & Decision:

22. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of the claimant has been dismissed and  thus  there  can
be no fee award.
