 1. In considering exclusion under Article 1F(b), the test is whether there
    are 'serious reasons to  consider  that  the  appellant  is  guilty  of
    conduct that amounts to a serious non-political offence'.  'Serious' in
    this context has an autonomous international meaning and is not  to  be
    defined purely by national law or the length of the sentence.  Guidance
    on the meaning of 'serious' in relation to Article 1F(c) may  be  found
    in the decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  Al-Sirri  and  another  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] UKSC 54 at  paragraph
    [75].  Arts 1F(a) and (c) serve to illustrate the level of  seriousness
    required to engage Article 1F(b); the genus  of  seriousness  is  at  a
    common level throughout.

 2. A claimant's personal participation in acts leading to exclusion  under
    Article 1F(b) must be established to the  ordinary  civil  standard  of
    proof, that the  material  facts  are  more  probable  than  not.   The
    appellant's  guilt  need  not  be  proved  to  the  criminal  standard.
    Personal participation in a conspiracy to  promote  terrorist  violence
    can be a 'serious crime' for the purpose of Article  1F(b).  Where  the
    personal  acts  of  participation  by  a  claimant  take  the  form  of
    assistance to others who are planning violent crimes, the nature of the
    acts thereby supported can be taken into account.  The  relevant  crime
    may be an agreement to commit the  criminal  acts  (in  English  law  a
    conspiracy), rather than a choate crime.

 3. In the absence of some  strikingly  unfair  procedural  defect,  United
    Kingdom courts and tribunals should  accord  a  significant  degree  of
    respect to the decision of senior sister Courts in European Union legal
    systems; there is a particular degree of mutual  confidence  and  trust
    between legal systems that form part of the same legal order within the
    European Union.  However, the ultimate question of whether the  conduct
    of  which  the  United  Kingdom  court  or  Tribunal  is  satisfied  is
    sufficiently serious to justify exclusion is a matter for the  national
    court or tribunal.

 4. The examination of seriousness should be directed at the criminal  acts
    when they were committed, although events in the supervening passage of
    time may be relevant  to  whether  exclusion  is  justified:  a  formal
    pardon, or subsequent acquittal, or other event illuminating the nature
    of the activity may be relevant to this assessment. Despite suggestions
    to the contrary by respected commentators, it does not appear to be the
    case that service of the sentence, or indeed a final acquittal,  brings
    the application of the exclusion clause to an end.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant is an Algerian citizen who cannot return  to  Algeria  as
    his life and liberty are in jeopardy and it is recognised that he has a
    well founded fear of persecution  there.   He  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom in 2001 and  claimed  asylum  and  humanitarian  status.  Those
    claims were refused because the Secretary of State concluded  that  the
    exclusion clauses applied in both cases.

 2. The appellant has been granted periods of discretionary leave  for  six
    months at a time and there are  no  removal  directions.   He  appealed
    against the refusal of status in 2006  and  his  appeal  has  not  been
    finally resolved since. In the appeal he seeks to  upgrade  his  status
    from discretionary leave to remain to that of refugee  or  humanitarian
    status  under   Council   Directive   2004/83/EC   (the   Qualification
    Directive).

 3. The basis for his exclusion was his conviction in France in 1999 of the
    offence of 'participation � une association de malfaiteurs en  relation
    avec  une  entreprise  terroriste'  ('participation   in   a   criminal
    association with a terrorist enterprise').

 4. He had been acquitted of this offence by the Tribunal de Grand Instance
    on 30 June 1998 but given a six month sentence for a lesser offence  of
    possession and use of false documents.   The  prosecutor  appealed  the
    acquittal and,  on  a  re-hearing  before  the  Cour  d'Appel,  he  was
    convicted of the above offence and sentenced to two years' imprisonment
    that had already been served on remand.

 5. The particulars of charge, translated from the French, were :
        'In Paris, Nanterre, and the Lyon region,  during  1994,  1995  and
        1996, more precisely, until October 1995  at  any  rate  on  French
        territory for an unspecified length of time, having  been  involved
        in a gang formed or arrangement set up in view of the  preparation-
        demonstrated by one or more material facts - of acts  of  terrorism
        in connection with an individual or  collective  undertaking  which
        aimed to seriously disturb public  order  through  intimidation  or
        terror. In Paris, during 1995, at any rate on French territory  for
        an unspecified length of time, committed a fraudulent  manipulation
        of the truth likely to cause damage to documents issued by a public
        authority in view  of  granting  a  right,  identity  or  capacity,
        granting a permission; in the case in point, a passport in the name
        of Gutierrez and an identity card in the name of  Wane  and  having
        made use of those documents. With the additional circumstance  that
        all of the above-mentioned  offences  were  committed  directly  or
        indirectly  in  connection  with  an   individual   or   collective
        undertaking which aimed to seriously  disturb public order  through
        intimidation or terror.'
 6.   Article 1F of the Refugee Convention[1] is in the following terms:
         "The provisions of this Convention shall not apply  to  any  person
         with respect to whom there  are  serious  reasons  for  considering
         that:
             (a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or  a
             crime  against  humanity,  as  defined  in  the  international
             instruments drawn up to make  provision  in  respect  of  such
             crimes;
             (b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the
             country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as  a
             refugee;
             (c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to  the  purposes  and
             principles of the United Nations."
 7. The Secretary of State relies principally on Article 1F(b) although she
    also prays in aid Article 1F(c).

 8.    Here, there are clearly serious reasons  for  considering  that  the
    appellant has committed a crime outside the country of his refuge prior
    to his admission to the United Kingdom; the  French  Cour  d'Appel  has
    convicted him of such a crime and its judgment is before us. It is  not
    contended that this conviction was for a political crime as  it  was  a
    crime committed against the law of a host state to which the  appellant
    had fled in 1992 from Algeria. France is,  of  course,  both  a  Member
    state of the European Union and a party to the European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.

 9.      The sole issue under Article 1F(b) is whether the crime  of  which
    he is convicted is a serious one.  This  apparently  simple  issue  has
    proved difficult to resolve.  It is common ground that the  offence  of
    possession/use of false identity documents alone  is  not  sufficiently
    serious to lead  to  exclusion  from  the  Refugee  Convention,  whilst
    personal participation in a terrorist  conspiracy  against  the  French
    state probably would be.

10.  In 2006 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal dismissed his  appeal  but
    reconsideration  was  ordered.  On  19  January  2010,  the  AIT  again
    dismissed the appeal, but in doing so used the concept  of  "membership
    of a group", following  Gurung  (Exclusion-Risk-Maoists)  Nepal  [2002]
    UKIAT 04870 (starred) [2003] Imm AR 115, to attribute to the  appellant
    the terrorist activities of others and found him to be  excluded  under
    both Articles 1F(c) and 1F(b).

11. The decision of the  Supreme Court in R (JS (Sri Lanka)) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2011] 1 AC 184 disapproved this approach
    to the application of the exclusion clause and the authority of Gurung,
    on which it had been based. The Court of Justice of the European  Union
    had similarly concluded that  individual  participation  in  crime  was
    needed in Bundesrepublik Deutschland v B and D (Cases  C-57/09  and  C-
    101/09) [2011] Imm AR  190,  when  it  considered  Article  12  of  the
    Qualification Directive, where the same words are used  as  in  Article
    1F.

The decision of the Court of Appeal:

12. The AIT's second decision in the present case  was  set  aside  by  the
    Court of Appeal on 3 April 2012 (AH  (Algeria)  v  Secretary  of  State
    [2012] EWCA Civ 395) and the appeal remitted to the Upper Tribunal  for
    remaking for a third time.

13.  Sullivan LJ gave the leading judgment. He observed:
         "18.     If the underlying objective for the purpose of Article  1F
             is  to  establish   the   individual's   personal   role   and
             responsibility, the nature  of  the  particular  offence  with
             which this Appellant was charged presents a problem.  In  "The
             Investigation  and  Prosecution  of  Terrorists  Suspects   in
             France",  an  independent  report  commissioned  by  the  Home
             Office, dated November 2006, Professor Jacqueline Hodgson says
             that the expanded definition of terrorism in 1996:
                       "...widened the  scope  of  the  magistrates'  powers
                  significantly, allowing them to open  investigations  into
                  those involved with terrorist  organisations  (within  and
                  outside France) before any terrorist act had taken  place.
                  ...This offence pushes back the boundary  of  criminality,
                  enabling the judge to act very much earlier  when  no  act
                  has been committed, but  when  the  'suspect'  is  perhaps
                  buying  materials,  is  in  the  very  early   stages   of
                  preparation  towards  a  terrorist  act,  or   is   simply
                  associating with a group established to  prepare  acts  of
                  terrorism - even when the judge is unable  to  identify  a
                  specific  date  or  terrorist  target   to   which   these
                  activities are linked."    (emphasis added)
         19.  While it is true that the French Appeal Court did  not  simply
             find that the Appellant was in close contact with men involved
             in terrorist acts, it  went  further  and  concluded  that  he
             belonged to a "common organisation", it was not necessary  for
             the French Appeal Court to form any view as to the Appellant's
             role in the "conspiracy or grouping  formed  with  a  view  to
             committing terrorist acts", nor was it necessary to  establish
             that the group had carried out any particular preparatory act:
             it was sufficient that the conspiracy  or  grouping  had  been
             "formed with a view to the preparation, taking the form of one
             or more material acts, of acts of  terrorism  ...."  (emphasis
             added).
         20.  It is not clear what "material acts" were relied upon  by  the
             Appeal Court in allowing the  prosecutor's  appeal.  The  only
             specific conduct attributed  to  the  Appellant  was  that  he
             falsified a French passport by affixing his own photograph  in
             place of the genuine holder
                  "...so that he could travel in  connection  with  unlawful
                  activities of that organisation  or  grouping,  and  where
                  necessary to escape  any  investigations  which  might  be
                  carried out by the French  police  as  a  result  of  that
                  organisation or grouping in France."
             The conviction relates to the falsification of  administrative
             documents. The Appellant had also falsified a French  national
             identity card by affixing a photograph of his  brother.  While
             the Appeal Court found his explanation for this  unconvincing,
             it said that "the actual circumstances in which his brother in
             Algeria was to use this falsified document are unknown."
         21.  There can be no  dispute  that,  as  an  instrument  of  state
             policy, "nipping terrorism in the bud" is eminently  sensible.
             However, if the criminal law framed in aid of the policy foils
             the  aspiring  terrorist's  intentions  well  before  he   has
             undertaken any, or any significant, preparatory acts, then the
             consequence for the purpose of Article 1F may well be that the
             offence of which he is convicted, at  the  outer  boundary  of
             criminality, will not be an offence which is so serious as  to
             exclude him from protection under the Convention."
14.  He then concluded:
         "30. I do not accept the submission that each  signatory  state  is
             free to adopt its own definition of what constitutes a serious
             crime for the purpose of  Article  1F(b).  In  JS  Lord  Brown
             recorded in paragraph 18 of his judgment that  it  was  common
             ground between the parties "that there can be  only  one  true
             interpretation of Article 1F(a), an autonomous meaning  to  be
             found  in  international  rather  than  domestic  law".   This
             approach was endorsed by Pill LJ  in  DD  in  the  context  of
             Article 1F(c): see paragraph 47 of his judgment.
          1. It seems to me that the same approach must apply to  paragraph
             (b) in Article 1F. While  the  Convention  leaves  it  to  the
             domestic courts of the signatory states to decide whether,  in
             any particular case, a non-political crime is "serious",  that
             determination must be founded upon a common starting point  as
             to the level of seriousness that must  be  demonstrated  if  a
             person is to be excluded from the protection of the Convention
             by reason of his past criminal conduct.
          1. Although the parties' researches did not identify any  binding
             domestic  authority  on  the  point,  the   proposition   that
             signatory states do not have  an  unfettered  discretion  when
             deciding whether an offence is "serious" for  the  purpose  of
             Article 1F(b) is  supported  by  academic  authority.  In  The
             Refugee in International Law 3rd Edn.  Professor  Goodwin-Gill
             says:
                  "Each State must  determine  what  constitutes  a  serious
                  crime, according to its own standards up to a  point,  but
                  on  the  basis  of  the  ordinary  meaning  of  the  words
                  considered in context and with the objectives of the  1951
                  Convention. Given that the words  are  not  self-applying,
                  each party has some discretion in determining whether  the
                  criminal character of the applicant for refugee status  in
                  fact outweighs his or her character as bona fide  refugee,
                  and so constitutes a threat to its internal order. Just as
                  the 1951 Conference rejected 'extradition crimes' as an  a
                  priori excludable category, so ad hoc  approaches  founded
                  on length of sentence are of little help,  unless  related
                  to  the  nature  and   circumstances   of   the   offence.
                  Commentators and jurisprudence  seem  to  agree,  however,
                  that serious crimes, above all, are those against physical
                  integrity, life and liberty." (page 176)
          1. There would appear to be a  degree  of  uniformity  among  the
             commentators that the Handbook sets the threshold at or  about
             the correct degree  of  seriousness.  Thus,  Professor  Grahl-
             Madsen concluded in "The Status of Refugees  in  International
             Law" that:
                  "As we see it, Article 1F(b) should  only  be  applied  in
                  cases where the person in question is considered guilty of
                  a major offence (a 'crime' in  the  French  sense  of  the
                  word), and only if the crime is such that it may warrant a
                  really substantial punishment, that is to say:  the  death
                  penalty or deprivation of liberty for several  years,  and
                  this not only according to the  laws  of  the  country  of
                  origin, but also according to the laws of the  country  of
                  refuge." (page 297)
          1. In "The Law of Refugee Status" Professor Hathaway agrees with
             Grahl-Madsen:
                  "Atle Grahl-Madsen interprets this  clause  to  mean  that
                  only crimes punishable by several years' imprisonment  are
                  of sufficient gravity to offset  a  fear  of  persecution.
                  UNHCR defines seriousness by  reference  to  crimes  which
                  involve significant  violence  against  persons,  such  as
                  homicide, rape, child molesting,  wounding,  arson,  drugs
                  traffic,  and  armed  robbery.  These  are  crimes   which
                  ordinarily warrant severe punishment,  thus  making  clear
                  the  Convention's  commitment  to   the   withholding   of
                  protection  only  from  those  who  have  committed  truly
                  abhorrent wrongs." (page 224)
          1. Professor Gilbert in "Current issues  in  the  application  of
             exclusion clauses", a background  paper  commissioned  by  the
             UNHCR, points out that the statement in the  Handbook  is  not
             supported by authority in international or domestic  law,  but
             suggests  that  while  capital  crimes  may  not  in  and   of
             themselves be  a  sufficient  test,  "offences  of  sufficient
             seriousness  to  attract  very  long  periods   of   custodial
             punishment might suffice to guide  states  as  to  what  might
             fulfil Article 1F(b)". (page 449)
          1. In a statement provided to the Grand Chamber in the  B  and  D
             case, the UNHCR set out its view as to the seriousness of  the
             acts covered by Article 1F, as follows:
                  "All the types of criminal acts leading to exclusion under
                  Article 1F of the 1951 Convention involve a high degree of
                  seriousness. This is obvious regarding Article  1F(a)  and
                  (c), which address acts of the most egregious nature  such
                  as "war crimes" or  "crimes  against  humanity"  or  "acts
                  contrary to the purposes  and  principles  of  the  United
                  Nations". In light of  its  context  and  the  object  and
                  purpose of the  exclusion  grounds  highlighted  above,  a
                  "serious non political crime"  covered  by  Article  1F(b)
                  must  also  involve   a   high   threshold   of   gravity.
                  Consequently, the nature of an allegedly  excludable  act,
                  the  context  in  which  it  occurred  and  all   relevant
                  circumstances of the case should be taken into account  to
                  assess whether  the  act  is  serious  enough  to  warrant
                  exclusion within the meaning of Article 1F(b) and  1F(c)."
                  (paragraph 2.2.1)
          1. The four questions answered by the Grand Chamber in B and D
             did not directly address this issue, but the Grand Chamber did
             say in paragraph 108 of its judgment:
                  "[108] Exclusion from refugee status on one of the grounds
                  laid down in Article 12(2)(b) or (c) of Directive 2004/83,
                  as stated in respect of the answer to the first  question,
                  is linked to the seriousness of the acts committed,  which
                  must be of such a degree that the person concerned  cannot
                  legitimately claim the  protection  attaching  to  refugee
                  status under Article 2(d) of that directive."
          1. In paragraph [109] of its judgment the Grand Chamber  accepted
             the submission of, inter alia, the UK Government, that Article
             12(2) did not require a proportionality assessment, but it did
             so upon the basis that the competent authority  would  already
             have undertaken an assessment of the seriousness of  the  acts
             committed  by  the  person  concerned  and  of  that  person's
             individual responsibility, so that "a fresh assessment of  the
             level of seriousness of the acts committed was not  required."
             It is clear,  therefore,  that  for  the  purpose  of  Article
             12(2)(b) or (c) there must be an assessment of  the  level  of
             seriousness of the acts committed, and the seriousness must be
             of such a degree that the offender cannot  legitimately  claim
             refugee status.
          1. The Tribunal did not give separate consideration to paragraphs
             (b) and  (c)  in  Article  1F.  While  terrorism  is  a  grave
             international threat, merely labelling an offences a terrorist
             offence is not sufficient, of itself, to  establish  that  the
             offence is a serious offence for the purpose of Article 1F(b).
             There is no discussion  in  the  Tribunal's  determination  of
             either the seriousness of this particular  terrorist  offence,
             or the appropriate threshold of seriousness for the purpose of
             Article 1F.
          1. While I would accept that an offence which carries  a  maximum
             sentence of 10 years imprisonment is capable of being the kind
             of offence which warrants  "severe"  or  "really  substantial"
             punishment,  or  which  attracts  a  "very  long  period"   of
             custodial  punishment,  the  fact  that  this  Appellant   was
             sentenced to 2 years imprisonment suggests that such facts  as
             were found in respect of his particular offence placed  it  at
             the lower end of seriousness of this kind of offence.
          1. I do not overlook the fact that the [French] Appeal Court said
             that the original sentence of six months imprisonment was "not
             proportionate to the  serious  nature  of  the  acts  and  the
             disruption to public order", and was of the opinion  that  "by
             reason of the seriousness of the acts"  only  a  non-suspended
             sentence was appropriate, but these observations are simply  a
             reflection of the fact that "seriousness" is  bound  to  be  a
             relative concept when a  domestic  court  is  considering  the
             appropriate sentence  for  a  particular  offence.  Nor  do  I
             overlook the fact that "definitive deportation" was ordered as
             an additional penalty.
          1. Taking all of these factors into account, I do not see how  it
             could have been concluded on the basis  of  the  very  limited
             findings of  the  French  Appeal  Court  that  the  particular
             offence of which this  Appellant  was  convicted  crossed  the
             threshold of seriousness for the purpose of Article 1F(b),  as
             that threshold has been variously described  by  the  academic
             commentators referred to in paragraphs 32-36 (above).  Further
             discussion of the threshold is unnecessary  because  there  is
             another, fatal, flaw in the Tribunal's reasoning."
15.  Lord Justices Rix and Ward concurred in the  result  but  for  briefer
    reasons: the Tribunal had erred in its approach  and  it  was  unclear,
    from the extracts from the judgment of the French Cour d'Appel cited by
    the Tribunal, precisely what overt acts the appellant had committed.

16. The appeal was heard in the Upper Tribunal on 30 October 2012, and  the
    decision reserved, with leave to the parties to provide written closing
    submissions within 21 days. The appellant did  not  give  further  oral
    evidence.  The appeal proceeded on the basis of the facts already found
    and the documentary material before the Upper Tribunal.

The decision of the Supreme Court in Al-Sirri

17. On 21 November 2012, the United Kingdom  Supreme  Court  published  its
    decision in Al-Sirri and another v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2012]  UKSC  54  and  the  parties  were  also  given   an
    opportunity to make submissions on that judgment.  The  case  concerned
    whether participation in armed uprisings could amount to acts  contrary
    to United Nations for the purposes of Article 1F(c).

18. The Supreme Court identified three issues  for  consideration  in  that
    decision:

        i. whether all activities defined as terrorism by our domestic  law
           are for that reason alone acts  contrary  to  the  purposes  and
           principles of the United Nations,  or  whether  such  activities
           must constitute a threat to international peace and security  or
           to the peaceful relations between nations;

       ii. whether armed insurrection  is  contrary  to  the  purposes  and
           principles of the United Nations if directed, not  only  against
           the incumbent government, but also  against  a  United  Nations-
           mandated force  supporting  that  government,  specifically  the
           International Security Assistance Force ("ISAF") in Afghanistan;
            and

      iii. what is meant by "serious reasons for considering" a  person  to
           be guilty of the acts in question?

19. The principles and purposes of  the  United  Nations  are  set  out  in
    Article 1 of  its  Charter  and  summarised  at  paragraph  10  of  the
    judgment:

         "10. The purposes of the United Nations are set out in article 1 of
         the Charter. The first purpose is

             "1.  To maintain international peace and security, and to that
                  end:  to  take  effective  collective  measures  for   the
                  prevention and removal of threats to the  peace,  and  for
                  the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of
                  the peace, and to bring about by peaceful  means,  and  in
                  conformity   with   the   principles   of   justice    and
                  international   law,   adjustment   or    settlement    of
                  international disputes or situations which might lead to a
                  breach of the peace."

         "The second is "to develop friendly relations among  nations  based
         on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination
         of peoples, and to take other appropriate  measures  to  strengthen
         universal  peace";  the  third   is   "to   achieve   international
         cooperation in  solving  international  problems  of  an  economic,
         social, cultural, or humanitarian nature", and  in  "promoting  and
         encouraging respect for human rights and for  fundamental  freedoms
         for all"; and the fourth is to be  a  centre  for  harmonising  the
         actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends."

20. The Court held that:

         (i)   Article  1F(c)  must  be  interpreted  narrowly  and  applied
             restrictively, following in particular the commentary of Grahl-
             Madsen in The Status of Refugees in International Law, 1966, p
             283 that such was the basis on which agreement was reached  to
             insert the provision into Article 1F;

         (ii)     The Article 1F(c) exclusion applies to acts  which,  "even
             if they are not covered by the definitions of  crimes  against
             peace, war crimes or crimes against  humanity  as  defined  in
             international instruments within the meaning of Article 1F(a),
             are nevertheless of a comparable egregiousness and  character,
             such as sustained human rights violations and acts which  have
             been clearly identified  and  accepted  by  the  international
             community as being contrary to the purposes and principles  of
             the United Nations";

         (iii)    Not every act condemned by the United  Nations  is  to  be
             deemed contrary to its principles  and  purposes.   The  Court
             looked for guidance  to  the  UNHCR  Background  Note  on  the
             application of  the  Exclusion  Clauses  (September  2003)  at
             paragraph 47:

                  "... [Article] 1F(c) only applies to acts that offend  the
                  principles  and  purposes  of  the  United  Nations  in  a
                  fundamental manner. Article 1F(c) is thus  triggered  only
                  in extreme circumstances by  activity  which  attacks  the
                  very basis of the international  community's  co-existence
                  under the auspices of the United Nations. The key words in
                  article  1F(c)  'acts  contrary  to   the   purposes   and
                  principles of the  United  Nations'  should  therefore  be
                  construed restrictively and its application  reserved  for
                  situations where an act and the consequences thereof  meet
                  a high threshold. This  threshold  should  be  defined  in
                  terms of the gravity of the act in question, the manner in
                  which the act is organised, its international  impact  and
                  long-term   objectives,   and   the    implications    for
                  international peace and security. Thus, crimes capable  of
                  affecting  international  peace,  security  and   peaceful
                  relations between states would fall within this clause, as
                  would serious and sustained violations of human rights."

         (iv)      Mere  membership   of   a   terrorist   organisation   is
             insufficient to engage the  exclusion  provisions  of  Article
             1F(c).  At paragraph 15 of the judgment, their Lordships  held
             that:

                  "Thirdly,  for  exclusion   from   international   refugee
                  protection to be justified, it must be  established  that
                  there are serious reasons for considering that the person
                  concerned had individual responsibility for  acts  within
                  the scope of article 1F(c): see the  detailed  discussion
                  at paras 50 to 75 of the UNHCR  "Background  Note".  This
                  requires an individualised consideration of the facts  of
                  the  case,  which  will  include  an  assessment  of  the
                  person's involvement in the  act  concerned,  his  mental
                  state  and  possible  grounds  for  rejecting  individual
                  responsibility.  As  a  general  proposition,  individual
                  responsibility arises where the individual  committed  an
                  act within the scope of article 1F(c), or participated in
                  its commission in a manner that gives rise to  individual
                  responsibility, for example through planning, instigating
                  or  ordering  the  act  in  question,  or  by  making   a
                  significant  contribution  to  the  commission   of   the
                  relevant act, in the knowledge that his act  or  omission
                  would facilitate the act. ..."

         (v)  It was not appropriate to apply the criminal standard of proof
             of guilt although 'considering' was stronger than 'believing',
             which was the word Lord Brown in JS  (Sri  Lanka)  thought  at
             [39] it was more approximate to than 'suspecting'.  The  Court
             concluded at [75]:

                  "We are, it is clear, attempting to discern the autonomous
                  meaning of the words "serious reasons for considering". We
                  do so in the light of the UNHCR view, with which we agree,
                  that the exclusion clauses in the Refugee Convention  must
                  be restrictively interpreted and cautiously applied.  This
                  leads us to draw the following conclusions:

                  (1)   "Serious  reasons"  is  stronger  than   "reasonable
                      grounds".

                  (2)  The evidence from which  those  reasons  are  derived
                      must be "clear and credible" or "strong".

                  (3)  "Considering" is stronger than "suspecting".  In  our
                      view  it  is  also  stronger  than  "believing".   It
                      requires the considered  judgment  of  the  decision-
                      maker.

                  (4)  The  decision-maker  need  not  be  satisfied  beyond
                      reasonable doubt  or  to  the  standard  required  in
                      criminal law.

                  (5)  It is unnecessary to import our domestic standards of
                      proof into the question. The circumstances of refugee
                      claims, and the nature of the evidence available, are
                      so  variable.  However,  if  the  decision-maker   is
                      satisfied that it is more likely than  not  that  the
                      applicant has not committed the crimes in question or
                      has not been guilty of acts contrary to the  purposes
                      and principles of the United Nations, it is difficult
                      to  see  how  there  could  be  serious  reasons  for
                      considering that he had done so. The reality is  that
                      there are unlikely to be sufficiently serious reasons
                      for considering the applicant to be guilty unless the
                      decision-maker can be satisfied  on  the  balance  of
                      probabilities  that  he  is.  But  the  task  of  the
                      decision-maker  is  to  apply  the   words   of   the
                      Convention (and  the  Directive)  in  the  particular
                      case."

The fuller translations

21. In the course of our deliberations we discovered that there were  parts
    of the French judgments that had not been translated into English.   In
    the case of the Paris Cour d'Appel proceedings, the translation omitted
    all parts of those proceedings not  directly  related  to  the  present
    appellant. We considered, particularly in the light of the history  and
    issues in this case, that we should have the fullest  understanding  of
    what the French courts had decided and why, and we  directed  that  the
    remaining passages be translated.  The principal charges  laid  against
    the appellant and his sixteen co-defendants  were  conspiracy  charges:
    many of the other defendants were found by the  Cour  d'Appel  to  have
    been  involved,  with  various  degrees  of  responsibility,   in   the
    conspiracy.

22. At our request, a full professional translation of the  first  instance
    and Cour d'Appel proceedings was provided to us in January 2013 and  it
    is on the basis of that translation that we consider the  decisions  of
    the French courts.





The background to the appellant's arrest in France

Events in Algeria

23. The appellant's arrest and conviction occurred at a time of  heightened
    terrorist activity in France by Algerian nationals in the 1990s,  which
    for the purpose of this appeal began with the banning of the  political
    party FIS (Front Islamique du Salut) in Algeria in 1992, after it won a
    resounding victory in the Algerian elections.  The sequence  of  events
    in Algeria and France in the early 1990s is well  known  to  judges  of
    this Chamber and the following background is taken from information  in
    the public domain. There was an army-led coup, a state of emergency was
    declared, and on March 4 1992, the  FIS  was  dissolved  by  government
    decree.  Prominent FIS leaders were  arrested:  those  who  could  move
    abroad to continue political opposition from there or  seek  safety  in
    exile.

24. The Groupe Islamique Arm�  (GIA)  was  opposed  both  to  the  Algerian
    government and the FIS, formed in July 1992 as a breakaway from the FIS
    and the Mouvement Islamique Armee (MIA).  On  26  August  1992  Algiers
    airport was bombed, killing 9 and injuring 128. Hossein  Abderrahim,  a
    member of the FIS, was arrested, tortured, and executed for his part in
    the bombing.  Algeria descended into civil war.   Government  reprisals
    were swift and many of those convicted in relation to the bombing  were
    executed.

25. After the Algiers airport bombing and the  executions  which  followed,
    many of those connected with the FIS and GIA  travelled  abroad,  where
    they continued their activities of fund  raising  for  the  cause,  and
    planned, and carried out, acts of terrorism.  The leader  of  the  FIS,
    Mourad Dhina, travelled to Switzerland where  he  successfully  claimed
    political asylum and continued to engage with those working in  France.



26. The appellant himself on his own admission was connected with  the  FIS
    in Algeria and left Algeria in 1992.   In  1993  he  was  convicted  in
    absentia for participation in the  airport  bombing  and  sentenced  to
    death. Neither the Secretary of State,  nor  the  French  Cour  d'Appel
    relied on the fact of his Algerian convictions, but his connection with
    Algerian militants in France needs to be seen against the background of
    these events.

27. The appellant was lawfully in France, first as a businessman and  later
    on various temporary residence permits, until  mid-1995.   He  did  not
    have leave to remain thereafter.  The criminal proceedings  began  with
    his arrest in October 1995 in  connection  with  a  wave  of  terrorist
    incidents across France that summer.   The overt acts in this  campaign
    are a matter of public record and the background at  [28]  to  [34]  is
    derived from publicly available sources to set  the  context  from  the
    arrest of the appellant and his immediate associates.

Algerian terrorism in France
28. In 1994, Yassin Boubekeur arranged transport of arms  for  the  GIA  to
    Sweden.

29. On 11 July 1995, Imam Sahraoui was  assassinated  in  Paris  by  Khaled
    Kelkal and a national manhunt for Kelkal  commenced.   It  was  thought
    that the assassination was ordered by the GIA or persons close to  that
    organisation, because the Imam's position was too moderate,  and  there
    were suspicions that he had embezzled GIA funds.

30. Meanwhile, on 25 July 1995, a three-man cell comprising  Rachid  Ramda,
    Boualem Bensa�d and Smain Belkacem organised a bomb attack on the Paris
    Metro.  Ramda was the financier and organiser of the attack.   A  glass
    bottle full of nails exploded in the St Michel RER station,  killing  8
    and seriously injuring another 87  civilians.   Ramda  escaped  to  the
    United Kingdom in November  1995,  but  was  extradited  to  France  in
    December 2005.

31. On 26 August  1995,  the  third  anniversary  of  the  Algiers  airport
    bombing, Kelkal placed a gas bottle bomb on the  Paris-Lyon  TGV  line,
    near Cailloux-sur-Fontaines in the Rh�ne area.  It was very similar  in
    manufacture to the St Michel bomb. The TGV bomb was discovered and made
    safe before it exploded.

32. On 7 September 1995,  Bensa�d,  described  as  Kelkal's  superior,  was
    responsible for the planting of a car bomb  which  exploded  outside  a
    Jewish school in Villeurbanne, a suburb of Lyon, timed to coincide with
    the end of the school day. Fortunately, the children came out of school
    late on that day, and no one was hurt, but the potential  for  harm  to
    the  schoolchildren  and  those  collecting  them   from   school   was
    significant.

33. On 29 September 1995, Kelkal was shot  and  killed  in  the  Forest  of
    Malval, near Lyon, while resisting arrest. His address book  was  found
    and used to locate and arrest other members of the  terrorist  network.
    On the same day, Bensa�d was arrested in Paris.  He was found  to  have
    been planning a further bombing in Lille. He was later convicted of the
    abortive bombing of the Paris-Lyon TGV train and sentenced to 30 years'
    imprisonment.

The arrests in 1995 and 1996

34. The information derived from the  French  criminal  proceedings  is  as
    follows.

35. In March 1995, Djamel Tehari was arrested.  He was found to have on him
    a list of weapons to be purchased, and an  electronic  diary  in  which
    many of the  telephone  numbers  were  encoded  which  provided  useful
    information on the rest of the network with which he was  involved.  He
    was in due course prosecuted along with the appellant.

36. On 22 September 1995, three scientists were arrested in the Lyon  area.
    Ali Drif was working as a research  assistant  at  INSA  (the  National
    Institute of Applied Science) in Lyons.  The two others,  Kamel  Eddine
    Ouadou  and  Sebti  Bouabdallah  were  lecturers  in  mathematics   and
    information technology at the Ecole Centrale in Lyons.

37. On 6 October 1995, the appellant was arrested, along  with  a  relative
    described variously as his brother-in-law or cousin whom we will  refer
    to as his cousin KS, who  was  looking  after  two  falsified  identity
    documents, namely a passport and an identity  card,  for  him,  in  the
    names of Guterriez and Wane.

38. On 13 May 1996, the authorities arrested ten men  who  ran  a  document
    forgery ring from an Algerian workers' hostel, the Foyer Sonacotra,  in
    Nanterre:  their leader, Salem Nassah, allowed Algerians to stay in the
    hostel without papers and kept a telephone line which  was  manned  and
    messages taken by the other members of the  team.   The  full  list  of
    those arrested was: Salem  Nassah,  Khaled  Abaidia,  Nacer  Bouhemila,
    Yousr Dahdouh, Mohamed  Hanachi,  Abdelfateh  Khankar,  Mohamed  Toufik
    Kridech, Youssef Layachi and three men whose real  names  were  unknown
    but who gave their names as  Hamralaf  Meddah,  Mohamed  Mehaibia,  and
    Fouad Touhami.  As well as trading in personal identity documents, they
    admitted buying used cars in France which they shipped back and sold in
    Algeria, altering or forging the logbooks to  make  them  appear  newer
    than they were.

39.  There were further arrests at Brian�on in the High Alps,  Rive-de-Gier
    in Loire, and in the Rhone Alps region, in  particular  at  Chasse-sur-
    Rh�ne.


The Tribunal de Grand Instance


40. The appellant and sixteen other men were  tried  in  Paris  before  the
    Tribunal de Grande Instance on 30 June 1998.  They  were  charged  with
    the French conspiracy charge of  participating  in  an  association  of
    wrongdoers with a view to the  preparation,  characterised  by  one  or
    several material facts, of a terrorist offence punishable by a sentence
    of 10 years. The offence was one of a number of anti-terrorist measures
    introduced into French law in the early 1990s.   As  has  already  been
    noted by the Court of Appeal these  laws  have  been  controversial  in
    their application to conspiracy cases.

41. Tehari, who was charged only with the terrorism offence, was  convicted
    and sentenced to five years' imprisonment and permanent exclusion  from
    French territory.  Nothing further is heard of him in the French  court
    documents in the present appeal. The three scientists were acquitted of
    all  charges,  the  determination  in  relation  to  Bouabdallah  being
    reserved and the other two judgments pronounced orally.

42. The appellant was convicted at first instance  only  of  the  documents
    charge, sentenced to six months in prison, but not excluded from French
    territory.  His cousin KS was also convicted in relation to his custody
    of the two falsified  documents  and  irregular  stay  in  France.   He
    received a sentence of four months' imprisonment and no exclusion  from
    French territory.

43. The forgery group were all convicted only of documents  charges.   They
    received sentences varying from just a few months to 14 months.   Those
    who were in France irregularly were also excluded from French territory
    for three years:  those who had leave to remain received  no  exclusion
    sentence.

The Cour d'Appel
44. The French prosecutor appealed against all the acquittals.   There  was
    one additional defendant, Abdelhakim Dridi. Most of the defendants  did
    not appear or arranged representation; most of them appear to have been
    served, but three of the document forgers had no known address by  this
    stage.  The cases of the missing defendants were decided in absentia.

45. The four defendants who appeared at the Cour d'Appel hearings were this
    appellant, his cousin KS, and two of the  three  scientists,  Drif  and
    Ouadou.  All of them were legally represented at the beginning  of  the
    hearings.  KS and the scientist Ouadou had separate  lawyers.   At  the
    beginning of the appeal, Drif (the other scientist) and  the  appellant
    were represented by the same lawyer.

46. On the first day of hearing the appeal, 16  September  1999,  the  Cour
    d'Appel heard oral evidence from the appellant and KS. However,  during
    that day, Drif indicated that he wished to  be  separately  represented
    and that he no longer wished the appellant's lawyer to  represent  him.
    At the end of the first day, the Court appointed a lawyer to  represent
    Drif, and adjourned the appeals for a week.

47. When the case resumed on  23  September  1999,  the  Court  heard  oral
    evidence from Drif and Ouadou, submissions from  the  Assistant  Public
    Prosecutor, and from KS's lawyer.  The following  day,  oral  pleadings
    were taken from lawyers  for  the  appellant,  Drif  and  Ouadou.   The
    appellant, Drif, Ouadou and KS were also  permitted  to  make  personal
    statements to the court. The  Court  reserved  its  judgment  until  22
    October 1999. When the hearing resumed, the Court formally  joined  the
    case of the absent defendant Dridi to that of the other defendants.

48. The judgment sets out the submissions of each party.   In  relation  to
    the appellant, the Prosecutor  highlighted  the  improbability  of  his
    statements being true and asked the Court to overturn the acquittal  on
    the charge of being involved in a criminal gang,  and  for  him  to  be
    convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison and permanent  exclusion
    from French territory.  The appellant's lawyer submitted that there was
    no case against him; that there was no evidence that he  was  preparing
    an act of terrorism or even intended to, nor that he was in  possession
    of a  weapon  or  explosives;  and  that  the  Court  had  two  options
    available, either to take a 'blinkered approach'  and  convict,  or  to
    uphold the first Court's decision.

The lesser defendants

49. The Court's decision dealt  first  with  the  lesser  defendants.   The
    prosecutor deferred to the opinion of the Court in relation to  Layachi
    and Touhami, and in relation to the motivation of Hanachi and KS  since
    'they could  have  been  manipulated'.  The  Cour  d'Appel  upheld  the
    acquittals of Layachi, Medjadi and Touhami on  the  conspiracy  charge,
    but upheld both conviction and sentence  in  relation  to  Touhami  and
    Layachi for unauthorised residence.  In relation to Hanachi, the  Court
    confirmed his earlier conviction for documents offences  and  the  five
    months sentence imposed by the first court.

50. In relation to KS, the Court noted that he had never  claimed  to  have
    been  manipulated  or  forced  to  look  after  the  appellant's  false
    documents, by the  appellant  or  anyone.   Rejecting  the  prosecution
    concession, the Cour d'Appel considered that KS must have known that it
    would be legally  impossible  to  exclude  the  appellant  from  French
    territory since he faced a death sentence in  Algeria.   There  was  no
    reason therefore for himself to fear refoulement  to  Algeria  and  the
    appellant's creation of a fake passport for himself  'could  only  have
    been intended to help [the appellant] evade being discovered in France,
    which means that he must have been involved  in  France  in  committing
    acts which are punishable under [French] criminal law'.  A four months'
    suspended sentence did not adequately reflect the seriousness  of  KS's
    offence and only a custodial sentence would do.  He  was  sentenced  to
    five  months'  imprisonment  and  five  years'  exclusion  from  French
    territory.

51. In the case of Kridech, the Court upheld his documents conviction.   As
    one of the forgery unit, he was in contact with the members of a  group
    which was sufficiently organised to steal and sell blank passports, had
    boasted to Nassah about it and suggested to two other  people  that  he
    could provide them with forged documents.  He had suggested himself  to
    Nassah as a supply source of  forged  documents.   However,  the  Court
    found that Kridech was not linked to the terrorists:   he  was  a  mere
    criminal.  They considered that the sentence below did not sufficiently
    reflect that he both  stole  and  used  forged  documents  and  did  so
    frequently.  Kridech had subsequently married a French  wife,  but  the
    offences were committed before he did so; the marriage was  disregarded
    in concluding that a sentence of  ten  months  (not  the  seven  months
    imposed by the Court below) and an additional  penalty  of  ten  years'
    exclusion from French territory better reflected the seriousness of his
    actions.

52. In the case of Bouhemila, the Court  upheld  the  documents  conviction
    below.   It reversed his acquittal in part, and convicted him of  being
    an accessory to the principal charge committed by Nassah of  unlawfully
    obtaining  administrative  documents,  but  upheld  the  acquittal   in
    relation to the terrorism conspiracy charge.    In  place  of  the  six
    months' imprisonment and three  years'  exclusion  imposed  below,  the
    court imposed a year's imprisonment and permanent exclusion from French
    territory, as the defendant had been  fully  integrated  into  Nassah's
    documents ring, even staying at the Foyer Sonacotra run  by  Nassah  in
    Nanterre.

53. Mehaibia's acquittal on the terrorism charge was  overturned.   He  had
    worked out of the Foyer Sonacotra in Nanterre, where he  was  arrested.
    He  worked  with  Khankar  importing  second-hand  cars   to   Algeria,
    falsifying registration cards for those vehicles.  He was able  to  say
    without difficulty how much it would cost to get a false work permit in
    Italy; he left his own passport  in  Naples  where  he  visited  Nasser
    Yacine, who was known to be involved with FIS.    He was  sentenced  to
    18 months in prison on appeal,  and  permanent  exclusion  from  French
    territory.

54. The additional defendant, Dridi, had been involved with Nasser, Khankar
    and Mehaibia in the export of second-hand vehicles to  Algeria  and  in
    falsifying the vehicle documents, to make the cars seem newer than they
    were.  He dealt with Khankar via Nasser and assisted them in  supplying
    false documents. That was a lucrative criminal business, but  the  Cour
    d'Appel considered that Dridi's part in it was merely criminal and  not
    connected with terrorism.  He was convicted  as  an  accessory  to  the
    document forgery charges and sentenced to a fixed  prison  term  of  18
    months and permanent exclusion from French territory.

55.  Similarly, the  Cour  d'Appel  upheld  the  sentences  of  Meddah  and
    Dahdouh, for possession of false documents, but did not  consider  that
    they were part of the terrorism conspiracy group,  partly  because  the
    group had charged Dahdouh a substantial amount (Fr. 30,000) for a false
    residence card.  The court did not consider that the network would have
    charged a member of the terrorist group for a false document.   Dahdouh
    had been allowed to use Nassah's accommodation at the Foyer  Sonacotra.
    In relation to Meddah, the Cour d'Appel upheld  the  decisions  of  the
    Tribunal de Grande  Instance  in  all  respects,  save  that  it  added
    exclusion from French territories.

56. Khankar's case was more serious.  He was living  unlawfully  in  France
    and moving around on a false French passport in another name.   He  was
    closely connected to Nassah in France, Yassine in  Italy,  and  Chaouki
    the German forger.  He had travelled to visit Yassine in Naples.   When
    making his asylum claim to OFPRA (the French Office for the  Protection
    of Refugees and Stateless  Persons),  he  had  claimed  to  be  an  FIS
    militant.  He was involved in the  vehicle  exportation  ring,  forging
    registration cards for vehicles to be sent to Algeria.  The  Court  was
    satisfied that he was deeply involved in the conspiracy  and  that  his
    criminal offences were committed in connection with  an  individual  or
    collective undertaking with terrorist aims.  It reversed his  acquittal
    and sentenced him to two years in prison and permanent  exclusion  from
    French territory.

57. Abaidia was deeply involved in the forgery ring, with  Dahdouh,  Nassah
    and Bouhemila. In his case, there was no question  of  his  involvement
    being merely criminal:  he had  supplied  forged  documents  to  Nassah
    while aware that Nassah was connected, or a member of, the FIS  or  the
    GIA.   The  Cour  d'Appel  substituted  a  sentence   of   two   years'
    imprisonment and permanent exclusion from French territory.

The main defendants

A.   The appellant

58. The next defendant to  be  considered  was  the  appellant.   The  Cour
    d'Appel reviewed the original proceedings relating to  him,  both  oral
    and documentary. They  heard  two  hours  of  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant.  He was legally represented, and originally shared a  lawyer
    with Drif.  They  heard  submissions  from  his  lawyer  and  gave  the
    appellant a final opportunity to speak directly to the court.

59. They endorsed the finding by  the  first  court  that  the  allegations
    against the appellant in relation to the Algiers  airport  attack  were
    not decisive of his involvement in terrorism in France,  and  that  the
    Algerian offence was not within the jurisdiction of the  French  court.
    They noted that the appellant had never been questioned by the Algerian
    authorities  and  claimed  to  have  left  Algeria  on  the  basis   of
    information that he had been implicated, which he claimed was given  to
    him by a member of the Algiers police force who knew him.

60.   The  Cour  d'Appel  gave  weight  to  the  appellant's  admitted  FIS
    sympathies; his use of his van as  an  informal  ambulance  during  the
    events of 1991 when the Algerian authorities had banned ambulances; and
    his friendship with Abderrahim, an FIS deputy who had been sentenced to
    death for his role in the Algiers Airport attack, and  executed.   They
    had regard to the change in the appellant's account as to who told  the
    Algerian authorities of his alleged involvement in the  attack;  he  at
    first claimed that it was Abderrahim  who  had  told  the  authorities;
    later, he changed that account and said it was a  baker  named  Allili.
    The Cour d'Appel was surprised that a man who was  under  suspicion  in
    this way had been able to obtain a business tourist  visa  for  France,
    and leave Algeria, apparently without difficulty.

61. Once in France, the appellant had not claimed asylum promptly:  he  had
    waited over three years.  When his business tourist  visa  expired,  he
    had applied for and been given three one-year residence permits, and he
    had not claimed asylum until the third was about to run out.

62. Between  the  two  dates  when  the  appellant  claimed  to  have  been
    interviewed by the Direction de la Surveillance  du  Territoire  (DST),
    while he still had a valid residence  permit,  and  before  he  claimed
    asylum, the appellant had approached a document forger,  claiming  that
    his status was precarious.  At that time it was not.  The appellant had
    been given the standard  formal  receipt  (r�c�piss�)  for  his  asylum
    application while it was  under  consideration,  which  he  could  show
    within France and which prevented his being refouled to  Algeria  until
    the asylum application had been completed.   The  reason  he  gave  for
    needing forged documents was not credible and  his  possession  thereof
    was never justified.

63. The Cour d'Appel rejected as unsatisfactory the appellant's explanation
    for his having the Guterriez passport, which  was  a  genuine  passport
    stolen from its owner and altered for  his  use.   Nor  was  the  court
    satisfied with the explanation  the  appellant  gave  for  putting  the
    photograph of his brother in Algeria, which he just  happened  to  have
    with him, in another 'lost' identity card in the name  of  Wane.    His
    brother was a shopkeeper in Algiers with no connection to  the  Algiers
    airport attack.   The court considered that the circumstances in  which
    the brother had  been  intended  to  use  the  Wane  document  remained
    unknown.

64. The overall chronology gave the lie to the appellant's account  of  his
    reasons for having a forged French passport and  the  court  considered
    that the document must have been prepared to enable  the  appellant  to
    move clandestinely around inside and  outside  French  territory.   The
    appellant had hidden both documents in an envelope given to KS for safe
    keeping; the court did not consider that he would have done  so  unless
    he was expecting his own address to be searched by the police, based on
    the actions he had committed since arriving in France.

65. Drif's  number  had  been  found  written  down  at  the  home  of  the
    appellant's brother, in Choisy-le-Roi, where he had stayed from time to
    time.  The appellant told the authorities that he was sure his  brother
    did not know Drif:  if that was so, the only explanation for Ghomri and
    Drif having written down the brother's phone number  in  their  address
    books was the  relations  existing  between  the  appellant,  Drif  and
    Ghomri.

66. The appellant had links with members of the Lille and Lyon  GIA  groups
    which he had attempted to conceal.  He was in contact with Mehdi Ghomri
    and Khaled Kheder, who were both in contact with a member of  the  Lyon
    GIA group, Joseph Jaime. The appellant at first denied knowing  Ghomri,
    but Ghomri, when interviewed, admitted knowing both the  appellant  and
    Kheder.  Confronted  with  these  statements,  the  appellant  admitted
    knowing them both.  He said he had worked with them at Relais H  kiosks
    in Marne-la-Vall�e and Paris Gare de Lyon.

67. The appellant admitted being in  touch  with  Ali  Touchent,  the  main
    person in charge of the Lille group.  Another man, Ali Ben Fattoum, had
    been questioned during the investigation of Karim Koussa, one member of
    a three-man cell entrusted by  Bensa�d  with  committing  the  Wazemmes
    market attack.  The other two members of that cell  were  Belkacem  and
    Dridi.

68. The appellant had used a particularly complex way of  getting  hold  of
    Ghomri after the latter's arrest (it involved the  appellant's  sister,
    another of his brothers, Salim Ben El Hadj, Belkacem, and 'Radio  Notre
    Dame').  Using the same route, he had also tried to find out  what  was
    happening to Ali Ben Fattoum.

69. Having regard to the appellant's associates,  his  admitted  possession
    and imputed use of false documents,  and  setting  aside  any  concerns
    about the Algerian airport attack in relation to him, the Cour  d'Appel
    concluded that the  appellant  was  "in  close  contact  with  the  men
    implicated in the terrorist attacks committed in the Lyon region and in
    the North of France, and that his bothering to check whether his arrest
    was connected with  those  of  Ghomri  and  Kheder  demonstrates  their
    belonging to the same organisation".   The Court  considered  that  his
    acquittal before the Tribunal de Grande Instance was  unsafe  and  they
    overturned it.

70. The Cour  d'Appel  found  that  the  appellant's  possession  of  false
    administrative documents and his use thereof was for purposes connected
    with his involvement in a gang of criminals or an  arrangement  set  up
    with a view to committing acts of terrorism.  He was sentenced  to  two
    years' imprisonment, and permanent exclusion from French territory.


B.   Salem Nassah
71. Nassah did not appear.  His phone number was in the  Tehari  electronic
    diary, as well as in that of Bouabdallah, and Mourad  Chergui,  one  of
    the main leaders of  the  FIS.   He  admitted  having  altered  vehicle
    registration cards to make vehicles appear newer for sale; he had run a
    document falsification and accommodation facility for Algerians in  the
    Foyer Sonacotra in  Nanterre,  including  providing  accommodation  and
    documents to Chaouki,  a  forger  who  normally  lived  and  worked  in
    Germany.  Through Khankar, he  was  linked  to  the  survivors  of  the
    Lounici group, a significant  backer  of  Algerian  Islamic  resistance
    movements in Europe, and also with Yacine, in Naples, Italy.  He was at
    the centre of  a  network  which  trafficked  second-hand  vehicles  to
    Algeria, with forged documents increasing their value.

72. Using the prayer room at the Foyer Sonacotra, Nassah had organised  the
    unauthorised accommodation  of  numerous  Algerians  who  were  passing
    through and either  had  no,  or  forged,  documents  and  were  living
    clandestinely in France.  On 14 July 1995 a bag  of  weapons  had  been
    discovered at the Foyer Sonacotra.  Among those to whom Nassah provided
    hospitality at the Foyer Sonacotra  were  Dridi,  Ouch�ne,  Ben  Larbi,
    Chaouki, and the Chenine  brothers,  all  of  whom  were  known  to  be
    involved in trafficking weapons and supplying them  to  groups  backing
    Algerian terrorists.  He had knowingly given accommodation  to  persons
    whose mission was to collect weapons, and had maintained relations with
    others who did so.  He was described as "a hard, calm and authoritative
    figure, nothing could be done in  the  [Foyer  Sonacotra  in  Nanterre]
    without his knowledge".

73. Nassah himself had possessed documents to which he was not entitled, in
    the years 1994, 1995 and 1996, including  birth  certificates  in  four
    names, one of which supported an identity card and  passport  which  he
    kept for personal use (he had been unlawfully in France for 15 years by
    this time). He carried out a business of supplying forged documents for
    the  terrorist  organisation  and  in  order  himself  to  move   about
    clandestinely.  He had furnished false documents to Ben  Larbi  and  to
    Ouch�ne, and given longer term accommodation to Ben Larbi at the  Foyer
    Sonacotra, to which he was not entitled.  The verdicts on Ben Larbi and
    Nassah were overturned.  Due to the extreme seriousness  of  his  acts,
    the Cour d'Appel considered that Nassah should be  sentenced  to  three
    years' imprisonment and permanent exclusion from France.


C.   Ali Drif
74. When arrested, Drif was working as a  research  assistant  at  France's
    National Institute of Applied Science (INSA) in Lyons,  but  his  phone
    number was one of those in the Tehari electronic diary, and he did  not
    dispute having met Tehari.  Drif's own diary contained the  appellant's
    phone number (though he claimed that was  because  his  wife  knew  the
    appellant's sister-in-law, and that was why  he  had  the  number,  the
    appellant lived at the same address and the Cour  d'Appel  found  as  a
    fact that the number was recorded for the purpose  of  telephoning  the
    appellant, not his sister-in-law).  He had travelled  to  visit  Dhina,
    the exiled head of the FIS  in  Switzerland,  along  with  Bouabdallah,
    Ouadou, and Boulouh Messadek.  He  had  claimed  the  journey  was  for
    tourism, but they had certainly met Dhina  and  then  travelled  on  to
    Zurich where they spent two nights at the mosque.

75. Drif had made low voltage electric circuits  at  Ouguenoune's  request;
    had prepared simple ignition mechanisms and  tried  to  buy  fertiliser
    which could have been used to make a bomb. His obedience to Ouguenoune,
    who was close to the GIA,  was  striking.   Ouguenoune  was  linked  to
    Talhajt, who was implicated in the  Chalabi  network;  Drif  sought  to
    please him and anticipate his unexpressed wishes, lent him  money,  and
    collected him from Marseille after a 5 am  telephone  call.  The  court
    considered that the evidence indicated that when Ouguenoune left France
    that Drif, who had been Ouguenoune's right hand man, succeeded him.

76. The acquittal of Drif by the Tribunal de Grande Instance was overturned
    and he was convicted on all charges, with a prison  sentence  of  three
    years and permanent exclusion from French territory.


D.   Kamel Ouadou
77. The Cour d'Appel found that  Ouadou  had  visited  Switzerland  several
    times, three times meeting Dhina.  He was an FIS sympathiser.   He  had
    given contradictory evidence as to whether he had  visited  Amar  Blita
    and Mustapha Hamza in Zurich.  He knew Drif, Bouabdallah and  Abdelslam
    Ouili.

78. However, 'frequenting members claiming to be part of the  FIS  such  as
    Dhina and Ouili, demonstrating an opinion based on adherence to  ideas,
    or sympathising with a group or a political party because  of  what  is
    personally considered as unjust treatment by a government,  cannot,  in
    the absence of  positive  evidence  being  provided  from  information'
    suffice to meet the terrorism  conspiracy  charge.   The  Cour  d'Appel
    upheld the acquittal of Ouadou.


E.   Bouabdallah
79. There was more to the factual matrix in Bouabdallah's case.  He was  on
    a low income (Fr 4000 a month), but had managed to visit, 'for  studies
    or tourism', eight European countries, some of them several times,  had
    kept documents for Chergui at his home, was associated with  the  visit
    by Drif, his friend, to Ouguenoune in Chilly Mazarin, and with  Nassah,
    Ouch�ne, and Chaabane, all of whose numbers,  like  Bouabdallah's  own,
    were in the Tehari electronic  diary.   He  had  planned  and  given  a
    structured speech to a public meeting of the Fraternit�  Alg�rienne  in
    1992 or 1993. He had addresses for Islamic centres in  London,  Munich,
    Rome and Zurich.

80. Bouabdallah was sentenced to three years'  imprisonment,  and  excluded
    permanently from French territory.

The task for the Upper Tribunal

81. We propose to analyse the application of the exclusion clause  in  this
    case by reference to Article 1F(b). If there  are  serious  grounds  to
    consider that the appellant  was  guilty  of  a  serious  non-political
    offence he falls to be excluded, whether or not the acts for  which  he
    is personally responsible were also acts contrary to the  purposes  and
    principles of the United Nations.  If by contrast, the acts  for  which
    he was personally responsible were not serious  crimes,  then  applying
    the guidance of the Supreme Court in Al Sirri, we have  no  doubt  that
    they were not acts contrary to  the  purposes  and  principles  of  the
    United Nations.

82. The test is whether there are serious  reasons  to  consider  that  the
    appellant is guilty of conduct that amounts to a serious  non-political
    offence. This is something stronger than reasonable suspicion but  less
    than proof of guilt on the criminal  standard.  We  conclude  from  the
    relevant authorities, including those discussed by the Court of  Appeal
    in remitting this matter  to  ourselves  and  the  conclusions  of  the
    Supreme Court in Al-Sirri, that it is sufficient so to consider  if  it
    is more probable than not, on all the information before us,  that  the
    appellant personally participated in such a crime.

83. We accept that a serious crime for the purpose of the exclusion  clause
    cannot be defined purely by national law or the length of the sentence.
    We must search for the autonomous international  meaning  of  the  term
    rather than what might be  purely  national  law  concerns  about  what
    conduct should be penalised and sentencing policy.

84. To find the autonomous meaning we first examine the text of the Refugee
    Convention and then have recourse  to  any  supplementary  measures  of
    interpretation such as state practice in the application of the Treaty,
    the travaux pr�paratoires  and  the  purposes  and  principles  of  the
    Convention[2]. The scholarly work of Professor Grahl-Madsen, writing in
    1966, has always been considered of importance, as have  the  views  of
    UNCHR as expressed in the Handbook produced at the  request  of  States
    Parties  represented  in  the   executive   committee   of   the   High
    Commissioner's Programme.

85. It seems clear that the exclusion  clause  was  intended  to  have  two
    purposes: first, the prevention  of  abuse  of  the  asylum  system  by
    undermining extradition law or the mutual interest  amongst  states  in
    prosecuting  serious  offenders[3].  This  first  reason  can  have  no
    purchase where the offence has been prosecuted and the offender  served
    his punishment. The second is to exclude from protection those who have
    demonstrated by their conduct they are not worthy of it.   It  is  this
    purpose that is relevant here.

86. We think that limbs 1F(a) and (c) serve  to  illustrate  the  level  of
    seriousness required to engage Article 1F(b); the genus of  seriousness
    is at a common level throughout.  Those who commit war crimes and  acts
    against the principles and purposes of the  United  Nations  are  clear
    examples of people who are unworthy of protection.

87.  We reject an argument faintly  advanced  by  the  respondent  that  by
    contrast with Article 33 (2) of the Convention, where  protection  from
    expulsion (non-refoulement) is excluded where there is a conviction for
    a "particularly serious crime", the non-political crime referred to  in
    Article 1F(b) does not have to be particularly serious. The reason  for
    doing so lies in the French text, which is equally authentic in finding
    the true international meaning of "serious crime" in this context.

88. The French text of Article 1F(b) refers to  "un  crime  grave"  whereas
    that for Article 33 (2) refers to "un d�lit particuli�rement grave".[4]
    A crime in French law is a more serious class of offence than a  d�lit.
    According to Cornu's Vocabulaire Juridique (9th edition) 2011,  "crime"
    is a "transgression particuli�rement grave".  We accept, however,  that
    the classification of the offence in national law is not the issue  (as
    it happens the offences of which the appellant was convicted in  France
    were both d�lits).  The point is rather that the focus on  the  use  of
    the English  word  "crime"  in  both  Articles  loses  the  quality  of
    seriousness reflected in the French word. It may be that  the  language
    of the French text is where the UNHCR[5] and  the  commentators  obtain
    the notion that serious crimes were once capital crimes.

89.  However, we recognise that state practice in the  application  of  the
    exclusion clause has developed  inside  Europe  and  beyond,  and  that
    personal participation in a conspiracy to  promote  terrorist  violence
    can be a particularly serious crime for the purpose of  Article  1F(b),
    providing again that the focus is on the substance of the  conduct  [6]
    and undue emphasis is  not  given  merely  to  the  labels  applied  by
    domestic law.

90. The government of a hypothetical Ruritania  may  consider  that  public
    assembly without a prior police permit where the participants call  for
    a change of government is a form of terrorist conspiracy against public
    order, but no one else should.

91. Problems arise where a claimant participates in violence in  a  foreign
    conflict, but Al Sirri tells us that personal participation in  violent
    attacks directed against armed forces acting in a manner authorised  by
    international law can be sufficient. By contrast, in this case the aims
    of the terrorist association or conspiracy were  directed  against  the
    public order of France; it was neither a political offence nor could it
    be any form of justified self-defence against state violence.

92. The relevant crime may be an agreement to commit the criminal acts  (in
    English law a conspiracy), rather than a choate  crime[7].   Indeed  an
    agreement amongst many to commit crimes may be  an  aggravating  factor
    that makes it more serious  than  an  offence  committed  by  a  single
    person.  We are conscious that membership of an organisation  that  has
    committed such crimes is not enough; nor logically can mere  membership
    of the association or being party to a conspiracy suffice.  We need  to
    examine the role the claimant played personally in order  to  ascertain
    whether the crime was a serious  one  within  the  meaning  of  Article
    1F(b).  However, where  the  personal  acts  of  participation  by  the
    claimant take the form of assistance to others who are planning violent
    crimes, the nature of the acts thereby  supported  can  be  taken  into
    account.

93. A particular issue of concern to  Lord  Justice  Sullivan  was  whether
    there  was  sufficient  basis   for   satisfaction   as   to   personal
    participation in a serious crime, where the French prosecutor was  able
    to intervene and bring  charges  at  an  early  stage  of  preparation.
    However, as the whole of the decision and reasons of the  Cour  d'Appel
    had not been translated, the extent to which there had  been  terrorist
    acts actually carried out, and the connections with the criminal  group
    of which the claimant was a member, may not  have  been  apparent.   We
    consider the wider context of the conspiracy; the parts played  by  the
    principal characters in the indictment and the links between  them  are
    important in this case. Particularly important is the distinction drawn
    by the French court  between  those  whose  role  was  limited  to  the
    production of false documentation or transfer of  stolen  vehicles  and
    those involved in the planning and  support  for  the  objects  of  the
    conspiracy or terrorist association itself.  The former were considered
    merely criminal and given lesser  sentences.  The  appellant,  however,
    belonged to the second group and was given one of the longer sentences.



94. The final question is the weight we should attach to  the  decision  of
    the Cour d'Appel in respect of the findings made about  the  appellant.
    Criticisms have been advanced by the appellant of  both  the  procedure
    and the quality of the reasoning whereby the acquittal was reversed and
    a conviction substituted.   We  recognise  that  the  elements  of  the
    offence, the procedure of conviction on re-hearing on appeal, the means
    of proof and the applicable evidentiary rules are all unfamiliar to  an
    English common lawyer. However, none of these criticisms amounts  to  a
    sufficient reason to ignore the decision. Indeed,  by  comparison  with
    cases of the application of the exclusion  clause  by  reason  of  acts
    committed abroad where there has been no criminal investigation at all,
    we are fortunate to have the material and the analysis that we do have.



95. Mr Greatorex makes two  specific  submissions:  (i)  the  principle  of
    comity would suggest  that  we  should  give  effect  to  an  appellate
    decision of a senior sister court in the European family; (ii)  in  any
    event we should be alert to the fact that, even  with  the  translation
    perfected, as it has been, we have not seen the  dossier  of  evidence,
    and are not in position  to  try  the  case  for  ourselves.   We  give
    particular weight to the second submission, and further recognise  that
    if the appellant had been aggrieved with the decision of  the  Cour  d'
    Appel he could have appealed to the Cour de Cassation and to the  Human
    Rights Court in Strasbourg.

96. In  the  circumstances,  in  the  absence  of  some  strikingly  unfair
    procedural defect, we conclude that  we  should  accord  a  significant
    degree of respect to the decision of  the  French  court;  there  is  a
    particular degree of mutual confidence and trust between legal  systems
    that form part of the same legal order within the European Union.   The
    process deployed by the Cour d'Appel cannot be considered unfair. As we
    have already noted, the appellant was represented, appeared  personally
    and  gave  evidence;  he  was  able  to  fully  participate  in   those
    proceedings. We recognise,  however,  that  the  ultimate  question  of
    whether the conduct of which we are satisfied is  sufficiently  serious
    to justify exclusion  is  a  matter  for  ourselves,  as  the  tribunal
    deciding the exclusion issue rather than a foreign court  applying  its
    own penal laws.

97. The examination of seriousness should be directed at the criminal  acts
    when they were committed, although events in the supervening passage of
    time may be relevant  to  whether  exclusion  is  justified:  a  formal
    pardon, or subsequent acquittal, or other event illuminating the nature
    of  the  activity  may  be  relevant  to  this  assessment[8].  Despite
    suggestions to the contrary by  respected  commentators,  it  does  not
    appear to be the case that service of the sentence, or indeed  a  final
    acquittal, brings the application of the exclusion clause to an end[9].
    It may be that the passage of time may serve to remove  any  basis  for
    exclusion of protection but if so we have no  basis  for  deciding  how
    long a period  is  appropriate  and  in  reality  a  claimant  who  has
    protection against expulsion is likely to be eligible for settlement on
    long  residence  grounds  before  being  able  to  expiate  culpability
    sufficiently to acquire refugee status[10].

 Our decision

98. We have each reviewed the material for ourselves in the  light  of  the
    submissions advanced to us and the observations of the Court of Appeal,
    our analysis of the French material and the legal principles  discussed
    above.

99. We return to the core finding of the Cour d'Appel in  respect  of  this
    appellant. It concluded  (F 142):

         "In any case the reasons given by [AH] to justify the existence  of
         a fake French passport are contradicted by the  chronology  of  the
         alleged events, and it is obvious  that  he  must  have  used  this
         forged document to move around clandestinely inside and outside  of
         French territory. Besides, the circumstance that he gave this  fake
         passport and the fake identity card to his cousin  [KS]  inside  an
         envelope can only be explained  by  him  fearing  that  the  French
         police would search his  address.  Based  on  the  actions  he  had
         committed in FRANCE since his arrival on 18 October 1992."

        and it continued (F 143):

         "Although it is  accurate  as  the  former  judges  stated  in  the
         appealed ruling, that the assessment of [AH's] involvement and  his
         potential  responsibility  for  the  attack  committed  at  ALGIERS
         airport in 1992 does not fall within the jurisdiction of the French
         courts, and that it  would  not  demonstrate  his  belonging  to  a
         criminal gang connected to a terrorist undertaking  that  acted  on
         French territory during 1994 and  1995,  on  the  contrary  to  the
         former judges, the Court must find that (AH) was, during the course
         of this period and while he  was  on  French  territory,  in  close
         contact with the men implicated in the terrorist acts committed  in
         the Lyon region and in the North of France, and that his  bothering
         to check whether his arrest was convicted with those of GHOMRI  and
         KHEDER demonstrates their belonging to the same organisation.

         It was therefore by way of an analysis which is not shared  by  the
         Court that the former judges  acquitted  him  of  the   charges  of
         involvement in a gang of criminal or an arrangement set up in  view
         of committing acts of terrorism; and it was in order to move around
         in the context of the illicit activities of  this  organisation  or
         arrangement, and the need  to  evade  a  search  potentially  being
         carried out by the French police following the  acts  committed  in
         FRANCE by this organisation  or  arrangement,  that  the  facts  of
         falsifying  administrative   documents   and   use   of   falsified
         administrative  documents  upheld  by  the   former   judges   were
         committed."

100. This appellant was not an unwitting petty criminal  caught  up  in  the
    criminal actions of others, but a senior participant in the conspiracy,
    as reflected in the distinction in  sentences  imposed  by  the  French
    court.  The appellant received a sentence of two  years  and  permanent
    exclusion from the  territory  of  France.  Those  whose  actions  were
    considered merely criminal  received  sentences  of  five  to  eighteen
    months.  Most  participants  in  the  terrorist   conspiracy   received
    sentences of at least two years. Those who  received  longer  sentences
    were: Tehari who had a list of weapons for purchase and an encoded list
    of contacts and received a five  years sentence; the scientist Drif who
    had made electronic circuits and purchased fertilisers that  could   be
    used in explosive devices received a sentence of three  years;   Nassah
    who provided safe houses for terrorist arms traffickers who received  a
    sentence  of three  years;  and  Boudallah  who  was  an  international
    terrorist courier  with a similar  list  of  contacts  to  Tehari.  All
    members of the terrorist  group  were  permanently  excluded  from  the
    French territory. The appellant was  connected  to  Drif  and  Drif  to
    Tehari. The appellant was  also  in  contact  with  Gomri,  Kheder  and
    Touchent who were connected to terrorist attacks.

101. We put the appellant's FIS background  together  with  his  association
    with people who were planning terrorist violence during a  campaign  of
    such violence, his possession and use  of  a  forged  passport  in  the
    circumstances  found  by  the  French  court,  his  interest   in   the
    circumstances of the arrest of others and the methods used  to  conceal
    his connections with those others, his possession of a  false  identity
    document, and the timing of his acts with respect to violent acts  that
    were occurring as part of the campaign of terrorism in France.  We  are
    satisfied that it is  more  probable  than  not  that  the  appellant's
    personal participation in this criminal association:

          iv. was  not  confined  to  mere  possession  of  false  identity
              documents, but involved using these documents to move  within
              and outside France in support of other senior members of this
              association,  some  of  whom  were  planning  and   executing
              terrorist acts;  and

           v.   was based on knowledge of and support for  these  terrorist
              acts, albeit it did not extend to  the  appellant  personally
              executing these terrorist acts.

102. Overall, we are satisfied that there are serious  reasons  to  consider
    that the appellant committed a serious crime in France before coming to
    the United Kingdom and as a consequence, that he is excluded  from  the
    protection of refugee status and subsidiary humanitarian protection.

103. The asylum and humanitarian  protection  appeals  are  dismissed.  Each
    member of  the  panel  has  contributed  to  the  preparation  of  this
    determination.
