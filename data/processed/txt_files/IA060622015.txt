                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1.    This is an appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born on 25 August 1989,
      against the decision of Judge M A Khan, sitting at Hatton Cross on  13
      November 2015, dismissing his student appeal in his absence. The point
      on  which  the  appellant  was  given  permission  to  appeal  is  his
      contention that he never received a notice of hearing.   I  heard  his
      oral evidence about that, which was in line with what he says  in  his
      own very clear and well-drafted grounds of appeal.
2.   The appellant relates in the second paragraph of his grounds  occasions
    on which post had reached him during his  dealings  with  the  Tribunal
    immigration authorities, including the judge's decision, and goes on to
    say this:

         "Receiving the notice of hearing was very important for me, my case
         and my future.   Looking  at  the  above  records  we  can  clearly
         understand that I receive all of the  important  documents  that  I
         need to receive.  However, I did not receive the notice of hearing;
         I fail to understand why and how I did  not  receive  something  as
         important as the notice of hearing.  The only reasons I  can  think
         of are that royal mail lost the mail or I was not sent  the  notice
         of hearing by mistake.   I  was  not  at  fault  in  any  of  these
         situations, yet the loss is mine."

3.   What had happened, according to the file, which there is no  reason  to
    believe did not represent the true order of events, was that on 16 June
    2015 notice of hearing for 13 November was sent out to the appellant at
    the address that he had used all along, by ordinary second class post.

4.   The appellant was cross-examined on the basis that he had  produced  no
    written evidence from the post office to confirm either that  any  such
    letter had gone missing, or that he had made  the  enquiries  about  it
    which he says he did in person.  It is clear on  the  authorities  that
    the presumption that a document posted to someone's address will  reach
    him there is only a presumption.  It may be displaced by oral evidence.
     In the case of a letter sent by ordinary post,  there  is  nothing  to
    show that it has been received, and  I  am  prepared  to  consider  the
    appellant's evidence on this point strictly on its own merits.

5.   After the judge's decision was sent out on 8  December,  the  appellant
    obviously took some time to set out his case with supporting documents,
    and his grounds of appeal are dated 20 December.  They were received on
    22 December.  He had had no reason before that to suppose that anything
    had gone wrong and, in the absence of a recorded  delivery  sending  of
    the notice of hearing, it seems to me there was not likely  to  be  any
    documentary evidence which could be of any real help as to whether that
    notice of hearing had gone out or not.

6.   While it might have helped the appellant's case  to  get  some  written
    confirmation from the post office that he had made enquiries,  it  does
    not seem to me that those enquiries could reasonably have been expected
    to lead to any definite evidence as to whether the  notice  of  hearing
    had been delivered or not.  So, on this point, I accept the appellant's
    evidence and, on that basis, without of course the judge being  in  any
    way to blame for not knowing what the appellant would say, it seems  to
    me that the appellant did not have a  proper  opportunity  to  put  his
    case, and the decision will have to be re-made.

 7. In passing, I should say this.  The judge dealt with the  notice  point
    in this way: "Having considered the file I have decided to  proceed  in
    the appellant's absence.  I hear oral submission from the  respondent's
    representative all of which are set out in the record of proceeding" it
    being a very simple matter for the judge to  have  set  out  the  facts
    shortly as I have done about the date on which the  notice  of  hearing
    had been sent and to the address which had been used by  the  appellant
    before.



 8. Mr Maqsood relied as  a  further  basis  for  challenging  the  judge's
    decision to proceed in the appellant's absence  on  what  is  for  this
    field a very ancient authority, called Probath Chandra Deb [1990] ImmAR
    at paragraph 14.   That  was  a  decision  of  the  Immigration  Appeal
    Tribunal in a case when the appellant had also not appeared before  the
    adjudicator.  The appeal was  dismissed  for  other  reasons;  but  the
    Tribunal went on to say:

         "Leave to appeal was granted because the Tribunal  wish  to  stress
         that when Adjudicators are faced with  a  situation  such  as  that
         which arose in this case which is  by  no  means  uncommon,  it  is
         necessary to set out that they are satisfied that the  requirements
         of the Procedural Rules and Notices Regulations  where  appropriate
         have been complied with, and why they are so  satisfied.   Only  by
         doing so is it apparent that justice is being done."

 9. Those were days when the practice of the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal
    was  to  make  decisions  involving  far  more  respect  for  technical
    formalities than the Upper Tribunal now does.  If  this  had  been  the
    point on which I had been deciding the notice  ground,  then  I  should
    have taken the view that, while it would have been  desirable  for  the
    judge to have given the details of notice of hearing had been sent out,
    there was certainly no need for him to refer to specific provisions  of
    the Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014.  Those are in  any  event  now  much
    shorter than their 1984 equivalent, considered in Deb had been, and  as
    they stand provide this:

         '28. If a party fails to attend a hearing the Tribunal may  proceed
             with the hearing if the Tribunal -

             (a)  is satisfied  the  parties  have  been  notified  of  the
                  hearing or that reasonable steps have been taken to notify
                  the parties of the hearing, and

             (b)  considered that it is in  the  interests  of  justice  to
                  proceed with the hearing.'

10. While the way in which the judge treated  this  point,  simply  on  the
    basis that he had considered the file, was not on the  face  of  it  as
    clear as it might have been, it certainly allowed this appellant to see
    exactly what the problem had been, because he dealt  with  it  himself,
    very clearly as I have already pointed out, in his  grounds  of  appeal
    and there was no need, as a matter of law, for the judge to say more.

11. As for (b), about its being in the interests of justice to proceed,  it
    does not seem to me legally necessary for any first-tier  judge,  faced
    with a case in which notice of hearing has apparently  been  sent  out,
    but no appellant has appeared, to make  any  further  enquiries  unless
    there is something to put him on notice that that ought to be done.  Mr
    Maqsood, who has been most industrious in his researches,  referred  me
    to Karagoz [2003] AllER D 237 which is a decision of Wilson J,  sitting
    in the Administrative Court.  It makes it clear that evidence  of  non-
    receipt of a notice of hearing has to be considered on its merits which
    I have done in this case and  goes  on  to  say  obiter  "Although  not
    required by law, where a claimant  fails  to  appear,  the  adjudicator
    should seek to obtain explanation of that absence by asking  the  clerk
    to phone the claimant's solicitors".



12. That is a counsel of perfection.  Wilson J makes it quite clear that it
    is not required by law, and those with  any  experience  of  first-tier
    hearings will be well aware that there are often times  when  it  would
    serve no useful purpose.  However for the reason I have given, which is
    that I accept the appellant's evidence that  he  did  not  receive  the
    notice of hearing, the judge's decision has to be  set  aside  and  re-
    made.

13. As I made clear to the parties at the outset,  the  salient  ground  on
    which the appellant had been refused leave to remain as a student was a
    false answer which he had given in his application form.   The  history
    of the case was this.  On two occasions, in July  and  September  2009,
    this appellant had been refused entry  clearance  in  Pakistan  on  the
    basis that he had failed to produce the necessary supporting  evidence.
    However, on a third occasion in March  2010,  there  had  been  another
    refusal: this time the basis was that he had  produced  a  visa  letter
    issued by a college in this country and  "Several  attempts  have  been
    made by this office to verify the authenticity of visa  letters  issued
    by St. Georges College.  All such attempts have been  unsuccessful,  as
    detailed in the document verification report".

14. The appellant's evidence about that refusal is that  this  college  had
    lost its sponsorship status for one reason or another by the time those
    attempts had been made, and that is why  they  had  been  unsuccessful.
    The document verification report form is not before me, so that  is  as
    far as the evidence on this point goes.

15. In 2011 the appellant arrived in this country with leave to remain as a
    student until 28 October 2013, and on 27 October 2013 he  sent  in  his
    application for leave to remain.  As the on-line form makes  it  clear,
    it had been completed the  previous  day,  26  October.   The  relevant
    passage comes at page 5 of 11.  There are a  number  of  main  headings
    which appear in bold type.  The first is headed 'Entry clearance/visa'.
      There  the  appellant  answers,  entirely  correctly,  the  questions
    relating to his current successful obtaining of a student visa to  come
    to this country, and its validity.

16. The next section is headed 'Previous leave in the UK', and  contains  a
    number of questions, to all of which the appellant answers  'no'.   The
    first asks "Have you ever stayed in  the  United  Kingdom  beyond  your
    period of leave?", and 'no' was of course the  right  answer  to  that.
    The second asks whether the appellant had ever knowingly used deception
    when seeking leave, or entered this country illegally.  Again 'no'  was
    his answer to that.  The final question referred to his  being  removed
    from this country, once more 'no' was the right answer.

17. However the third question  was  "Have  you  ever  been  refused  entry
    clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain in the  UK?  ",  and  here
    the answer 'no' was quite clearly not only wrong, but wrong three times
    over.  I have considered the appellant's oral evidence  on  this  point
    very carefully.  As I have found already, he is an  intelligent,  well-
    educated young man who, so far as the notice point was concerned,  gave
    straightforward evidence, and quite clearly.



18. Looking at the appellant's evidence on the deception  point  again,  he
    said he did not have any help filling out this form.  He had done it on
    both previous occasions in its printed version; but this was his  first
    time doing it on line.  The only reasonable assumption I  can  make  is
    that the form appeared on line in the  same  way  as  it  does  in  the
    printed copy in front of me.

19. On that basis there might have been some temptation for a  careless  or
    uneducated appellant or applicant at that point simply to look  at  the
    second heading on page 5 of 11 'Previous  leave  in  the  UK',  and  to
    conclude that, since he had never had leave to  be  here,  it  did  not
    apply to him, and all those questions could safely be answered 'no'.

20. I am not satisfied that this is what happened in this appellant's case.
     Bearing in mind that that form was filled in when he had only been  in
    this country for two or 2� years, rather than five as he  has  now,  it
    seems to me that, even by then, he would have  been  quite  capable  of
    reading an on-line form and dealing with the questions it posed, as  he
    had dealt with the previous ones.  There is  nothing  whatever  unclear
    about the question "Have you ever been refused entry  clearance,  leave
    to enter or leave to remain in the UK?".

21. Mr Maqsood suggested that the appellant would have had nothing to  gain
    by giving the false answer 'no' to that question.  I do not accept that
    point: although, despite what had happened before,  the  appellant  had
    been given a student visa in 2011, he might well  have  supposed  that,
    once that he had got it, the previous refusals had been  forgotten.  On
    that basis, it could not have helped his case to mention them, and that
    may have been why he failed to do so. However, that  was  a  deliberate
    false answer on which the decision-maker and the judge were entitled to
    refuse this application, and to dismiss the appeal. Although I have re-
    made the decision, for the reasons I gave earlier,  that  is  also  the
    result I have reached.

Appellant's appeal against first-tier decision allowed: decision set aside
Decision re-made: appellant's appeal against Home Office decision  dismissed
